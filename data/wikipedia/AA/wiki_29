In the aspirator, fluid flows through it. The tube gets more thin, making the fluid flow faster, and making the pressure smaller. Then, vacuum is taken from it. The aspirator is also known as an ejector or a filter pump.\nThe most common type of aspirator is the water aspirator. It is used in laboratories for chemistry and biology. The aspirator has a fitted tee, which is attached to a faucet. It has a hose barb on one side. The flow of water passes through the straight part of the tee, which restricts the water flow at the intersection with the hose barb. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb.\nThe strength of the produced vacuum is limited by the vapour pressure of the flowing water. However, the strength of the vacuum is not limited if a gas is used as the working force."}

He studied to become an accountant, and made his living as the business manager of many celebrities, musicians in particular.\nEarly life.\nKlein was born in Newark, New Jersey and was of Hungarian Jewish descent. He married a woman named Betty, after he graduated from college. He first became well known when he helped a singer, Bobby Darin, to recover money owed to him by his record label. Darin received a $100,000 check for unpaid royalties, and split it with Klein. Klein was called the \"Robin Hood\" of popular music, liked by artists but hated by the companies they worked for.\nCareer.\nKlein bought a struggling record label, Cameo-Parkway, and tried to make it more profitable. When he got into legal trouble for \"talking up\" the value of shares in the company, he changed his plans. He merged Cameo-Parkway with his own accounting firm, creating a company called ABKCO (for Allen and Betty Klein and Company).\nAmong Klein's clients were pop singers Connie Francis, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm\u00e9, R&amp;B singer Sam Cooke, folk musician Donovan, record producer Phil Spector, and rock bands Herman's Hermits, The Animals, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. While he helped his clients with money matters, and to make new contracts that paid them better, not all his business choices were the best for his clients. Klein ended up owning much of the music of the Rolling Stones, the Animals and other artists, which cut into their long-term earnings. The artists also sometimes lost the goodwill of the businesses they dealt with, because of Klein's work for them.\nKlein played a role in the breakup of the Beatles. He impressed John Lennon enough to sign up with him overnight, and Lennon persuaded George Harrison and Ringo Starr to go along. Paul McCartney, though, decided to let his wife Linda's father Lee Eastman become his manager. Eastman and Klein did not get along, and Eastman treated Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono poorly. Disagreements on what the Beatles should be doing with their company Apple Corps, and their own business interests, helped to tear the band apart.\nAfter the Beatles broke up, Lennon, Harrison and Starr liked the things Klein did for them less and less, and eventually split with him, giving Klein a final payment of about \u00a33.5 million for his services. Later, Klein got into tax trouble, and served a two-month jail sentence for income tax evasion.\nKlein continued his career, and ABKCO continued to issue records from the old Cameo-Parkway label, and the artists Klein had managed. Nearly all the records were taken off the market for many years, making classic songs like \"96 Tears\" (by ? and the Mysterians), \"So Much In Love\" by the Tymes, and \"Bristol Stomp\" by the Dovells impossible to buy.\nKlein's son Jody became the controller of ABKCO, when Klein's health became poor. In 2005, ABKCO finally began to issue digitally remastered compact discs of the music owned by the company. Klein died in Manhattan of complications from Alzheimer's disease in July 2009."}
{"id": "65350", "revid": "7206457", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65350", "title": "Mark David Chapman", "text": "Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955 in Fort Worth, Texas) is an American prisoner. He is known for murdering British musician John Lennon.\nEarly life.\nChapman grew up in Georgia, and was a fan of British band the Beatles when they first became famous. He learned to play guitar and wanted to become a musician. He later became a fundamentalist Christian, and his values changed. He came to believe the Beatles were a bad influence on people, John Lennon in particular, because of Lennon's views on God and religion. When Lennon released his song \"Imagine\" in 1971, many fundamentalists disliked it. Chapman parodied the song, singing it as \"Imagine John Lennon dead.\"\nAs years went by, Chapman had little success and much trouble in his personal life. His hopes to become a missionary were dashed when a civil war started in the country where he went on a mission. He returned to the United States, and later moved to Hawaii. In 1979, he married a Japanese-American woman, as Lennon had done, but Chapman's marriage was unhappy. Chapman worked a low-paying job, as a security guard.\nMeeting (and murdering) Lennon.\nIn 1980, after years of retirement, Lennon made a new album, \"Double Fantasy\", with his wife Yoko Ono. Chapman learned from a book where Lennon lived in New York City, and that it was not hard to find him around town. Chapman flew to New York a few times that fall, thinking about what he wanted to do. He thought about committing suicide, before deciding finally to kill Lennon. He felt that doing this would somehow lessen the problems in his own life.\nOn December 8, 1980, Chapman again visited New York, meeting Lennon and Ono as they left home to go to a recording session. Lennon signed a copy of \"Double Fantasy\" for Chapman, and a photographer took a picture of the two men together. Chapman waited around until they returned. As Lennon entered their apartment building, Chapman drew a pistol, called out to Lennon, then shot him several times. Lennon collapsed, and died later on the way to a hospital from blood loss.\nAftermath.\nChapman did not try to get away, and was reading a book, \"The Catcher in the Rye\", when police came to the scene. They arrested Chapman, who later pled guilty to Lennon's murder, telling the court God had told him to do so. He was sentenced to twenty-five years to life in prison in 1981. He later wrote to Yoko Ono, trying to apologize to her and explain his actions, but she did not answer. In 1985, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman lost the chance to portray Lennon in a movie about his life with Ono, because his name was similar to that of Lennon's killer.\nWhen Chapman became eligible for parole, he applied but was turned down. Ono gave a statement to the court, telling them that Lennon's death still hurt her and their son Sean Lennon every day, and they still felt his loss. She reminded them of how Chapman's act was only one among many celebrity stalkings and murders, and that paroling Chapman might give others the idea that what he did was acceptable. The court heard her words, and Chapman continues to be refused parole.\nLennon's murder was echoed in December 1999 when a young man, Michael Abram, broke into the home of another former Beatle, George Harrison, carrying a knife. He wanted to kill Harrison for many of the same reasons Chapman killed Lennon. Harrison and his wife Olivia fought back, however, with Olivia striking Abram with a lamp, and the pair holding him down until police arrived. Harrison was stabbed by Abram, but he recovered. Abram was sent to a mental hospital.\nIt is believed that Chapman will never leave prison in his lifetime, because of the impact of his crime and the many death threats he has received over the years from other inmates and Beatles' fans. His name has been used in arguments promoting gun control, claiming that he would not have killed Lennon if he could not get a gun. (It is counterargued, however, that his plan was not simply to \"shoot\" Lennon, but to \"kill\" him; if he could not have used a gun, he would likely have tried another way. Abrams's later attack on Harrison supports this argument.)\nMany fans of Lennon have threatened to kill Chapman if he was ever released from prison. In 2000, Chapman said that Lennon would have wanted him to be free, saying \"I think he would be liberal, I think he would care.\""}

She was one of the most famous women in the world. Diana was a part of the same family of Sir Winston Churchill (Spencer Family)\nEarly life.\nDiana was born to royalty on 1 July 1961 as \"Diana Frances Spencer\"\"r\". She was born at Park House Hotel in Sandringham, Norfolk, England. Her father was the Earl Spencer. She left school when she was 16 and moved to London when she was 18.\nMarriage, family and divorce.\nIn 1981, Diana married Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral. They had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. \nCharles and Diana separated in 1992, and divorced in 1996. Diana said Camilla Parker-Bowles was responsible for the problems with her marriage. Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry an heir to the British throne in 300 years. Charles' brothers married commoners: Andrew, Duke of York, married Sarah Ferguson in 1986, and his youngest brother, Edward, Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. \nDiana's great-grandmother was an American heiress.\nChildren.\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury. On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced. In January 1982\u201412 weeks into the pregnancy\u2014Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist Sir George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured. Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\". On 21 June 1982, Diana gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William. She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy. Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William\u2014who was still a baby\u2014on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion.\nA second son, Prince Harry, was born on 15 September 1984. The Princess said she and Charles were closest during her pregnancy with Harry. She was aware their second child was a boy, but did not share the knowledge with anyone else, including Charles.\nDiana gave her sons wider experiences than was usual for royal children. She rarely deferred to Charles or to the royal family, and was often intransigent when it came to the children. She chose their first given names, dismissed a royal family nanny (and engaged one of her own choosing), selected their schools and clothing, planned their outings, and took them to school herself as often as her schedule permitted. She also organised her public duties around their timetables.\nCharity.\nThroughout her life, Diana was something of a rebel. Her work with victims of AIDS could, in some ways, be seen in this regard. She was one of the first very high profile people to be pictured touching those afflicted with AIDS, and this had a significant impact in changing people's opinions and attitudes to the disease. It was certainly a charity not following the protocol and tradition of the Royal family. As Princess Diana said:\n\u201cHIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them hug heaven knows they need it\u201d\nDiana had a very personable touch. She was very at ease in meeting people from any background and even if they were ill or in hospices. The patients would react very favourably to her meetings, they warmed to her life energy and heartfelt sympathy. Part of her appeal was her sympathy and natural compassion. She could empathise with people\u2019s suffering, having suffered much herself.\nTo the media, Diana often portrayed a very stoic and positive energy, but an aide suggested that at the same time these engagements often drained Diana emotionally at the end of some engagements she felt depleted.\nAs well as working on charities such as AIDS she lent her name to the campaign to ban landmines. Her personal support is said to have been a significant factor in encouraging Britain and then other countries to support the Ottawa Treaty which sought to introduce a ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines. When Robin Cook brought the second reading of the landmines bill to the house in 1998 he made a point of paying tribute to the contribution of Princess Diana.\nDeath.\nDiana and her boyfriend, Dodi Al-Fayed, died in a car crash in Paris, France, in the early morning of 31 August 1997. She was 36-years-old when she died. Many people left flowers, candles, cards and personal messages for her in public places. She had a big funeral in London on the 6 September 1997. \nConcerts for Diana took place shortly after her death. The concerts involved Elton John and numerous others. Elton John released a remake of his song, \"Candle in the Wind\" in memory of Diana.\nTitles.\nDiana's full title, once married, was \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Carrick, Baroness of Renfrew, Lady of the Isles, Princess of Scotland\". Legally, she was still entitled to use her previous royal courtesy titles after her divorce as long as she remained unmarried."}

He is better known by his ring name Hornswoggle. Postl is currently working for the WWE. He was the last WWE Cruiserweight Champion ever. Postl originally wrestled under the name of \"The World's Sexiest Midget\" Shortstack.\nCareer.\nPrior to working on \"SmackDown!\", Postl was best known for his work with NWA Wisconsin where he won its X Division Championship.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment.\nPostl signed with World Wrestling Entertainment in May 2007. He is the fourth wrestler from NWA Wisconsin to sign with WWE. The others were Daivari, Ken Kennedy and CM Punk.\nPostl first showed up as the leprechaun partner of the Irish wrestler Finlay on \"SmackDown!\" during the May 26 episode. After Finlay\u2019s victory over Paul Burchill, a little man (Postl) crawled out from under the ring and jumped on Burchill. Finlay pulled him off, only to slam him back down onto Burchill again. For the next few weeks the as-yet unnamed man continued to appear from under the ring after matches.\nEventually, \"SmackDown!\" commentator Michael Cole began calling him the Little Bastard. The name became popular and became his \"official\" name. Commentator JBL refused to call him \"Little Bastard\". JBL said, \"he \"might\" have parents\". He instead called him a leprechaun. This was confirmed in one edition of \"SmackDown!\" by Finlay.\nLittle Bastard soon became meaner. He started attacking during Finlay's matches even though it upset Finlay. Many times, Finlay either physically shoved Little Bastard back under the ring or was forced to tackle him before he could hit the person he was wrestling. At one point, Little Bastard attacked Finlay, biting Finlay when Finlay tried to stop him from attacking Gunner Scott.\nLittle Bastard was an important part of Finlay winning the United States Championship when he tossed him a shillelagh to knock out champion Lashley to win the match.\nOn February 23, his name was changed to Hornswoggle on WWE's website and all references to the name \"Little Bastard\" were removed. The name change became official on the March 2 episode of \"SmackDown!\". Postl attacked JBL and Michael Cole. Afterwards, Finlay told Cole that Little Bastard's name is Hornswoggle. Despite this, Cole continues to occasionally refer to Hornswoggle as \"Little Bastard\".\nOn July 22, 2007 at The Great American Bash Hornswoggle won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The other people in the match and commentators did not know that he was a participant in the match until the pin and he was given the belt. This made him the first person with dwarfism to win a Championship in WWE history. Hornswoggle is both the lightest and the shortest wrestler to win the Cruiserweight Championship in WWE history. He is also the smallest wrestler to win any title in WWE.\nPostl was drafted to ECW on June 25, 2008 as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft."}

For example, removing solid particles from a liquid. Filter can also mean the act of filtering: it can be used as a verb. The different branches of science and technology often mean a particular kind of device when \"filter\" is mentioned.\nIn chemistry.\nThe simplest filter is the kind called filter paper. Liquids can pass through the paper. Solid particles are stopped.\nMore advanced filters are possible. Two that are often used to make water more pure are activated carbon and zeolites.\nFilters are used to remove unwanted items and/or impurities in the substance you are filtering.\nIn electrical science.\nThe most usual thing meant by filter in electrical science is a wave filter. One common kind lets through some frequencies and stops all others. This is a band pass filter. For instance, in a radio it can select the radio station the listener wants to hear. The frequency of that station is passed, but all others are rejected.\nThere are many other uses, including use in telephones and audio, see: audio crossover.\nThere are digital filters which can be used to filter things besides frequencies. A common use is to improve the quality of pictures. For instance, there are filters which can make the edges of objects look more clear.\nIn optics and photography.\nOptical filters act on light. They change it certain ways. This can be used for photographic filters.\nIn mechanics.\nFilters can be made from mechanical components. They will do very similar things to electric filters. Most especially, mechanical filters can be wave filters. That is, they can block some frequencies and pass others. Because of this, electric filters are sometimes made by first making a mechanical filter. The electric wave is turned into a mechanical movement, then passed through the filter, then turned back in to an electric wave. This kind of filter is often made from quartz crystals.\nA device which changes electrical signals into mechanical signals is called a transducer. A device which changes mechanical signals into electrical signals is also a transducer, but one of a different kind.\nIn information technology.\nAn internet filter removes certain kinds of information. For example, certain words can be blocked."}

He served in the House of Representatives (as Speaker), in the Senate, and was Secretary of State. He ran for President several times but never won. He wanted the United States to fight the British in the War of 1812. After years in the Democratic-Republican Party he started the Whig Party to oppose Andrew Jackson.\nHe helped pass the famous compromises over slavery leading up the Civil War, including the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850. He is considered to be one of the greatest Senators in United States history.\nEarly life and education.\nChildhood.\nHenry Clay was born on April 12, 1777, at the Clay farmhouse in Hanover County, Virginia, in a story-and-a-half frame house. It was an above-average home for a common Virginia planter of that time. At the time of his death, Clay's father owned more than 22 slaves, making him part of the planter class in Virginia (those men who owned 20 or more slaves). He also ate copious amounts of cabbage to survive the cold winter months.\nHenry was the seventh of nine children of the Reverend John Clay and Elizabeth Hudson Clay. His father, a Baptist minister nicknamed \"Sir John,\" died four years after his birth in 1781. The father left Henry and his brothers two slaves each, and his wife 18 slaves and of land. Henry Clay was a second cousin of Cassius Marcellus Clay, who became an abolitionist in Kentucky.\nThe widow Elizabeth Clay married Capt. Henry Watkins, who was a loving stepfather. Henry Watkins then moved the family to Richmond, Virginia. Elizabeth had seven more children with Watkins, having sixteen.\nEducation.\nHis stepfather secured Clay employment in the office of the Virginia Court of Chancery, where he showed a skill for law. There he became friends with George Wythe. Wythe chose Clay as his secretary. After Clay was employed as Wythe's faculty for four years, the chancellor took an active interest in Clay's future; he arranged a position for him with the Virginia attorney general, Robert Brooke. Clay received no formal legal education but, as was customary at the time, \"read the law\" by working and studying with Wythe, Chancellor of the Commonwealth of Virginia (also a mentor to Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall, among others) and Brooke. Clay was admitted to practice law in 1797.\nMarriage and family.\nAfter starting his law career, on April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in Lexington, Kentucky. She was a sister to Captain Nathaniel G. S. Hart, who died in the Massacre of the River Raisin in the War of 1812.\nClay and his wife had eleven children (six daughters and five sons): Henrietta (1800\u20131801), Theodore (1802\u20131870), Thomas (1803\u20131871), Susan (1805\u20131825), Anne (1807\u20131835), Lucretia (1809\u20131823), Henry, Jr. (1811\u20131847), Eliza (1813\u20131825), Laura (1815\u20131817), James Brown, (1817\u20131864), and John (1821\u20131887).\nSeven of Clay's children died before him and his wife. By 1835 all six daughters had died of many conditions, two when very young, two as children, the other two as young women: from whooping cough, yellow fever, and complications of childbirth. Henry Clay, Jr. was killed at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War.\nLucretia Hart Clay died in 1864 at the age of 83. She is buried with her husband in Lexington Cemetery. Henry and Lucretia Clay were great-grandparents of the suffragette Madeline McDowell Breckinridge, a family member of John C. Breckinridge, who was Vice President of the United States during James Buchanan's presidency."}

He first became famous because of his defense of New England shipping interests. In his life, he became more and more nationalistic, and convinced many people to become nationalists too. This made Webster one of the most famous orators and powerful Whig leaders of the Second Party System. Webster did not like slavery, but he thought it was more important for the Union (the United States) to stay together than anything else.\nWebster became the northern member of a group known as the \"Great Triumvirate\". They included his colleagues Henry Clay from the west and John C. Calhoun from the south. His \"Reply to Hayne\" in 1830 was generally seen as \"the most eloquent (powerful, fluent, well-spoken) speech ever delivered in Congress.\"\nWebster tried to keep the nation from civil war, and make them have a firm peace. His efforts did not succeed, but he was still respected for them. He was officially named by the U.S. Senate in 1957 as one of its five best members.\nEarly life.\nDaniel was born on January 18, 1782. His parents were Ebenezer and Abigail Webster (n\u00e9e Eastman) in Salisbury, New Hampshire, now part of the city of Franklin. He and his nine siblings grew up on his parents' farm. Daniel Webster's great-great-grandfather was Thomas Webster (1631\u20131715). Thomas Webster was born in Ormesby St. Margaret, Norfolk, England and settled in New Hampshire. As Daniel was a \"sickly (unhealthy) child\", his family often let him have whatever he wanted and he didn't have to work on the farm.\nCareer.\nDaniel Webster became a lawyer and politician. He was elected to Congress as a Federalist. He supported free trade, opposed both Abolitionism and the expansion of slavery, and opposed the War of 1812 and other policies of the Democrats. When the Federalist Party declined, he joined with other former Federalists and National Democrats to form the Whig Party (United States). Always Webster supported the unity and harmony of the nation against various divisive schemes."}

{"id": "65424", "revid": "7425152", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65424", "title": "Jury nullification", "text": "Jury nullification is a jury on purpose ignoring evidence or refusing to apply the law as explained in the jury instructions. A jury may feel the application of the law is unfair, unjust, or immoral in some way or may want to \"send a message\" about some social issue.\nJury nullification is not a legal function of a jury and is not usually considered to be consistent with a jury's duty to judge a case on the facts and the law.\nIt is clear that juries have the power to nullify. However, it is another question on if they have the right to nullify. Once the verdict of not guilty is returned, double jeopardy applies and so the defendant cannot be tried again. If a judge learns that a juror intends to nullify the verdict, the judge has the right to remove that juror. Typically, jurors are not told by the court that they have the power to nullify. Judges fear if they told jurors they would have jury anarchy on their hands with jurors doing whatever they please. However, jury nullification can provide valuable feedback and is sometimes useful if it is used wisely.\nHistory.\nJury nullification goes back to the beginnings of the jury system in England as established by the Magna Carta in 1215. The practice came to the United States during the colonial period. The case thought to be the precedent for jury nullification in the US is that of John Peter Zenger in 1735. He was put on trial for seditious libel. Zenger had criticized the governor in his newspaper, \"The Weekly Journal\". Trying everything he could to insure a guilty verdict, the governor even had Zenger's lawyers disbarred to prevent him from having legal representation. But the jury refused to convict him, going against the judge's orders.\nDiscriminatory acquittal.\nAlong with a history of jury nullification in the US, there is also a history of discriminatory acquittals. \nAn example of discriminatory acquittal is when jury nullification is used to punish female rape victims by allowing their rapists to go free. The same is true of female victims of domestic violence. The \"appropriateness\" of a female victim's behavior in court can a great deal to do with how a jury will act, according to studies on the subject. Another example is the 1991 case of Rodney King. King was an African-American man who was beat up by police officers on videotape. The jury acquitted the police officers of beating him up even though they watched the video in court.\nArguments against jury nullification.\nJury nullification can be a way for a jury to express their own prejudice and bias. Examples include all-white juries enforcing Jim Crow laws on black defendants while letting white defendants who committed racial crimes against blacks go free. Also, it can seem unfair to allow one defendant to go free for committing the same crime while another defendant is convicted, just because one jury decided to nullify the law. This challenges the concept of equal protection under Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn the 1895 Supreme Court decision \"Sparf v. United States\" the Court ruled that judges did not have an obligation to tell jurors about jury nullification. The decision did not say judges could not tell jurors about nullification or that jurors did not have that power. They only said judges were not required to tell jurors. This led to the now common practice of judges in the U.S. penalizing defense attorneys who try in any way to present a nullification argument.\nArguments for jury nullification.\nWhen a jury lets guilty people go free, it is called jury nullification. When a prosecutor decides not to charge a guilty person of a crime, it is called \"prosecutorial discretion\". Prosecutors are legal professionals while jury members are not. However prosecutors are also politicians and may make politically motivated decisions or may be corrupt. Judges will often instruct a jury to return a verdict based on the merits of the case and not the merits of the law. But one argument is that juries have a responsibility to decide if they think the law is wrong in a particular case. \nA person who overreacts when seeing someone commit a crime may be guilty of a crime themselves. For example, if a child is killed by a drunk driver and the father then kills the drunk driver, according to law the father may be guilty of murder. The same is true if a man seeing someone sexually assaulting his wife or daughter and beats the attacker to death (in many jurisdictions). A jury is made up of people who live in a community. They can decide to let someone go free if they think is it safe to do so. "}

It was also the twenty-sixth tropical or subtropical storm of the active 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\nTropical Storm Delta formed out from an extratropical cyclone that slowly gained tropical characteristics. It was also a subtropical storm for a very short time before becoming \"Tropical Storm Delta\" on November 22. Delta then moved slowly and stubbornly to the Canary Islands. It became extratropical again on November 29, just before passing north of the islands.\nStorm history.\nOn November 22, a non-tropical low pressure system in the central Atlantic Ocean began to gain some tropical characteristics. Late that afternoon the low became Subtropical Storm Delta, while located over 800 miles (1300 km) west-southwest of the Azores. Originally, the National Hurricane Center thought that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a regular tropical storm, but in post-storm analysis this was changed.\nThe storm's circulation became more organized and Delta became a tropical storm on November 24. It strengthened further to its maximum strength of 70 mph (110 km/h) winds later that day, just below hurricane strength. The official forecast at this time predicted that Delta would strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane, but this did not happen. Anyhow, Delta kept this strength for a few days as it moved slowly and zig-zaggedly in the central Atlantic. As wind shear increased over the storm, a Delta began weakening on November 25 and by the end of the next day Delta had weakened into a very weak tropical storm. Some of the computer models showed that the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which a few days later became Hurricane Epsilon. This did not happen, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast.\nAs Delta sped up to the northeast heading to the Canary Islands, it strengthened again, reaching a second peak of just below hurricane strength on November 27. In post-storm analysis, the National Hurricane Center said that Delta had probably reached hurricane strength for a very short time during that day; but the data was not persuading enough to upgrade the storm to hurricane status. On November 28, as Delta moved closer to the Canary Islands, Tropical Storm Delta lost much of its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, came close to about 105 miles (165 km) while north of the islands that night. The storm later made landfall on Morocco early on November 29 and quickly weakened overland, dissipating later that day over northwestern Algeria.\nImpact.\nA lot of damages was reported in the Canary Islands from the effects of Delta, where it was described as a \"historic\" event, as hurricanes are very rare there. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported there. The strongest gust recorded at La Palma was 152\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 147\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). One hospital had to be evacuated and several airports were closed across the islands. In all, more than 225,000 customers lost electricity and many lost telephone service.\nAlso, a famous natural tourist attraction, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for more than a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was destroyed by Delta's winds and wave movement along Gran Canaria's shore. Gran Canaria it was the island that suffered more damages in its Patrimony, since besides the storm destroyed centenary windows and crosses, the cover of the Cueva Pintada in Galdar, and stopped prisoners and without light several villages of the center of the island. Delta claimed seven lives; six of them were immigrants that were on a boat which sank off the Canary Islands and 12 were reported missing. The seventh was a result of winds throwing a man off a house while it was being repaired during the storm.\nThe total damage caused by Tropical Storm Delta throughout the islands was estimated to be over \u20ac312 million ($364 million 2005 US dollars). Delta was also blamed for a 10-15% reduction of the islands tuna catch, as it kept the fishermen in port for several more days. Delta was described as a \"normal atmospheric disturbance\" in Morocco and no damage was reported there. In fact, it was welcomed as farmers needed the rain there to finish the sowing of cereal crops.\nNaming and records.\nWhen Subtropical Storm Delta formed on November 22, it was the first and earliest time that twenty-six tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the Atlantic during one hurricane season; it also extended the 2005 season's record for the number of storms in a single season."}

{"id": "65563", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65563", "title": "Fall of Man", "text": "The Fall of Man (also called \"The Story of the Fall\" or \"The Fall\") is the story in the book of Genesis in the Torah (Old Testament) of when Adam and Eve, in God's eyes, lost their innocence. Genesis says that Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge even after God told them it was not allowed. Adam and Eve lost their innocence and were thrown out of the Garden of Eden, where the Tree of Knowledge was. In Christian religion, all of man lost their innocence because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and had to be punished, so man can now tell good from bad and life from death.\nThe Fall, for many Christians, means humans can not make themselves holy enough to get into Heaven when they die. It is only possible to get into heaven because Jesus Christ sacrificed himself.\nBeliefs.\nJudaism, Christianity and Islam believe the story of the Fall is the truth, but each explains it differently.\nIslam.\nIslam says the Fall was just a historic event and did not change human nature at all. It says Adam and his wife were thrown out of the Garden of Eden and forced to work and suffer because Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge. But God still gave others who were still loyal to him the chance to get into Heaven.\nJudaism.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Adam and Eve had the free will to rebel against God's first commandment. One of God's first commandments was not to eat from the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve ate from its fruits and had to pay a price. They were thrown out of the Garden of Eden, which is called Paradise, and they had to suffer and work to survive. Adam and Eve also became \"like God\" when they ate the fruit from the tree. They got the gifts of knowledge, wisdom, and self-awareness\u2014things that seperate humans from animals. Judaism teaches that eating the fruit was disobedience, but not sin. Unlike Christianity, Judaism teaches that sin can not be inherited, and that people do not inherit \"Original Sin\". If a sin is committed, you may pray directly to God and ask for forgiveness, and if the sin has affected another person, you may also ask their forgiveness. Judaism says every person can get to heaven and be\u2014once more\u2014near to God. You do not have to be Jewish to get into heaven.\nJudaism teaches these things about \"The Fall\":\nChristianity.\nChristians generally believe that everyone who is related to Adam is born with sin and would never make it into Heaven. Jesus, who was related to Adam only through Jesus' mother, had no sin, and died to remove the sins of those who believe in him. They believe that whoever believed in Jesus Christ was given a \"second chance\" to get back into Heaven, shown in John the Apostle's Gospel: \"...God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16, ERV) Different types of Christianity have slightly different ways of viewing the fall and salvation through Jesus. You can see the different views below.\nCatholicism.\nCatholicism believes that people are born sinful, but have free will, and so they can clean themselves of their sin and can get into Heaven after the grace of God has changed them so that they want to do that; without this \"first grace\" the sinful people do not want to \"go to Heaven\".\nCalvinism and Puritanism.\nCalvinists believe that God chooses the humans who were going to go to Heaven and those who were not. Humans do not get a choice in \"spiritual matters\".\nPuritans took this one step farther. Puritans said that humans could do nothing to be able to get to Heaven. They said that no matter how good a person was, if he had not been chosen by God at birth, he would not go to Heaven. However, one could lose the right to go to Heaven by being bad.\nProtestants believe that when Jesus sacrificed himself, he made man free from sin forever. Other people believe that when Jesus sacrificed himself, man was free from sin but he was not certain that he would still get into Heaven.\nLiberal Christianity.\nSome Christians say that the story of The Fall in Genesis 3 never happened but is just a myth or story that the Israelite people used to show that the relationship that man had with God is gone.\nThis view is quite neutral towards history. It says Bible stories that man failed in the Garden of Eden and needed to be saved are explanations of deeper spiritual truths. Some also say that Jesus Christ was God trying to start a new relationship with man.\nEastern Orthodox.\nEastern Orthodoxy believes that a son is not guilty of the sins of his father (so sin is not passed down from Adam). They believe that men and women are forced to sin because of the world around them and thy have to try and resist if they want to go to Heaven. But they still believe that Adam caused all humanity to have to work for this. The emphasis on free will is great: even the sinful people can be saved through synergy\u00a0with God's grace.\nPelagianism.\nPelagianism says that humans are capable of freely choosing good or bad decisions without God's help and that humans are not born with Adam's sin.\nMormonism.\nMormonism believes that The Fall was part of a plan thought up by God so that His children could get into Heaven.\nMormons say that when Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge it was not wrong, but was just a \"demotion\", like going from one good job to another, less good job. A step down but progressing in a forward direction. Mormons refer to The Fall as a Transgression. For Mormons a sin is the act of doing something contrary to the known will of God and to do so willing with full knowledge. Transgression, on the other hand, is the violation of a law or rule. So for Mormons, all sins (willfully disobedience) are transgressions but not all transgressions (violations) are sins. Since Adam didn\u2019t have knowledge of good and evil before partaking of the forbidden fruit, so his act was a transgression of the law, not a sin against the law.\nBefore eating the fruit, Adam could never die. Because he could never die, he could never go to heaven. Eating the fruit made it so that Adam could die, so that later he could go to heaven. It also made it so that Adam and Eve could have children, so that everyone would have a chance to live, die, and go to heaven. Mormons say that if one follows the Plan of Salvation, that person can go to heaven. Mormons believe that:\nUnification Church.\nUnification Church believe that Adam and Eve had sexual relations before they were married, and so they got thrown out of the Garden of Eden. They believe that a Blessing Ceremony can \"wash\" this sin away.\nUnity Church.\nThe Unity church believes that \"The Fall of Man\" has an important meaning but that it is not a true historic event.\nUnitarian Universalism.\nUnitarian Universalists believe that people are inherently good, and that it is their most precious gift, free will, that allows people to sometimes act wrongly, rather than predestination or external temptation. The Fall is story, metaphor, allegory, not a history. \nThe Fall in books.\nPhilip Pullman wrote a series called \"His Dark Materials\" and he says in the book that The Fall was a good thing. It was when humans became free to learn. Pullman believes that it is not worth being innocent if the price is not knowing the truth.\nC.S. Lewis wrote a book called \"Perelandra\" where Adam and Eve were on the planet Venus rather than the classic Garden of Eden.\nAlbert Camus wrote a book called \"The Fall\" where a man tells another man in a bar in Amsterdam called \"Mexico City\" why he did not want to rescue a man who was trying to kill himself by jumping off a bridge into a canal.\nIn the manga (or comic-book) \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", The Fall is often talked about, and at the end, an attempt to clean Adam's sin is performed and a new genesis is started."}

It formed in the southwestern part of the Caribbean Sea on October 26 and made landfall on the eastern coast of Nicaragua on October 30 as a strong Category 2 hurricane. Although Beta did create a lot of damage, it was somehow less than originally expected.\nStorm history.\nLate on October 26, a broad area of low pressure in the southwestern part of the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Costa Rica developed and became Tropical Depression Twenty-Six. At the second full advisory six hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beta. Beta strengthened into a hurricane at 2 am EDT October 29, after spending a few hours on the border between tropical storm and hurricane strength. Beta reached maximum windspeeds of 115 mph (185\u00a0km/h) making it a Category 3 hurricane by 4 am EST October 30. The Colombian island of Providencia, about 140 miles off the coast of Nicaragua, was in danger to hurricane force winds for several hours as the center of the storm moved slowly very close to the island. Original reports stated major damages to homes and a temporary loss of communications with the islanders.\nBeta made landfall in the morning of October 30 near the town of Sandy Bay Sirpi, 310 kilometres northeast of the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, as a strong Category 2 hurricane, destroying many buildings and knocking down trees. It weakened as it moved onto land and dissipated into a remnant low pressure system. If the system continued to move westward, the remnant low could have probably re-strengthened after it entered the Pacific Ocean. If the storm had regenerated, a new number and name would have been given.\nThe remnants of Hurricane Beta poured heavy rain over parts of the Central America on Monday, making forecasters to warn of deadly landslides and flooding as the storm began to dissipate. There were numerous reports of damage but fortunately no deaths were reported, although there were several reports of injuries and people missing. The storm finally dissipated late in the evening of October 30. Although Beta had moved out to sea, several rain bands from the remnant continued to fall on Nicaragua and Honduras on October 31.\nNicaraguan government officials said that if the hurricane had hit larger coastal cities such as Puerto Cabezas or Bluefields as was first predicted, it would have been a disaster. Hurricane Beta was the first hurricane to be named after a letter in the Greek alphabet, because the first tropical system to be named with a Greek letter, Tropical Storm Alpha, did not reach hurricane strength.\nPreparations.\nIn Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, local officials announced a curfew to help stop looting and worked to cut off electricity throughout the city to stop possible injuries. 60,000 people were moved into shelters. Thousands of residents striggled through heavy rain to reach shelters. Many experts, including national meteorology director Milagros Castro, warned of the threat of mudslides, especially since Beta was a slow-moving storm.\nIn Honduras, the government also kept a red alert for the storm and an emergency committee was working on moving 150,000 people from areas of the capital, Tegucigalpa, that would be in danger to flooding and mudslides. Evacuations were being readied in five of the country's eighteen departments. Civil defense officials have declared an alert in neighboring El Salvador, fearing the threat of mudslides after Hurricane Stan destroyed much of the area. The preparations eventually turned out to be very serious, since there was no deaths reported in spie of the large damages.\nImpact.\nProvidencia.\nOn the island of Providencia, roofs were ripped off from dozens of wooden homes, the island's main communications tower was knocked over and a tourist footbridge was destroyed. But most of the 5,000 islanders stayed safe by climbing Providencia's many hills to ride out the storm in brick shelters. At least thirty people are reported to have been injured during Hurricane Beta's destruction upon the island.\nNicaragua.\nBeta wiped out most of the town of Sandy Bay as it made landfall. Local reports said the town's population of 3,000 had mostly evacuated in advance. Wooden huts made most of the housing in Sandy Bay, and about eighty percent of it was thought to be uninhabitable. Trees were knocked down and roofs were ripped off from houses during Hurricane Beta's attack on the country. At least one pier was damaged. Many herds of cattle were killed by the storm. 700 people were trapped in Tasbapauni, a town separated from the mainland by a lagoon. Eighty percent of homes in Tasbapauni are thought to be damaged very badly. Some 200 homes in Laguna de Perlas' seventeen lake-front villages are reported to have been damaged a lot. \nThough the storm's remnants were expected to drop an additional four to eight inches on the already water logged ground, President Enrique Bola\u00f1os said his country had escaped a major disaster. He promised to quickly get aid to separated towns cut off by flooding and landslides. Nicaraguan Civil Defence Chief Col. Mario Perez Cassar said eighty per cent of the buildings on the central coast where the hurricane hit were heavily damaged or destroyed.\nOne person was reported to be injured and four people were reported missing in Nicaragua. The four missing men were later found alive on a boat that had been swept out into the Caribbean. A passing Panamanian-registered tanker ship found the four, all Miskito Indians, adrift about forty eight kilometres off the Nicaraguan coast after their gasoline ran out.\nHonduras.\nIn Honduras, Beta left fifty communities separated and broke bridges in the northeastern provinces of Gracias a Dios, Atlantida and Colon on the coast. Strong winds knocked down signs, fences, trees and electricity and telephone poles, cutting off power and communication in hundreds of communities and at least two highways were blocked.\nAuthorities evacuated more than 7,800 people from north of the Nicaraguan border after four rivers overflowed from rain caused by Beta. The national soccer league stopped all of its games. The airports at La Ceiba and Roatan on the coast were operating intermittenly because of poor visibility, strong winds and flooding. Flooding damaged rice, corn and bean fields. High waters also sent snakes out of the jungle into urban areas, although there were no reports of snakebites."}

It was first performed on 14 February 1895 at St. James's Theatre in London. In the play, the protagonists make up people who are not real to try to make their lives easier. The play's most important themes are the light humourous way it treats serious things like marriages and the satire of Victorian ways. At the time the play came out, reviews all praised the play's humour. However, some people wanted better social messages, while others thought that it was the best play Wilde had ever written. It is Wilde's most popular play.\nThe plot is about two men who try to woo their respective lovers by convincing each that their name is Ernest. The play includes many puns and plays on words. Even the title is a pun, because \"Ernest\" is a man's name and \"earnest\" is a word that means \"serious, honest, and sincere.\" The play is about morality, style, and hypocrisy, among others, but it is noted for being humorous and lighthearted.\nThe successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, father of Lord Alfred Douglas, Wilde's lover, planned to present Wilde a bouquet of spoiling vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off, and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards the feud came to a climax in court, and Wilde's new notoriety caused the play, despite its success, to be closed after just 86 performances. After imprisonment, he wrote no further comic or dramatic work. \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" has been revived many times since its premiere and adapted for the cinema on three occasions, in 1952, 1992 and 2002.\nCritical reception.\nUnlike many other plays at this time, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\"'s light story was not about serious social or political issues. This was something that reviewers at that time were not sure what to think about. Though they were not sure of how serious Wilde was, they agreed that the play was clever, funny, and popular. George Bernard Shaw, for example, reviewed the play in the \"Saturday Review\". He said that comedy plays should not only be funny but touching, saying, \"I go to the theatre to be \"moved\" to laughter\". Later in a letter he said that the play was \"extremely funny\" but \"really heartless\".\nOpera and radio.\nIn 1963, Erik Chisholm made an opera from the play.\nBBC Radio 4 made a radio adaptation on 13 February 1995. It was directed by Glyn Dearman. Dame Judi Dench was \"Lady Bracknell\", Sir Michael Hordern was \"Lane\", Michael Sheen was \"Jack Worthing\", Martin Clunes was \"Algernon Moncrieff\", John Moffatt was \"Rev. Canon Chasuble\", Miriam Margolyes was \"Miss Prism\", Samantha Bond was \"Gwendolen\" and Amanda Root was \"Cecily\". The production came out on audio cassette by Hodder Headline Audiobooks with BBC Enterprises ().\nOn 13 December 2000, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a new radio adaptation directed by Howard Davies. In this radio adaption, Geraldine McEwan was \"Lady Bracknell\", Simon Russell Beale was \"Jack Worthing\", Julian Wadham was \"Algernon Moncrieff\", Geoffrey Palmer was \"Rev.

It formed very late during the year on December 30, after the official end of the season, and was a very rare tropical cyclone to live during two calendar years.\nTropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30 in the central Atlantic Ocean, where it stayed far away from land during its whole lifetime. While every forecast given to the storm predicted it to dissipate quickly, Zeta, like Hurricane Epsilon, denied those advisories. Zeta reached to its maximum strength on January 2 until finally dissipating on January 8, also bringing the close to the end of the 2005 season.\nStorm history.\nLate on December 29, 2005, a tropical depression developed in the east-central Atlantic Ocean from a frontal trough and strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day. As this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season, the National Hurricane Center did not actually classify the system until after it had already become a tropical storm. The new bound storm originally moved to the northwest but stopped for a few hous late on December 31 before moving west. As Tropical Storm Zeta slowly gained strength, it had many characteristics similar to Hurricane Epsilon, like when the National Hurricane Center constantly forecasted that Zeta would weaken because of the high wind shear; but Zeta still held onto its strength, like Epsilon had done.\nTropical Storm Zeta weakened a little bit on January 2, before strengthening again to its maximum strength with 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) winds on the same day. One of the models suggested that Zeta could strengthen further and become a hurricane but this did not happen. Tropical Storm Zeta continued to reject forecasts of weakening and on January 4, so much frustration made NHC forecaster, Dr. Lixion Avila to say that he had \"run out of things to say\".\nThe effects huge amount of wind shear finally began to affect the storm itself on January 4, as Zeta's strength began to weaken. This made Tropical Storm Zeta to weaken into a very weak tropical storm. The NHC still continued to overestimate how fast Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they actually downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been wrong. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day, finally bringing an end to the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. But the remnant low still its identity for one more day before it dissipated 660 miles (1060 km) southeast of Bermuda.\nImpact.\nSeveral of the people that were taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong, unpleasant winds from Tropical Storm Zeta. The ship \"Liberty Star\" made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) winds early on December 31, when the ship was about 45\u00a0miles (75\u00a0km) north from the center of the storm. Because Tropical Storm Zeta never came close to land, no coastal watches or warnings were given out. There were no reports of damages or deaths from Zeta.\nNaming and records.\nWhen Tropical Storm Zeta formed at 0600 UTC on December 31, it became the second latest-forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, forming about six hours earlier than Hurricane Alice did in 1954. Zeta is only the second Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to have lived through two calendar years (after Alice). Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty-eight, seven more than the previous record held by a hurricane season from 1933. It was also the only Atlantic storm to have a name beginning with the letter \"Z\", since the list of names for Atlantic storms do not have a \"Z\" name."}

It will turn more bitter tasting in hot weather. You can grow lettuce during winter in a greenhouse.\nEating lettuce.\nIn some countries, it is often eaten cold and raw, in salads, hamburgers, tacos, sandwichs, and many other dishes. In some places, including China, lettuce is eaten cooked. Lettuce contains very little energy or nutrients.\nKinds of lettuce.\nMost lettuce leaves are green, but some are red. Most lettuce leaves taste bitter. Some kinds of lettuce grow in a head shape like cabbage, while the leaves of some kinds grow more loosely.\nThe five main cultivars are: green leaf, red leaf, cos, crisphead, and stem lettuce. \nCommon varieties are Romaine, iceberg, and butter lettuce.\nThe name of the plant in English, \"lettuce,\" and in Latin, \"lactuca,\" come from \"lactis\", the Latin word for milk, because the juice of the plant looks like milk.\nHistory of lettuce.\nWild lettuce plants were eaten by the Romans and Egyptians. The ancient Greeks were among the first people to grow lettuce as a crop. It was one of the first plants brought to the New World by Christopher Columbus."}

{"id": "65643", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65643", "title": "Ticino", "text": "Canton Ticino or Ticino ([]; French and German: \"Tessin\" [] and []) is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. The written language is Italian in almost the entire canton (except the Walser municipality of Bosco Gurin, where it is German). It surrounds the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia. Together with areas of the canton of Graub\u00fcnden it makes up the so-called \"Svizzera Italiana\" (Italian Switzerland). Lombard dialects (Ticinese) are still spoken, especially in the valleys, but they have no official status. It is named after the Ticino river.\nGeography.\nThe canton of Ticino is located in the south of Switzerland. It is almost entirely surrounded by Italy which lies to its east, west and south. To the north lie the cantons of Valais and Uri, to the northeast the canton of Graub\u00fcnden.\nIts area is 2,812\u00a0km\u00b2, of which about three quarters are considered productive. Forests cover about a third of the area, but also the lakes Maggiore and Lugano make up a considerable part of the total area. These lakes are known with the above listed names, but are officially named Lake Verbano and Lake Ceresio.\nThe canton is split geographically in two parts by the Monte Ceneri pass. The northern, more mountainous part, called \"Sopraceneri\", is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around the lake Maggiore: Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley. The southern part, called \"Sottoceneri\", is the region around the Lake Lugano.\nThe River Ticino is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the Bedretto Valley and the Leventina valley to enter Lake Maggiore near Locarno. Its main tributaries are the Brenno in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in Graub\u00fcnden. The lands of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the \"Riviera\".\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the Maggia River. The Verzasca Valley is located between the Ticino river and the Maggia river. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the Lake Lugano. Most of the land is considered within the Alps, but a small area is part of the plain of the River Po which drains the north of Italy.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times the area of what is today Ticino was settled by the Lepontii, a Celtic tribe. Later, probably around the rule of Augustus, it became part of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the Western Empire, was ruled by the Ostrogoths, the Lombards and the Franks. Around 1100 CE it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of Milan and Como: in the 14th century it was definitively acquired by the Visconti, Dukes of Milan. In the 15th century the Swiss Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\nThe Canton of Uri conquered the Leventina Valley in 1440. Between 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from Uri, but subsequently lost. In a second conquest Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden gained the town of Bellinzona and the Riviera in 1500. Some of the land and the town Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by Uri in 1419 but lost again in 1422. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In 1512 Locarno, the Maggia Valley, Lugano and Mendrisio were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the Ticino River, from the St. Gotthard to the town of Biasca (Leventina Valley) was part of Canton Uri. The remaining territory (\"Baliaggi Ultramontani\", \"Ennetbergische Vogteien\", the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons.\nThe lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the Swiss Confederation. (After the battle of Marignano in 1515 the king of France Francis I defeated the Confederates, and they gave up any further conquests.) In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the Cisalpine Republic was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano. Between 1798 and 1803, during the Helvetic Republic, the districts of Bellinzona and Lugano were separate cantons, but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year. During the Napoleonic Wars, many Ticinese (as was the case for other Swiss) served in Swiss military units allied with the French.\nUntil 1878 the three largest cities, Bellinzona, Lugano and Locarno, alternated as capital of the canton. In 1878, however, Bellinzona became the only and permanent capital.\nThe current constitution dates from 1997. The previous constitution, heavily modified, dates from 1830, nearly 20 years before the constitution of actual Swiss Confederation.\nGovernment.\nThe cantonal parliament is the \"Grand Council\" (Italian: \"Gran Consiglio\"), with 90 members and the government (\"Consiglio di Stato\") has 5 members (\"Consiglieri di Stato\"). In the both councils the members are elected with the proportional electoral system. The canton sends two deputies to the Swiss Council of States (upper house), and eight deputies to the National Council (lower house). It's regional capitol is Bellinzona.\nAgriculture.\nThe main agricultural production is wine, mostly merlot, a type of red wine. It is followed by horticulture, milk and cheese production.\nEconomy.\nThe hilly slopes of the canton are used extensively for the production of hydroelectricity. The electricity produced is used at home and sold for export. There is cattle breeding in the northern areas. The production of wine is important in the canton and exported to mainly other areas in Switzerland. The vineyards are mostly concentrated in the southern half of the canton where the climate is warmer. Other agricultural produce includes corn (maize), potatoes, tobacco and vegetables.\nThe weather in the canton is often inverse to that north of the Alps. This, and a warmer climate in general, attracts many tourists from other Swiss cantons. The lakes together with the sunshine are considered attractive. Tourism is the single most important economic factor in the canton.\nThere is also light industry, mostly concentrated around the three largest towns of Lugano, Locarno and Bellinzona.\nThe canton is well connected to the rest of Switzerland. There are tunnels underneath the Gotthard massive, both for rail and road. The canton of Grisons (Graub\u00fcnden) is connected with a direct coach link, whereas the canton of Valais is connected by rail through a tunnel at the Simplon Pass. There are good rail links to Milan and Rome in Italy as well as Germany via Basel and Z\u00fcrich.\nBecause of the tourist trade there are a number of small railways in scenic areas in the mountains. Winter sports is important, despite being less developed.\nThere are two major centres of education and research located in the canton of Ticino. The University of Italian speaking Switzerland (USI, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana) is the only Swiss university teaching in Italian. The University of Applied Sciences of Italian speaking Switzerland (SUPSI, Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana) on the other hand is a professional training college focused on a practical method of teaching in the areas of applied art, economy, social work, technology and production science.\nThree daily newspapers are published in Ticino: Corriere del Ticino, La Regione, and Giornale del Popolo. These represent the only Italian daily publications in Switzerland.\nLanguage.\nThe official language, and the one used for most written communication, is Italian. In oral communication Western Lombard (Ticinese) varieties, although receding in favour of Italian (especially in the cities of Lugano, Ascona and Locarno and among the younger generations), are still well preserved. These are further subdivided into local variations, with the northern valleys speaking a dialect more closely aligned with Romansch, Switzerland's fourth official language. There is a certain amount of popular literature (poems, comedies, etc.) in Ticinese, and the national radio and televisions trasmit regularly program in Ticinese (mainly comedies).\nReligion.\nThe population is mostly Roman Catholic (75%) or Protestant (7%). About 2% each are Orthodox or Muslim.\nDistricts.\nThe Canton of Ticino is divided into 8 districts (\"distretti\") and 38 circles (\"circoli\"):\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 195 municipalities in the canton (as of February 2006). These municipalities (\"comuni\") are grouped in 38 \"circoli\" (circles or sub-districts) which are in turn grouped into districts (\"distretti\"). Since late 1990 there is an ongoing project of group some municipalities together (as they are small)."}

It has a drainage area of 71,000\u00a0km\u00b2 and is the longest river in Italy. \nIt goes through many important Italian towns, including Turin (Torino) and (indirectly) Milan (Milano), in Lombardy. It is connected to Milan through a net of channels called \"navigli\", which Leonardo da Vinci helped design. Near the end of its course, it creates a wide delta (with hundreds of small channels and five main ones, called \"Po di Maestra\", \"Po della Pila\", \"Po delle Tolle\", \"Po di Gnocca\" and \"Po di Goro\") at the southern part of which is Comacchio, an area famous for eels. The Po valley corresponds to the Roman Cisalpine Gaul, divided in Cispadane Gaul (South of the Po) and Transpadane Gaul (North of the Po).\nThe vast valley around the Po is called \"Pianura Padana\" and is so efficiently connected by the river that the whole valley became the main industrial area of the country. This river is subject to the authority of a special authority, the \"Magistrato delle Acque\".\nRoman poets sometimes referred to the Po river as Eridanus, which also has other meanings.\nThe main products of the farms around the river are cereals.\nIn 2005, water from the Po was found to contain \"staggering\" amounts of benzoylecgonine, which is excreted by cocaine users in urine. Based on these figures, cocaine consumption was estimated to be about 4\u00a0kg daily, or 27 doses per day per thousand young adults in areas that feed into the river\u2014a number nearly three times higher than previous estimates.

His performance impressed the United players, who told Ferguson to sign him.\nManchester United.\nOn 12 August 2003, Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting CP for a fee of \u00a312.24 million. He was Manchester United's first Portuguese player. He wanted the number 28, the number he wore at Sporting, but was eventually given the number 7. This number had been worn by George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham before him. He played his first game for the club on 16 August 2003 in a 4-0 win against Bolton Wanderers.

Ronaldo also won his second Ballon d'Or in 2013.\nIn the 2013-14 season, Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in one Champions League season by scoring his 17th goal with a penalty in extra time in the final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid that Real Madrid won 4\u20131. The previous record was 14 goals, set by Messi in the 2011-12 season. \nIn the 2014-15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal record by scoring 61 goals in all competitions. This achievement helped him win his second Ballon d'Or. He scored five goals in one match for the first time in his career in a 9-1 win vs. Granada on 5 April 2015. He became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer when he scored 5 goals against RCD Espanyol in a 6-0 away win on 12 September 2015. This brought his total goal tally to 230 goals in 203 games. The previous record holder was Raul.\nOn 18 April 2017, he became the first player to reach 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League, after he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 extra-time win against Bayern Munich. On 18 March 2018, Ronaldo reached his 50th career hat-trick in a 6-3 win against Girona. Ronaldo scored an amazing bicycle-kick in a UEFA Champions League match against Juventus on 3 April 2018. He got a standing ovation, or round of applause, from the Juventus fans after scoring that goal. Real Madrid went on to play the final against Liverpool F.C.. Real Madrid became champions, so that was Ronaldo's 5th Champions League.\nJuventus.\nOn 10 July 2018, He joined Juventus of Italy and signed a 4 year contract worth 112 Million Euros. The transfer was the highest paid for a player over 30 years old. People called it \"the deal of the century\".\nHe scored his first goals for the club on 16 September against US Sassuolo. Juventus won 2-1 at home. Three days later, on 19 September, he was controversially sent off against Valencia C.F. for \"violent behavior\". He was crying as he received the red card and said he \"did nothing\". Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, in January 2019. In the match, he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.\nReturn to Manchester United.\nOn 31 August 2021, Ronaldo returned to Manchester United and the Premier League.\nInternational Career.\nYouth.\nRonaldo began his international career with the Portugal under-15's in 2001. In 2002, he played the U-17 Euro with Portugal's U-17. In June 2003, Ronaldo won the Toulon Tournament with the Portugal U-20. He played with the U21's in 2003 as well during the 2004 U-21 Euro qualification stages. He also played with the Portugal under-23 team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he scored one goal against Morocco. \nSenior.\nHe kept progressing through the youth national teams until he played his first senior game for Portugal when he was 18 on 20 August 2003 against Kazakhstan. He scored his first goal for Portugal in a game against Greece at the UEFA Euro 2004. \nRonaldo was selected to play at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was also his first World Cup. During the tournament, he scored a goal against Iran. That goal was also his first World Cup goal. In the match against England, Ronaldo's teammate at Manchester United, Wayne Rooney, was sent off. Ronaldo went up to the referee and appeared to ask the ref to give a red card to Rooney. Rooney pushed Ronaldo as he was talking to the ref. After Rooney left the pitch, Ronaldo was caught on camera winking at the Portugal bench. Even though the referee said Rooney would've gotten the red card if Ronaldo complained or not, these actions caused a lot of fans to hate Ronaldo because they believed he influenced the referee's decision. \nRonaldo became captain of Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007. At Euro 2008, he scored one goal against Czech Republic. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals by barely losing to Germany 3-2. In the 2010 World Cup, Ronaldo only scored one goal in a 7-0 win against North Korea, but was the man of the match in all of Portugal's 3 group stage games. Portugal were eliminated in the round of 16 by Spain 1-0, and Spain went on to win the World Cup. \nHis first international hat-trick came in a 4-2 win against Northern Ireland on 6 September 2013. In that match, he scored 3 goals in 15 minutes. He became Portugal's all time top scorer when he scored twice against Cameroon in March 2014, with Portugal winning 5-1. At the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a goal against Ghana, and assisted a last minute equalizer in a 2-2 draw against the United States. In a 3-3 draw against Hungary in Euro 2016, Ronaldo scored a back heel goal. This goal made him the first player to score in four Euros. Although he had to leave the game early because he got injured in the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, Portugal still won 1-0 in extra time because of a goal from Eder. \nIn the 2018 World Cup held in Russia, Ronaldo scored 4 goals. In Portugal's first group game, he scored a hat trick against Spain in a 3-3 draw. After that he scored the winning goal against Morocco. In the last group game, he missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw against Iran. Portugal qualified to the knockout stages by finishing second in the group. They were eliminated by Uruguay 2-1. Ronaldo became one of only four players to score at 4 World Cups. He has played at 4 of them: 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018.\nIn June 2019, Ronaldo won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal to give him his second international title. In the final, Portugal beat The Netherlands 1-0.\nPlaying Style.\nRonaldo is able to play on both wings and also as a striker since he is very strong with both feet, even though he is naturally right footed. He is also one of the world's fastest players. He has good heading ability because he is over 6 feet tall and jumps high. He is also known for his powerful \"knuckleball\" free kicks. The \"knuckleball\" technique is when the ball spins very little and creates an unpredictable motion. He combines this with his powerful shot, making it hard for goalkeepers to stop his shots. Ronaldo has also been known for his dribbling, as he likes to do many tricks and with the ball to pass defenders, such as the . When he was at Manchester United, he would play as a winger and try to send into the middle. At Real Madrid, he changed his playing style by moving more towards the middle and becoming more of a striker. He also focused more on scoring goals. When he arrived to Juventus, he stayed with this playing style of being a goal scorer and target man, although he dribbled with the ball more because he sometimes liked to play his traditional winger position and go one-on-one with defenders. He also sent crosses more frequently than he did in his last few seasons at Real Madrid.\nReception.\nRonaldo has been criticized for \"diving\" by many people, including his Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.He has also been criticized for being arrogant, such as complaining for not receiving set-pieces (free-kicks and penalties) when he gets fouled, having too much self-confidence, not celebrating with teammates after scoring goals, and getting excessively angry with others after losing. Examples of this are when he threw a reporter's microphone into a lake before a UEFA Euro 2016 match, and negative comments made at the Iceland national team after playing against them.\nPersonal Life.\nRonaldo's father, Jos\u00e9 Aveiro, died of liver disease at age 52 in September 2005. Ronaldo was 20 years old at the time. Ronaldo said that he does not like to drink alcohol, mostly because of his dad's death, but has on some very few occasions.\nIn 2006, Ronaldo opened his first fashion boutique under the name \"CR7\" (his initials and shirt number) on the\u00a0island he was born in, Madeira. He opened a second boutique in Lisbon in 2008, and a third in 2009, located in Madrid. In December 2013, Ronaldo opened his own museum called \"Museu CR7\", which has all of his trophies and awards from his career.\nRonaldo became a father on 17 June 2010. He had a son, named Cristiano Jr.\u00a0He was born in the United States through an American surrogate he met in a restaurant, and Ronaldo announced that he had full custody.\u00a0Ronaldo has never publicly revealed information about his son's mother, but he says he will reveal it to Cristiano Jr. when he gets older. On 8 June 2017, Ronaldo confirmed on social media that he had become the father to twins, Mateo and Eva. They were born in the United States to a mother. In November 2017, his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez gave birth to their first daughter, Alana.\nRonaldo has had many relationships. He was in a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk from 2010\u20132015. In 2016, he began to date Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez. They were publicly seen for the first time at Disneyland Paris in November 2016.\nRonaldo is a\u00a0Roman Catholic. He does not have\u00a0tattoos\u00a0because it would prevent him from donating blood. On 9 November 2015, a movie about his lifestyle and his career was released. The title of the movie is \"Ronaldo\". \nOn 29 March 2017, Madeira Airport was renamed to Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. A bust of Ronaldo was also revealed as part of the official renaming ceremony.\nHe is currently the most followed Instagram user, with over 200 million followers as of February 2020. He passed Selena Gomez as the most followed person in October 2018, with 144 million followers.\nLegal Issues.\nIn June 2018, Ronaldo was given a suspended jail sentence of 2 years and a fine of \u20ac18.8 million for tax evasion.\nIn 2017, a woman claimed she was raped by Ronaldo at a hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009. Many articles state that Ronaldo and the woman both met each other at the nightclub of the hotel. Ronaldo later invited her to his suite, and that was where the rape occurred. Ronaldo paid that woman $375,000 to stay quiet, and an agreement was made between Ronaldo's lawyers and the woman's lawyers that if she publicly shared information of what happened, she had to pay those $375,000 back. Ronaldo himself denies raping the woman and calls it \"fake news\". In July 2019, prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo because there was not enough evidence."}

{"id": "65670", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65670", "title": "Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany", "text": "The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany is the name of Germany's constitution. It was written in 1949 when Germany was split into the countries of East Germany and West Germany. Many parts of the constitution are very different from the constitution of the Weimar Republic.\nThe writers decided not to call it the constitution because they hoped it would only be a temporary law for West Germany and that the two Germanys would soon be made into one.\nIt was more than 40 years before East Germany and West Germany became one country again, but the old name of Basic Law has been kept.\nProtecting the Constitution.\nThe Federal Constiutional Court (German: Bundesverfassungsgericht) protects the constitution by banning laws which break the constitution. There are \"eternal clauses\" in the constitution which the court will protect even by banning \"constitutional amendments\" (laws to change them). Article 1, about human life and dignity, and article 20's basic principles are protected from change. This is to make sure nothing like the Nazi period happens again. The Nazis were able to pass an Enabling Act which allowed Hitler to rule by decree.\nThe Five Constitutional Bodies.\nGermany is a federal parliamentary democracy. To show this there are five \"constitutional institutions\".\nPresidency.\nThe Federal President () is the head of state. It is largely ceremonial position with only a small role in daily politics. The president does not have the massive power of the president of the Weimar Republic, or the President of the United States. He is the formal head of state, and signs laws before they can enter into force and appoints federal officials, he cannot decide when to dissolve the Bundestag or name a new chancellor until a majority of the members of the parliament () vote in favour.\nExecutive branch.\nThe Chancellor is chosen by the Bundestag. He or she is head of the executive branch, and heads the federal Cabinet.\nJudicial branch.\nThe Judicial branch is made up of the Federal Constitutional Court and five other Supreme Courts. There are also local and regional courts which make the first decision about cases. Their decisions can be overturnned by the courts of appeal or Supreme Courts.\nFederal Constitutional Court.\nThe Federal Constitutional Court is the most important court in Germany. Its job is to protect the Basic Law. Its decisions are like laws. The court can cancel laws if they break the Basic Law. \nFederal Social Court.\nThe Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about social security, pensions and health insurance\nFederal Labour Court.\nThe Federal Labour Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about labour law. This includes contracts of employment, strikes and trade union agreements\nFederal Tax Court.\nThe Federal Tax Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases about tax and customs law\nFederal Administrative Court.\nThe Federal Social Court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases involving a government body. These may be because a person might feel they have been treated unfairly by government or because there is a dispute between two government bodies about which of them is allowed to do something.\nFederal Supreme Court.\nThis court is the Supreme Court of Appeal for cases all civil and criminal cases which are not heard by one of the other supreme courts\nLegislative branch.\nThe legislative branch has two of the constitutional bodies.\nBundesrat.\nGermany's upper chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat, represents the \"L\u00e4nder\". It also shows that Germany is a federal state. Federalism is one of the \"eternal clauses\" of the constitution, that can never be changed..\nBundestag.\nThe Bundestag is the part of the legislature chosen by election. The Chancellor must be a member of the Bundestag.\nOther stipulations.\nThe military.\nThe Weimar Constitution had the Reichswehr outside of the control of the parliament or the public. The army directly reported to the president, and the president did not have to report to the parliament. \nUnder the Basic Law, the Defence Forces Bundeswehr are responsible to parliament, because \nThe chancellor is directly responsible to the parliament, the minister is indirectly responsible to the parliament because it can remove the government by electing a new chancellor.\nThe Basic Law also created a soldiers' ombudsman or \"Wehrbeauftragter\", reporting to parliament not to the government. Soldiers can write directly to the \"Wehrbeauftragter\" if they feel they have been treated unfairly or unlawfully, or if they think their commanders are acting illegally. Soldiers cannot be punished for writing to the \"Wehrbeauftragter\".\nA number of Constitutional Court cases in the 1990s said that the Bundeswehr cannot be used by the government outside NATO territory unless the Bundestag first gives permission in a resolution. The resultion must describe where the Bundeswehr is to go, and for who long the mission will last.\nReferendums and plebiscites.\nThe Basic Law only allows referendums about changing borders of the \"L\u00e4nder\". There have been two referundums:\nDevelopment of the Basic Law since 1949.\nImportant changes to the Basic Law were the re-introduction of conscription and the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1956.\nDuring reunification East Germany and West Germany decided not to write a new constitution, but to keep the old one, which had worked so well in West Germany. The constitution was amended to allow East Germany to join, and then changed again to strengthen the claim that Germany wanted no more territory. This was a promise made in the Final Settlement."}

Many species are endangered.\nEmbryology.\nThe nine-banded armadillo has an unusual reproductive system, in which genetically identical quadruplets are born in each litter.\nBecause they are always genetically identical clones, the group of four young is a good subject for scientific, behavioural or medical tests. They provide the same biological and genetic makeup, and then get different treatment. This is the only regular case of 'polyembryony' in the class Mammalia, where one fertilised egg splits into four embryos. It only happens in the genus Dasypus, and not in all armadillos.

It is Vitamin B3. It can be dissolved in water. It plays a very important role in the metabolism of living cells. \nOther functions of niacin include removing toxic chemicals from the body, and helping with the production of steroid hormones made by the adrenal gland. These hormones include sex hormones and stress-related ones. \nHistory.\nNiacin was first discovered from the oxidation of nicotine to form nicotinic acid. When the properties of nicotinic acid were discovered, it was thought prudent to choose a name to dissociate it from nicotine, in order to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contain nicotine. The resulting name 'niacin' was made from nicotinic acid + vitamin. \nNiacin is also referred to as Vitamin B3 because it was the third of the B vitamins to be discovered. It has historically been referred to as \"vitamin PP\". That name was derived from the term \"pellagra-preventing factor\", because the disease pellagra is due to a deficiency of niacin in the diet.\nHow much Niacin is needed.\nThe recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2\u201312\u00a0mg a day for children, 14\u00a0mg a day for women, 16\u00a0mg a day for men, and 18\u00a0mg a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women. \nSevere deficiency of niacin in the diet causes the disease pellagra. A mild deficiency will slow down the metabolism, causing decreased tolerance to cold. \nDietary niacin deficiency tends to occur only in areas where people eat corn (maize), the only grain low in niacin, as a staple food, \"and\" that do not use lime during meal/flour production. Alkali lime releases the tryptophan from the corn in a process called nixtamalization so that it can be absorbed in the intestine, and converted to niacin."}

A remix version featuring rapper Lil' Mama was released in June 2007.\n\"Girlfriend\" was the subject of a lawsuit filed by songwriters for The Rubinoos, who alleged that the writers of the song copied The Rubinoos' single \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". Only one line, not even of the same tune was: \"Hey, hey, you, you! I want to be your girlfriend!\" Note it was \"I want to\" not \"I wanna\".\nThe music video became the second most viewed video of all time on YouTube, currently having over 100,000,000 views. In the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, it is nominated for the category Monster Single of the Year."}

He is famous for having been the conductor of the Proms. He conducted the Proms for 50 years. They became known as the \"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\". Today they are called the \"BBC Proms\".\nHis life.\nHenry Wood was born in London. His father was an optician, but had become well known for making model trains. He sold them in his shop in Oxford Street in London. His parents liked music. They both sang and his father played the cello.\nAlthough Henry heard a lot of music around him he did not have proper music lessons until he was already quite old. When he was 14 he learned to play the organ. He also played the piano and violin. When he was 16 he went to the Royal Academy of Music where he had lessons in piano, organ, composition and singing. He wanted to become a singing teacher, and he did in fact give singing lessons all his life. He became good at the piano so that he could accompany singers.\nWhen he left the Royal Academy of Music he found work as a singing teacher and as a conductor of choirs and orchestras. He wrote a small book called \"The Gentle Art of Singing\".\nPromenade Concerts.\nIn 1893 a man called Robert Newman, who was manager of the Queen's Hall, had an idea. He wanted to organize a series of concerts in which the audience could walk about and listen to music. He wanted to call them \"Promenade Concerts\" (the word comes from the French \"se promener\" = \"to walk\"). There were already promenade concerts in the parks in London, but those Promenade concerts were just for music that was easy to listen to. Newman wanted people to get to know good classical music. He wanted the tickets to be cheap so that people who were not rich would be able to afford to go. Newman thought that Henry Wood was a good conductor and asked him to conduct these concerts.\nThe first series of Promenade Concerts (or \"Proms\" for short) was in 1895. The programmes were much longer than they are in concerts today. There were lots of short pieces of music. Wood gradually made his audiences get used to listening to longer pieces of music. He introduced them to new music which had only recently been written. He conducted music by many British composers and European composers. People at that time were very prejudiced. They thought that only German conductors knew how to conduct German composers such as Richard Wagner. Wood showed them that he could do it too. He conducted every night during the Proms season. On Mondays he played a lot of Wagner and on Fridays he played Beethoven. He played music by European composers whose music was not yet well known in England, e.g. Sibelius, Schoenberg and many Russian composers.\nWood conducted the Proms until his death in 1944. Most of that time he was the only conductor of the Proms. Later in life he shared the conducting with other conductors such as Basil Cameron and Sir Adrian Boult. Wood had a big influence on the standard of music making in England. He made orchestral playing better, making sure that the players did not send in deputies instead of them. He made sure that the orchestral players were paid well and he allowed women to play in the orchestra.\nOther musical activities.\nWood is mainly remembered for the promenade concerts, but he conducted many other groups as well. He travelled around England, conducting at music festivals. He often conducted amateur groups. He made sure that he knew the music he was conducting very well. Many conductors in the 19th century did not do this. They were more keen to show off, but Wood prepared the music carefully, marking things in his score with coloured pencils.\nWood made arrangements of other composer's music, e.g. Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\" for organ. He arranged a group of songs called \"Fantasia on British Sea Songs\" for the 1905 centenary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar. These are always played at the Last Night of the Proms. \nIn 1938 he conducted a jubilee concert in the Royal Albert Hall. Rachmaninov was the soloist, and Vaughan Williams wrote his \"Serenade to Music\" for orchestra and sixteen soloists. Wood often worked too hard and it was not good for his health. He died on 19 August 1944, just over a week after the fiftieth anniversary concert of the Proms, which he had been too ill even to listen to on the radio. \nWood was given many honours: he was knighted by the king in 1911, he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1944. At the Proms today his bust is put at the front of the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season. At the Last Night of the Proms it is decorated by a chaplet."}

God favours every person, without looking at what they did or how much they are worth. This grace of God to humans may happen in the gifts that God gives him, such as creation or salvation.\nTypes of Grace.\nCommon Grace.\nCommon grace refers to blessings which God gives to everyone. Jesus said that God \"sends the rain upon the just and the unjust. This idea is found in Greek philosophy. Plato spoke of God's \"gifts\". The Reformers listed many ways in which God gives undeserved gifts to mankind. These include life itself, food and earthly pleasures. God also restrains evil so that people will not destroy themselves in wars and conflict.\nPrevenient Grace.\nPrevenient grace (or enabling grace) is a Christian teaching in Arminian theology. It appeared earlier in Catholic and early Anabaptist teaching. It is divine grace that goes before human decision. In other words, God will start showing special love to a person at a certain time of his life.\nPrevenient grace is taught by Christians who are influenced by the theology of Jacob Arminius or John Wesley. Wesleyan Arminians believe God helps people to accept the gift of salvation. \nSaving Grace.\nThis refers to the good things that God gives to those who believe in Jesus. The gifts include forgiveness of sin, eternal life, and the power to live a good and holy life.\nIn Popular Culture.\n\"Grace\" is a common girl's name in many countries.\n\"Amazing Grace\" is a song that became very popular. It is played at funerals, sometimes on a bagpipe. This song was written by John Newton who was an evil slave trader. His life was changed when he became a Christian. He later worked to stop the practice of slavery. His story is told in a 2006 movie."}

A proxy server that passes information to its clients without changing it is usually called a gateway or sometimes called \"tunneling proxy\".\nProxy servers get their name because they act like a proxy (a stand-in) and act on behalf of a Client's computer.\nA client that connects to the proxy server will ask for some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, that is available on a \"different\" server. The proxy server then goes to the \"other\" server and asks for what the client wants for them.\nA proxy server can change the information that it gives to the client, and if the same information is accessed many times or by many different clients it can use what is called a cache to make things faster. A cache is the term for information that has been accessed and saved for future use; if a proxy server has what the client is accessing in its cache, it will make it faster because it does not need to go and access the other server to provide what the client wants.\nA proxy server can be placed anywhere in the connection between the client and the server, which could include software on the client computer itself or on any computer between.\nSome proxy servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to secure the connection between the client and the remote server. This security layer helps to make sure that no other computers can read or understand what the client is asking from the server.\nBenefits of proxy servers.\nThere are many benefits of using a proxy server. First, the client machine can exchange data with the remote server without making a direct connection. This way, the client's real internet address will not be known to the remote server. This is sometimes called anonymitizing because it makes the client anonymous.\nA second advantage is that when the proxy server itself is able to serve the request made by the client, it will not contact the remote server any more. So the load on the remote server will be reduced by using a proxy server. This type of proxy servers are called \"caching servers\".\nBig organizations (or even countries) sometimes use proxy servers to control access to the Internet. A large bank may use a proxy server that only allows connections to other websites relevant to banking. The proxy server might however block access to Websites offering free email or serving pornographic material. It might also block access to file sharing applications. Limiting access to specific content on the internet is also called \"internet filtering\".\nTypes and functions.\nA proxy server may have one or more of the functions described below:\nCaching proxy server.\nA caching proxy server can service requests from clients, without contacting the remote server; instead, it sends the data which it has stored from a previous request. This is called caching.\nCaching proxy servers reduce the work load of the remote server. However, they have their own problems, especially if they are not configured well. Some problems are described in RFC 3143.\nWeb proxy.\nA web proxy is a proxy server that focuses on the traffic over the World Wide Web. It may be used to block offensive web content, or to control access of clients to online content. They may be used by corporations or countries.\nWeb proxies can also be used to track how different individuals have used internet access.\nAnonymizing proxy server.\nAn anonymizing proxy server removes identifying information from the clients' requests, for the purpose of anonymity. They may also be used to break through filtered contents on the internet.\nOpen proxy.\nA proxy server is called an \"open proxy\" if everyone can connect to it and use it. Usually, open proxies are proxy servers which are badly configured. Open proxies may be abused easily; for example, a bad user may send a corrupting request to a remote server, but hide himself behind an open proxy, so the administrators of the remote server cannot stop him. Open proxies can also be used for spamming. For this reason, some websites do not allow connections to their web servers or to edit content on them through known open proxies, including on .\nForced proxy.\nA \"forced proxy\" server is a proxy server which handles all of the traffic from the client to the internet. The client will not know that the proxy exists, but all of the information passes through the proxy server. They are sometimes called \"transparent\" proxy servers, because the user does not know a proxy server is between the client and remote server.\nSMTP Proxy.\nA Transparent SMTP Proxy is a SMTP proxy server that is inserted in between a sending mail server and a receiving mail server. The main purpose of the SMTP proxy is to filter outbound spam. The proxy masquerades itself in such a way that the client and server believe that they are talking to each other even though there is a proxy in between.\nSoftware.\nThere is a lot of software which can be used for running a proxy server. Some software can only work as a proxy server, while other software can also work as a firewall or caching server. Squid, Varnish and Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server (ISA Server) are among the best known pieces of proxy server software. Some proxy software uses the SOCKS protocol. An example is the Java SOCKS Proxy Server."}

{"id": "65753", "revid": "8630", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65753", "title": "Cache (computing)", "text": "Caching is a term used in computer science. The idea behind a cache (pronounced \"cash\" ) is very simple: Very often, obtaining a result for a calculation is very time-consuming, so storing the result is generally a good idea. Two kinds of storage media are used: One is usually quite big, but accessing it is \"slow\"; the other one can be accessed much faster, but generally it is small. The very basic idea behind caching is to use the medium that is fast to access to have copies of data. There is no difference between the copy, and the original. Accessing the original data may take a long time, or it may be expensive to do (for example: the results of a difficult problem that take a long time to solve). For this reason, it is much \"cheaper\" to simply use the copy of the data from the cache. Put differently, a cache is a temporary storage area that has copies of data that is used often. When a copy of the data is in this cache, it is faster to use this copy rather than re-fetching or re-calculating the original data. This will make the average time needed to access the data shorter. Putting a new value into a cache often means that an older value needs to be replaced. There are different ideas (usually called \"strategies\") on how to select the value to replace. \nA buffer is very similar to a cache. It is different in that the client accessing the data in a buffer knows there is a buffer; the buffer is managed by the application. With a cache, the client accessing the data need not be aware there is a cache.\nTypical computer applications access data in very similar ways. Suppose the data is structured into \"blocks\", which can be accessed individually. When an application accesses a block it is also very likely to access (or reference) a block that is \"close\" to the original block. This is known as locality of reference. There are different kinds of such \"locality\". Locality of reference is one of the reasons why caches work well in many areas of computing. \nIn order to work well, caches are small, compared to the whole amount of data. The bigger the cache, the longer it takes to lookup an entry. Bigger caches are also more expensive to build.\nHow caches work.\nA cache is a block of memory for storing data which is likely used again. The CPU and hard drive often use a cache, as do web browsers and web servers. \nA cache is made up of many entries, called a \"pool\". Each entry holds a datum (a bit of data) which is a copy of a datum in another place. Caches usually use what is called a \"backing store\". Backing stores are slow or expensive to access, compared to the cache. A disk cache uses a hard disk as a backing store, for example. \nEach entry also has a little information attached, called a \"tag\". This tag is used to find the location where the original data is stored. \nCaches for reading.\nA client (a CPU, web browser, operating system) wants to access a bit of data, it believes to be in the backing store, it first checks to see if the datum can be found in the cache. If the data can be found in the cache, the client can use it and does not need to use the main memory. This is known as a cache hit. So, for example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular URL. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the contents of the web page is the datum.\nThe other situation that can occur is that the datum with the tag cannot be found in the cache. This is known as cache miss. The datum needs to be fetched from the backing store. Usually, it is copied into the cache, so that the next time, it no longer needs to be fetched from the backing store.\nThe cache only has a limited size. To make room for the previously uncached entry, another cached entry may need to be deleted from the cache. Special rules are used to find the entry that should best be deleted. These rules are usually called Heuristics. Heuristics used to find the entry are called replacement policy. A very simple rule used is called \"Least recently used\" (or LRU). It simply takes the entry that was used the longest time ago. Other heuristics are listed at cache algorithm..\nCaches for writing.\nCaches can also be used for writing data; the benefit of this is that the client can continue its operation once the entry has been written to the cache; it does not have to wait until the entry is written to the backing store. \nHowever, the entry must be written to the backing store at some point in time. The timing when this happens is controlled by the write policy.\nIn a write-through cache, each entry is written to the backing store immediately, as well as being stored in cache. \nThe other option is to only write to cache, and write to the backing store later. This is known as write-back (or write-behind) cache. The cache marks the entries that have not yet been written to the backing store; the mark that is used is often referred to as dirty flag. Before the entries are deleted from the cache, they are written to the backing store. This is known as lazy write. A miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often need two memory accesses: one to get the needed datum, and another to write replaced data from the cache to the store.\nThe caching policy may also say that a certain datum must be written to cache. The client may have made many changes to the datum in the cache. After it is done, it may explicitly tell the cache to write back the datum. \nNo-write allocation is a cache policy where only reads are cached. This avoids the need for write-back or write-through caching. Writes are done to the backing store all the time. \nThe client is not the application that changes data in the backing store. If the data changed in the backing store, the copy in the cache will be out of date, or \"stale\". Alternatively, when the client updates the data in the cache, copies of that data in other caches will become stale. There are special communication protocols that allow cache managers to talk to each other to keep the data meaningful. These are known as coherency protocols.\nSelecting the entry to replace.\nA cache is small, and it will be full, or almost full, most of the time. So when a new value is added, an old one needs to be removed. There are different ways in which this selection can be done:\nHistory.\nThe word \"cache\" was first used in computing in 1967, when a scientific article was prepared to be published in IBM Systems Journal. The article was about a new improvement of the memory in Model 85. Model 85 was a computer of the IBM System/360 product line. The editor of the Journal wanted a better word for \"high-speed buffer\", used in the article. He got no input, and suggested \"cache\", from the French \"cacher\", meaning \"to hide\". The article was published in early 1968, and the authors were honored by IBM. Their work was widely welcomed and improved.\"Cache\" soon became standard usage in computer literature.\nWhere caches are used.\nCPU caches.\nSmall memories on or close to the CPU chip can be made faster than the much larger main memory. Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches. Modern general-purpose CPUs inside personal computers may have as many as half a dozen. Each cache may be specialised to a different part of the task of executing programs.\nDisk caches.\nCPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware, other caches are managed by a different kinds of software. The operating system usually manages a \"page cache\" in main memory. Users outside computer science usually call this cache virtual memory. It is managed by the kernel of the operating system. \nModern hard drives have disk buffers. These are sometimes called \"disk cache\", but this is wrong. The main function of these buffers is to order disk writes, and to manage reads. Repeated cache hits are rare, because the buffer is very small compared to the size of the hard drive. \nLocal hard disks are fast compared to other storage devices, such as remote servers, local tape drives, or optical jukeboxes. Using local hard disks as caches is the main concept of hierarchical storage management.\nWeb caches.\nWeb browsers and web proxy servers use caches to store previous responses from web servers, such as web pages. Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted over the network. Information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve responsiveness for users of the web.\nModern web browsers use a built-in web cache, but some internet service providers or organizations also use a caching proxy server. This is a web cache that is shared between all users of that network.\nSearch engines also often make web pages they have indexed available from their cache. For example, Google provides a \"Cached\" link next to each search result. This is useful when web pages are temporarily inaccessible from a web server.\nCaching with unreliable networks.\nWrite-through operation is common in unreliable networks (like an Ethernet LAN). The protocol used to make sure the data in the write cache makes sense when several write caches are used is very complex, in such a case.\nFor instance, web page caches and client-side network file system caches (like those in NFS or SMB) are typically read-only or write-through to keep the network protocol simple and reliable.\nThe difference between buffer and cache.\nBuffer and cache are not mutually exclusive; they are also often used together. The reason why they are used is different, though. A buffer is a location in memory that is traditionally used because CPU instructions cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices. Computer memory is used as an intermediate store. \nAdditionally such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled (as required by a storage device), or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced. Also a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially (for example to hard disk), so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance. These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the buffer once and read from the buffer once.\nA cache also increases transfer performance. A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block. But the main performance gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same datum will be read from cache several times, or that written data will soon be read. The only purpose of Caches is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage. Cache is also usually an abstraction layer that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighboring layers. That way, the applications or clients may not be aware that there is a cache."}

The Warm-core cyclones are the tropical cyclones, mesocyclones, and the polar lows that lie within the smaller mesoscale. The Subtropical cyclones are intermediate in size. Cyclones have also been on other planets outside of the Earth, such as Mars and Neptune.

They consist of the eye, eyewall and rainbands.\nThe process of cyclone formation and intensification is described as Cyclogenesis. The formation of Extratropical cyclones comes as waves in large regions of enhanced midlatitude temperature contrasts which are called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the circulation of the cyclone closes and gets more intense. Later in their life cycle, cyclones form what is called an occluded front.

In an anticyclone it is the part from where all winds move out from.\nThe region surrounding the eye is the eyewall, where the worst weather is seen in a cyclone. These have strong winds, lots of rain and lots of cloud. There are also outer bands, which surround the cyclone, which forms the greatest part of the storm. These have winds so strong they can even form other tornadoes."}

They were very important in European history. They first ruled parts of Switzerland in the 13th century. They ruled Austria, later Austria-Hungary for more than 600 years, and also sometimes owned Spain and the Netherlands. They ruled the Holy Roman Empire from about 1280 to 1806. They also ruled the Kingdom of Sardinia until the middle 19th century. \nA Treaty was made in Vienna in 1515 between the king of Poland and duke of Lithuania from the Jagiellon dynasty and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, duke of Austria from the Habsburg family. It said that if the kings of Bohemia and Hungary, (Jagiellons), were to die without male heirs the Duke of Austria would take over their territory. \nEnd of the House.\nThe House of Habsburg became extinct in the 18th century. The senior branch ended when Charles II of Spain died in 1700 and was replaced by the House of Bourbon. The mental and physical handicaps of Charles II were probably caused by inbreeding between relatives in the royal houses of continental Europe. Marriages of close relatives occurred for five generations before him. He was the son of Philip IV, who married his sister's daughter.\nThe remaining branch went extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and completely in 1780 with the death of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa of Austria. It was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine. The new successor house styled itself formally as House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: \"Habsburg-Lothringen\"), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg.\nThe last empress was Zita of Bourbon-Parma. She died in Switzerland in 1989. She had ruled with her husband, Charles I of Austria, from 1916 to 1918."}

It was the region that is now called Zimbabwe. The country replaced the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.\nNomenclature.\nThe official name of the country under British law was \"Southern Rhodesia\", but the government in Salisbury used the name \"Rhodesia\" instead. This situation dated back to October 1964, when the colony of Northern Rhodesia changed its name to Zambia following independence, so the colonial government felt that \"Southern\" Rhodesia should no longer be used because there was no \"Northern\" Rhodesia. However, Britain believed that only their government could change the colony's name and not the colony itself.\nHistory.\nUnilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI).\nThe British government adopted a policy called \"no independence before majority rule\", which dictated that colonies with a certain amount of white settlers would not become independent until they adopted a policy of majority rule. This had conflicted with the beliefs of the white minority Rhodesian Front, lead by Ian Smith, which believed that Rhodesia should become an independent country anyway. This continued until relations between the colony and the British government broke down in 1965.\nOn 11 November 1965, Smith's government issued a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom. Many countries condemned the UDI and the United Nations Security Council placed sanctions on Rhodesia.\nRhodesia sought international recognition as a Commonwealth realm, with Queen Elizabeth II as \"Queen of Rhodesia\", but later severed it links to the British Crown by becoming a republic on 2 March 1970.\nThe Bush War.\nAs early as 1960, many African nationalists began to challenge Rhodesia's minority rule policies. In 1964, tensions boiled over and the Rhodesian Bush War began. On one side, the minority rule government, led by Ian Smith, hoped to keep the whites in power. On the other side, the ZANU-PF, led by Robert Mugabe, fought for majority rule. After about 15 years of fighting, the Lancaster House Agreement was signed which allowed majority rule. This led to Zimbabwe's independence."}

He gave the species its name, \"Megalosaurus bucklandii\". \nBecause a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build. The first naturalists who investigated Megalosaurus thought it was a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842 Richard Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs as a quadruped. \nLater it was realised that all theropods were bipedal. Today is known that the early proto-dinosaurs in the late Middle Triassic were also bipedal. Certainly \"Eoraptor\", from 231.4 million years ago, was bipedal. That means the dinosaurs were bipedal from the start (primatively bipedal). Only the heavier sauropods and armoured dinosaurs became quadrupedal, standing on all four legs."}

It alone has parliamentary sovereignty over all other political bodies. The parliament has an upper house, the House of Lords, and a lower house, the House of Commons. At its head is the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. The monarch is the third part of Parliament. The British people choose the people in the lower house (members of parliament) in elections.\nThe development of parliament started with the councils of bishops and earls that advised the kings and queens of the Middle Ages. In 1707, during the early modern period, the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland joined to become the Parliament of Great Britain. The first Parliament of the United Kingdom came into existence in 1801, after the Irish Parliament joined with the Parliament of Great Britain. Between 1801 and 1927, the British legislature's name was the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. \nHow the British Parliament works.\nThe Parliament of the United Kingdom is split into three separate parts, the House of Commons (the lower house), the House of Lords (the upper house) and the monarch. Most legislative power is concentrated in the House of Commons. It is made up of 650 members of parliament (MPs). These people are elected by the people of the United Kingdom to represent them in the House of Commons. The leader of the political party who commands a majority of MPs is usually made the prime minister of the United Kingdom, the head of government. The head of state is always the monarch.\nThe House of Commons starts most bills. Other bills start in the House of Lords. The House of Commons decides rates of taxation.\nThe House of Lords has the power to reject bills, except money bills (tax bills), and make the House of Commons reconsider them. If the House of Lords vetoes a bill twice or delays a \"public\" Bill for more than one year then the House of Commons can force the Bill through under the terms of the Parliament Acts, unless it started in the House of Lords.\nThe monarch (now HM Queen Elizabeth II) is the sovereign in a constitutional monarchy and, theoretically, is the fount of all power in the United Kingdom. Bills must receive the Royal Assent before becoming Acts of Parliament and the monarch is responsible for summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament, normally upon the advice of the incumbent Prime Minister. It is now very rare for a monarch to object, but the sovereign still retains this prerogative for use if necessary.\nHow a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament.\nBills may start their passage in either the House of Commons or House of Lords\nPre-legislative Scrutiny: Joint committee of both houses review bill and vote on amendments that government can accept or reject. Reports are influential in later stages as rejected committee recommendations are revived to be voted on.\nFirst Reading: No vote occurs. Bill is presented, printed, and in private members' bills, a Second Reading date is set.\nSecond Reading: A debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote.\nCommittee Stage: A committee considers each clause of the bill, and may make amendments.\nReport Stage: An opportunity to amend the bill. The House consider clauses to which amendments have been tabled.\nThird Reading: A debate on final text as amended. In the Lords, further amendments may be tabled at this stage.\nPassage: The bill is then sent to the other House which may amend it.\nFirst Reading: \"Same procedures\"\nSecond Reading: \"Same procedures\"\nCommittee Stage: \"Same procedures\"\nReport Stage: \"Same procedures\"\nThird Reading: \"Same procedures\"\nPassage: The bill is then returned to the original House.\nPre-legislative Scrutiny: To consider all amendments.\nThe bill is then processed for Royal Assent, if accepted, the bill becomes an Act.\nHistory.\nIn the Middle Ages and early modern period there were three kingdoms within the British Isles \u2014 England, Scotland and Ireland \u2014 and these developed separate parliaments. The 1707 Acts of Union brought England and Scotland together under the Parliament of Great Britain, and the 1800 Act of Union included Ireland under the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The parliament at Westminster in London is sometimes called the \"Mother of all Parliaments\"\nParliament of England.\nThe English Parliament has its origins in the Anglo-Saxon \"\". In 1066, William of Normandy brought a feudal system, where he sought the advice of a council before making laws. In 1215, this council got the Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which slowly developed into a parliament.\nIn 1265, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester called the first elected Parliament. The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535\u201342 annexed Wales as a part of England and brought Welsh representatives to Parliament.\nWhen Elizabeth I was succeeded in 1603 by the Scottish King James VI of Scotland (James I of England) the countries both came under his rule, but each kept its own Parliament. \nParliament of Scotland.\nIn Scotland in the High Middle Ages the King's Council of Bishops and Earls was the beginning of the Parliament of 1235.\nParliament of Ireland.\nThe Irish Parliament was founded to represent the English community in the Lordship of Ireland, but the native or Gaelic Irish were not allowed to vote or stand for office, the first known meeting being in 1264.\nIn 1541 Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland. The Gaelic Irish lords were now entitled to attend the Irish Parliament as equals of the majority of English descent."}

It is an auditorium where events are held.\nThe Albert Hall is one of the most famous buildings in the world. Events like concerts for classical music or pop music, ballet, even tennis or boxing matches, or large ceremonies or parties or conferences. In the summer the BBC Proms take place there every day. The Royal Albert Hall has been holding concerts since 1941.\nThe history of how it was built.\nIn the early 19th century the whole area was still countryside. In 1851, there was a Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, just next to Kensington Park opposite where the RAH now stands. The exhibition building, called Crystal Palace, was a glass building which was just there for the exhibition. Prince Albert had the idea that public buildings should be built in the area for the arts and sciences. Some huge museums were built, including the Science Museum, Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum etc. When Prince Albert died in 1861 this plan had only just got started. The Royal Albert Hall was built and named after him. Queen Victoria laid the first stone.\nThe Royal Albert Hall is very large. As many as 9,000 people used to get in, but now the safety rules make about 5,500 the usual number. It is round, like an Ancient Greek or Roman amphitheatre. This is why the floor area is called the \u201carena\u201d (as in an amphitheatre). There is a very large glass and wrought-iron dome. It is 41m high. Round the outside, a little lower than the roof, there is a big mosaic frieze with pictures of \"The Triumph of Arts and Sciences\" and some writing in terracotta letters. It says that the first stone was laid by Her Majesty Queen Victoria on 20 May 1867 and was opened by her on 29 March 1871. It also has some words from the Bible. When Queen Victoria opened the building she was so emotional that she could not speak. Her son Edward, the Prince of Wales had to say her words for her. He said: \"The Queen declares this Hall is now open\".\nThe RAH throughout its history.\nThe hall has been used for lots of important events ever since 1871. Many of the seats are still owned by members of a Corporation which was called \u201cthe Corporation of the Hall of Arts and Sciences\u201d. This group had been formed in 1866 as a charity to get money to build the hall. Its members still have a right to occupy 1,300 of the 5,200 seats.\nThere was a problem with the sound because there was too much echo. It was not until 1969 that something was done about it. Big fibreglass dishes were hung from the ceiling. People who go to the RAH today call them \u201cmushrooms\u201d or sometimes \u201cflying saucers\u201d. They make music sound much better.\nThere is a very large organ at the front of the hall. It was built by an organ maker called Henry Willis and was later rebuilt by Harrison &amp; Harrison and most recently by Mander Organs; It is the biggest organ in the British Isles with 9,997 pipes.\nThe Promenade Concerts which were started by Henry Wood in 1895 have taken place in the RAH ever since 1941 when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombs in World War II. For two months there is at least one concert every day, and people can be seen queuing for standing tickets all the way down the steps towards Prince Consort Road.\nPeople who go to the proms today can choose between standing in the arena (the flat area downstairs), or sitting in the stalls (the seats around the side of the arena), or sitting in the Loggia Boxes, Second Tier Boxes, Circle (upstairs), Choir (where the choir sit if there is one, i.e. behind the orchestra) or standing in the gallery (at the very top). For some events such as tennis matches or ballets or operas the action takes place in the arena, so audience do not sit or stand there.\nRecent improvements.\nDuring the last few years a lot of money has been spent on improving the Royal Albert Hall. The 1,800 seats in the balcony (now called the \u201cCircle\u201d) were very uncomfortable, so new seats were put in which are slightly bigger. The south entrance has been made into the main entrance (as it was years ago), with a porch to match the north entrance. The area south of the hall has been blocked off to traffic and pedestrianised. Dressing rooms (where artists change) are now on stage level instead of down in a basement. There is an underground car park and loading area so that lorries bringing things do not need to unload in the street and get in the way of the people. Lots of other improvements have been made, including better ventilation."}

The most common way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit the ball over the outfield fence in fair territory. If the ball goes over the outfield fence but it is ruled a \"foul ball\", it does not count as a home run. Another way for a batter to hit a home run is to hit what is called an \"inside-the-park\" home run. If the batter touches all four bases after he hits the ball and it stays on the field, he scores a home run. This is an inside-the-park home run as long as no error is committed by the fielding team on the play.\nIn the early days of Major League Baseball, a home run was not awarded to a ball hit over the fence to win the game if the winning run scored before the batter-runner were to reach home plate to score. Therefore, what would otherwise be walk-off home runs were not commonplace, and players were often robbed of home runs. Due to this, for instance, Babe Ruth is not credited with a particular walk-off home run that would bring his career total to 715."}

The choice of colors usually follows the rule of tincture from heraldry, but exceptions to this rule are known.\nCommon primary colors include orange, purple, blue, red, and green. These colors are either paired with a color representing a metal (often black, brown, gray (or silver), white, or gold), or occasionally each other, such as orange/blue, red/green, or blue/yellow. Pairing two metals, such as black/white, silver or gold, and especially black/gold, is also a common practice. Finally, some American schools, in a display of patriotism, adopt the national colors of red/white/blue.\nIn an effort to further establish identity and promote a standard, many institutions often decree the use of specific shades of colors. Maroon, generally regarded as a darker shade of red, is a common primary color. Various shades of blue, from powder to Prussian, are also in use; a few schools have adopted two different shades of blue for their colors, with the darker shade serving as the primary. The shade of gold can vary greatly even within an institution, from a vivid yellow to a more convincing old gold.\nBlack, white and gray are often used as neutral colors for sets that do not otherwise adopt them. This practice is especially notable in basketball (where home uniforms are often white) and professional baseball (where team colors are often used as trim for white or gray uniforms).\nUses.\nMost competitive teams keep two sets of uniforms, with one design emphasizing the primary color and the other emphasizing the secondary color. In some sports, such as football, the primary color is emphasized on home uniforms, while uniforms for other sports, notably basketball, use the secondary or a neutral color at home. This is done to avoid confusion when playing a team with similar colors.\nIn addition, various groups that generate support for athletic teams, including cheerleaders and marching bands, wear uniforms with the colors of their school.\nAt many private schools 'school colours' are awards presented for achievement in a subject or a sport - See Sporting Colours."}

{"id": "65909", "revid": "7850904", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65909", "title": "Hebrew calendar", "text": "The Hebrew calendar or Jewish calendar is the calendar used in Judaism. It is used to set the dates of the Jewish holidays and the weekly public reading of the Torah. It is used to set the date for a Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah, the day a young person is considered an adult in Judaism. It sets the \"Yahrzeit,\" the anniversary of the death of a relative. The daily Jewish prayer service changes depending on the day of the Hebrew calendar.\nBasic rules.\nThe Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar which depends on both the moon and the sun. Months of the Hebrew calendar are based on the appearance of the new moon. At the same time, the holiday of Passover must be in the spring. For this reason, years of the Hebrew calendar are based on the sun.\nOne solar (sun-based) year lasts about 365 days, but twelve lunar (moon-based) months only last about 354 days. For this reason, the Hebrew calendar adds an extra lunar month seven times in each cycle of 19 years. This rule makes the average Hebrew calendar year about the same length as a solar year, 365 days.\nThe seven-day week is used to figure out the day for Shabbat, the day of rest. The week does not depend on the solar year or lunar month. Instead, it depends on a count of seven days that is believed to go back to ancient times. The week is also an important part of the Hebrew calendar.\nHistory.\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Jews have been using a lunisolar calendar since the time they left Egypt. The first commandment the Jewish people received as a nation was the commandment to determine the New Moon. Very soon after that, the Jews received the commandment to make sure that Passover falls in the spring.\nIn the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), the months are usually numbered rather than named. (See table below.) Only four month names appear in the Tanakh from before the Babylonian Exile (see table). The month names of the modern Hebrew calendar were taken from the month names in the Babylonian calendar during the Babylonian Exile (6th century BCE).\nAt first, a new month began when witnesses came to the Sanhedrin (high rabbinical court) and testified that they saw the new crescent moon in the sky. The Sanhedrin also decided when an extra month should be added to the calendar to keep Passover in the spring. (See Metonic cycle.) After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, it became harder for the Sanhedrin to meet and hear witnesses. For that reason, the Sanhedrin established a fixed, rule-based form of the calendar. Maimonides fully described the modern Hebrew calendar around the year 1178 CE.\nIn the modern Hebrew calendar, years are counted as \"Anno Mundi\" (Latin for \"year of the world\"). This represents the traditional count of years since the creation of the world as described in Genesis. This year is \"anno mundi\" .\nIn Karaite Judaism.\nIn the small Karaite Judaism community, the calendar is very similar. However, Karaites use witnesses to set the date of the new crescent moon. They still use the ripening of barley to decide whether to add an extra month to the year. For those reasons, the Karaite calendar can be slightly different from the main Jewish calendar.\nDetails.\nThe day and the week.\nIn the Hebrew calendar, the meaning of \"day\" is taken from the Hebrew Bible: \"And there was evening, and there was morning, one day\". Because \"evening\" comes before \"morning\", a \"day\" in the Hebrew calendar starts in the evening. For many purposes, the \"day\" in the Hebrew calendar begins at sunset. But when it is important to make sure the previous day is completely over, the day begins at nightfall.\nPeople who print calendars, or who write calendar programs for computers, ignore that rule. They treat the Hebrew calendar date and the Gregorian calendar date that has the same midnight as being the same day. They assume that people reading a Hebrew calendar know the sundown rule. Whenever a holiday, birthday or anniversary appears on a printed calendar, it actually begins on the day before, at sundown.\nIn the Hebrew calendar, every seventh day is Shabbat, the day of rest. The \"week\" is the cycle of counting out each set of seven days ending in Shabbat. The week is not affected by any other calendar calculation. In Hebrew, the only name for the first six days of the week is a counting name: \"First day\", \"Second day\", etc. The only day of the week with a special name is the seventh day\u2014Shabbat. (See table above.)\nThe \"molad\".\nThe calculation of the Hebrew calendar year and month start with the \"molad\". \"Molad\" is a Hebrew word meaning \"birth\". The word refers to the \"birth\" of the new moon each month. The modern Hebrew calendar uses a calculated \"molad:\" the \"average\" length of the cycle from new moon to new moon over many years. The length of the molad is 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, seconds.\nRegular years and leap years.\nA year of 12 lunar months would be 354 days long; but a Hebrew calendar year must be a solar year\u2014about 365 days long. Also, a Hebrew calendar year must have either 12 months or 13 months. It is not allowed to have \"part\" of a month, so a thirteenth month is added seven times in every cycle of nineteen years. This is an adaptationn 2 of the Metonic cycle, a calendar cycle that was well known in ancient times. By conventionn 3, the Hebrew calendar adds the extra month during years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 of the cycle.\nCalculating Rosh Hashanah for this year and next year.\nHebrew calendar months are supposed to be lunar months. For that reason, the calculation of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, starts with the \"molad\" for the month of Tishrei. Starting from there, the calendar rules allow two main reasons to delay Rosh Hashanah by one or more days:\nOnce the dates for this year's and next year's Rosh Hashanahs are known, calculating the calendar in between is easy.\nCalculating the calendar.\nThe length of a \"molad\" is just a little over days. Since a month must have a whole number of days, calculating the calendar starts with alternating months of 30 and 29 days. This gives an average of days and a 12-month total of 354 days. Starting from there, the month lengths are changed as follows:\nCalendar months and the astronomical new moon.\nThe first day of the Hebrew calendar month, known as \"Rosh Hodesh\" (), is always close to the astronomical new moon. It often is not exactly on the astronomical new moon. There are two reasons for that:\nOther websites.\n\"The English of these sites may not be Simple English.\""}

They were at their most popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Tom plays acoustic guitar and Dick plays upright bass, and both men sing. They pretend to get into arguments about the songs, and this forms much of their comedy act.\nEarly career.\nThe Smothers Brothers began their career during the folk music boom in the United States, during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Their comedy got them noticed, and they began to make records and appear on television. Later they starred in their own television series, \"The Smothers Brothers Show\". They did not sing or perform music on this show, but instead Dick played a man whose brother (Tom) became his .\n\"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\".\nTheir next series, \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", was a variety show, with live performances by musical guests, and sometimes actors and comedians. The brothers hosted the program, which began in 1967. They would begin with a song in their usual style, and introduce the performers. Along with guests, the show had regular actors and writers. These included Steve Martin, Pat Paulsen, Bob Einstein, Mason Williams, Leigh French and Lorenzo Music.\nSome of the guests who appeared on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" were Bette Davis, Tony Randall, Kate Smith, Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, and Inger Stevens. Some of their musical guests were Pete Seeger, The Turtles, Janis Ian, Jefferson Airplane, Nancy Sinatra, The First Edition (with a young Kenny Rogers), Donovan, Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Jennifer Warnes, Harry Nilsson and The Buckinghams. Glen Campbell regularly appeared on the show, and hosted a summer replacement series, \"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour\".\nSometimes the performances had controversial topics, like the Vietnam War, population and many social issues. CBS, who broadcast the show, sometimes censored it, taking parts out that a large number of people might disagree with. They warned the brothers about presenting things that might cause upset to viewers. The Smotherses and their staff, though, believed it was important to comment about such things. The issues mattered to them, and were affecting people around the United States and the world.\nIn 1969, CBS cancelled the show, even though they had already promised another season of shows would be made. The reason given was that David Steinberg, a comedian whose style included , had been invited back to appear even though CBS had his reappearance. The two sides went to court.\nIn 1973, the court decided CBS had violated (broken) their contract with the Smothers Brothers, and that the real reason they had cancelled the show was out of censorship. CBS had to pay the Smotherses for the never-made season. The reputation of the brothers, though, had suffered.\nLater career.\nThe Smothers Brothers tried to produce a new show, this time for the ABC television network, but it did not last long. Times had changed, and viewers were now interested in other shows and performers.\nThe brothers went back to appearing live, in small clubs and large venues, as the chances came. One night in 1974, they were appearing in the Troubadour Club in Los Angeles, California. Two members of the audience were Harry Nilsson and John Lennon, who both knew the Smothers Brothers offstage. (Tom Smothers had even appeared on Lennon's 1969 single \"Give Peace A Chance\", as a member of the Plastic Ono Band, while Nilsson had appeared on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\".) As it turned out, Nilsson and Lennon were drunk, and began to the brothers, thinking it would help the show. It did not, and Nilsson and Lennon were finally escorted out. (They both sent flowers to the Smotherses the next day, and issued an apology.)\nThe Smothers Brothers remained popular with many fans, and continued to perform their act as years went by. They appeared on programs like \"The Tonight Show\" during the 1970s and 1980s. A television special in 1988 reunited many of the \"Comedy Hour\" cast members, and another short-lived series was produced. CBS aired the new programs, having long ago made peace with the Smotherses.\nIn later years, the Smothers Brothers appeared in Las Vegas and Branson, Missouri, still performing their familiar act. They continue to tour, more than fifty years after their careers began, often backed by local symphony orchestras."}

Ingmar Bergman found bleakness and despair as well as comedy and hope in his indelible explorations of the human condition. He is regarded as one of the great masters of modern cinema.\nMany filmmakers worldwide, including Americans Woody Allen and Robert Altman, the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky and the Taiwanese director Ang Lee, have cited the work of Bergman as a major influence on their work.\nBiography.\nErnst Ingmar Bergman was born in Uppsala, Sweden to a Lutheran minister of Danish descent, Erik Bergman (later chaplain to the King of Sweden), and his wife, Karin (\"n\u00e9e\" \u00c5kerblom). He grew up surrounded by religious imagery and discussion. His father was a rather conservative parish minister and strict family father: Ingmar was locked up in dark closets for infractions such as wetting the bed. \"While father preached away in the pulpit and the congregation prayed, sang or listened,\" Ingmar writes in his biography \"Laterna Magica\",\nHe performed two five-month stretches of mandatory military service and studied Art and Literature at Stockholm University College (the later Stockholm University), but without graduating. Instead, he developed an interest in theatre and later in cinema (though he had become a \"genuine movie addict\" by the early 1930s). \nAlthough he grew up in a devout Lutheran household, Bergman stated that he lost his faith at age eight but came to terms with this fact only when making \"Winter Light\".\nFrom the early sixties, Bergman lived much of his life on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, Gotland, Sweden, where he made a number of his movies. Bergman moved to Munich for a while following a protracted battle with the Swedish government over alleged tax evasion, and did not return to make another movie in Sweden until 1982, when he directed \"Fanny and Alexander\". Bergman said this would be his last movie, and that he would go on to direct theater. Since that time he did make a number of movies for television, but later retired to F\u00e5r\u00f6, stating in 2004 that he would never again leave the island.\nIngmar Bergman died at his home on F\u00e5r\u00f6, in the early morning of 30 July 2007, aged 89, the same day that another great movie director, Michelangelo Antonioni, died.\nFamily.\nBergman was married five times:\nThe first four marriages ended in divorce. The last ended when his wife Ingrid died of stomach cancer in 1995, aged 65. Aside from his marriages, Bergman had romantic relationships with actresses Harriet Andersson (1952\u201355), Bibi Andersson (1955\u201359), and Liv Ullmann (1965\u201370). He was the father of writer Linn Ullmann with Liv Ullmann. In all, Bergman had nine children, one of whom died before him. \nAwards.\nAcademy Awards.\nIn 1971, Bergman received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the Academy Awards ceremony. Three of his films won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The list of his nominations and awards follows:"}

A group of scientists lead by Alan Charig and Angela Milner of the Natural History Museum of London examined the skeleton and named the animal \"Baryonyx\" (meaning 'heavy claw'), and the species name \"walkeri\" after the man who discovered it. Other good skeletons were discovered in England and in Spain, which gave scientists a good idea of what the dinosaur was like.\n\"Baryonyx\" grew up to between long and weighed 1.2 and 1.7 t (1.3 and 1.9 short tons). It had long arms which were probably used for holding on to prey, the claw on the first finger was 31 centimeters (12\u00a0in) long. It ate mostly fish, like a grizzly bear would; for this it had a long snout like a gharial, and straight, cone-like teeth perfect for fishing.

The notation for this can be written as :\nformula_1\nwhere \"b\" is an integer, or \"whole\" number, that describes the number of times 10 is multiplied by itself and the letter \"a\" any real number, called the significand or mantissa (\"using \"mantissa\" may cause confusion as it can also refer to the fractional part of the common logarithm\").\nNormalized notation.\nWritten in the form , exponent \"b\" is chosen such that the absolute value of \"a\" remains at least one but less than ten formula_2. Normal mathematics convention dictates a minus sign to precede the first of the decimal digits of \"a\" for a negative number; that of \"b\" for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1, e.g. minus one half is . There is no need to represent zero in normalized form, the digit 0 is sufficient. The normalized form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign in \"a\", as the exponent \"b\" gives the number's order of magnitude."}

After 1990, the party reformed itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (later in 2005, the Left Party.PDS). It is still somewhat popular in parts the former East German territory, frequently winning seats at state and local elections. In the September 2005 Bundestag election the PDS was in coalition with WASG (Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice), which was formed by Oskar Lafontaine who left the SPD. The PDS and WASG joined together in 2007.\nA famous SED poster read: \"To learn from Stalin means to learn how to win\". Later, the word \"Stalin\" was replaced with \"the USSR\". When Gorbachev was president of the USSR the famous slogan was abandoned, as the SED did not believe there was anything to learn from his ideas about perestroika.\nAt first the SED had a branch in West Berlin, but in 1962 the West Berlin branch was separated from the SED proper and became a \"separate\" party called the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Westberlins\" \u2013 SEW) but with the same ideas as the parent party.\nThe final days.\nBetween the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the election in March 1990, the old Social Democratic Party was re-established as a separate party, while the rest of the SED lost a lot of members and renamed itself the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) at a special party meeting in December 1989. By becoming the PDS the party survived the reuniting of East Germany and West Germany, and eventually started growing again, managing to get representatives elected to the Bundestag.\nOn December 1, 1989 the SED was forced to give up its 40 year monopoly of power when the State Council (Volksammer) revoked the clause in the constitution of the GDR that guaranteed the SED to be the sole legal party in East Germany.

He founded five universities in North Rhine-Westphalia during the 1970s. He also started Germany's first distance learning university at Hagen (modelled on the \"Open University\" in Britain).\nIn 1978 Rau became Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he remained until 1998, winning four elections for the SPD, which became biggest party in the Landtag each time and gained an absolute majority three times, in 1980, 1985, 1990 and finally 1995.

On 1 July 2004, he was succeeded by Horst K\u00f6hler.\nIn 2000 Rau was the first German head of state since the Holocaust to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in German. Some Israeli delegates to walked out, but Israeli President Moshe Katsav supported and praised him for bridging the gap between the two states.\nFollowing a long history of heart disease, he died a few days after his 75th birthday.\nPrivate life.\nJohannes Rau was a practising Christian. He was sometimes called , \"Brother John\", to make fun of his strong Christian belief; but, he sometimes used this term himself.\nOn 9 August 1982 he married the political scientist Christina Delius (born 1956).

{"id": "66130", "revid": "561947", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66130", "title": "Voltaic pile", "text": "The voltaic pile was the first ever battery. It was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist.\nHow the voltaic pile is made.\nThe picture to the right shows a voltaic pile: it's a pile, or \"stack\" of discs, made from 3 different materials. Some of the discs are made from copper, some from zinc. Other metals can be used; but it's important that there are two \"different\" kinds of metal. There are also discs made from leather, fabric, or cardboard: these are the green discs in the picture. They must be soaked, or \"made wet\", with something acidic.\nNote how the discs follow a pattern: first a disc made from one of the metals, then a cardboard or leather disc, then a disc made from the other kind of metal. Then the same kinds of discs, in the same order, again and again. In the picture, you can see how one \"set\" of zinc disc, cardboard disc and copper disc has been \"pushed\" a little to the right. Such a \"set\" is called a \"cell\": the voltaic pile in the picture has 6 cells. The two different metal discs in a cell will each have a voltage across it; about 1.1 volts. Stacking cells in a pile adds to the voltage of the cells, and from the discs at the top and bottom of the voltaic pile in the picture, there is a voltage of 6 \u00d7 1.1 volts = 6.6 volts.\nHow the voltaic pile works.\nThe acid in the leather, fabric, or cardboard discs will try to dissolve some of the metal in the zinc discs. To be dissolved, a zinc atom must give away 2 of its electrons. The zinc atom then becomes an ion: Ions can \"go where they want to\" in the liquid acid. They go through the leather/cardboard disc, and meet the copper disc. The zinc ions are \"missing\" the two electrons they left behind, so when they get to the copper disc, they each \"steal\" two electrons to replace the missing ones. When they \"steal\" electrons, the zinc ions turn back from ions to \"normal\" zinc atoms. Saltwater can also be used in the cardboard, fabric, or leather, in a voltaic pile using copper and zinc plates.\nThe result is that the zinc disc ends up with a lot of electrons \"left behind\" by the zinc ions, and the copper disc ends up \"missing\" a lot of electrons \"stolen\" by the zinc ions. To use the electricity that comes from the pile, we must connect something that uses electricity to the two discs at the top and bottom of the pile. Doing so gives the electrons left behind in the zinc disc a \"chance\" to go to the copper disc. At the copper disc, the electrons \"replace\" those that were \"stolen\" from the copper by the zinc.\nHow Volta got the idea.\nLuigi Galvani was an Italian, working with anatomy. About 1786 he had seen something interesting: he had dissected (cut apart) a frog, and when he touched one of its legs with two tools made from different metals, it moved even though the frog had been killed before the dissection.\nGalvani himself thought this had something to do with the leg, and not with the metal tools he used. Volta saw that the tools \"must\" be made from two \"different\" metals for the leg to move. Volta also found that he could make a little electricity just by making two different metals touch each other. He thought that the two different metals gave something he called \"contact tension\", and the electricity came from that contact tension. Galvani and Volta talked a lot about this, but they never agreed.\nVolta tried to make use of it all. He made experiments with (and tried out) rods of different kinds of metals, in wine carafes (a kind of bottle). This way, he found that the best metals to use, are silver and zinc. He could also make it better by using flat discs instead of rods of metal. This is because the discs have more surface area than the rod; this gives more \"room\" for the zinc ions to leave one disc and get in touch with the other.\nOriginally, Volta put an extra disc of each metal at the top and bottom of the stack. These were later proved to be unnecessary.\nWhat happened after the invention.\nBefore the voltaic pile was invented, people could make only static electricity. With the voltaic pile, they could make electricity that keeps flowing for some time. Along with this, it was an invention that could be easily made. With this kind of electricity, scientists could do a lot of \"new\" things. For instance, when new kinds of metal were discovered, the electricity from a voltaic pile could \"sort\" chemicals. This way, small but very pure bits of these \"new\" metals could be made."}

{"id": "66133", "revid": "111904", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66133", "title": "Voltmeter", "text": "A voltmeter is an instrument used to measure voltage. For instance, a voltmeter can be used to see if there is more electricity left in a battery. The creation of voltmeters became possible when Hans Oersted invented the most simple voltmeter in 1819.\nConnecting a voltmeter.\nThe voltmeter can be connected by joining two wires to where the voltage is. One wire is the positive one, and the other the negative. With some voltmeters, one \"must\" make sure that the wires are connected to the right spots: the positive connection on the voltmeter to the more positive \"part\" of the voltage source, and the negative to the more negative \"part\". This way, the voltmeter is parallel to the electrical circuit.\nOne should also be careful about handling the connection: If there is a high voltage (many volts), one can get hurt or even killed by touching the metal connections with the voltage directly.\nHow voltmeters show the voltage.\nWhen the connections are made, the voltmeter shows the voltage. As there is no direct way to access the voltage, voltmeters are designed as special sort of ammeter which can calculate the voltage by assessing the electrical current and applying Ohm's law.\nThere are two kinds of voltmeters. One kind has a needle, or \"pointer\", that points to a number that tells the number of volts. This is the kind of voltmeter where one has to be careful about making the positive and negative connections correctly \u2013 if the wrong connections are made, the voltmeter can be damaged.\nThe second kind of voltmeter shows the numbers in a \"digital\" way, just like digital clocks and calculators. This kind of voltmeter is not damaged from \"wrong\" connections; instead, they show a negative number.\nAlso, there are two types of voltmeters, based on the current type: some voltmeters are designed for use in direct current (DC) while others are designed for alternating current (AC). Modern voltmeters can work in both currents.\nUsing the right kind of voltmeter.\nAll voltmeters have an upper limit, or a \"maximum number\" of volts they can \"handle\". If a voltmeter is used for bigger voltages than it was made to \"handle\", it may damage or destroy it.\nVoltmeters with settings, and multimeters.\nBecause it is important to use the right kind of voltmeter, they are most often made so they can be adjusted to measure all kinds of voltages. Such voltmeters usually have a \"knob\" or switch that can be set in different ways. If the voltmeter is set in one way, the voltmeter handles voltages up to, for example, 10 volts. If the switch is set in another way, the voltmeter can handle 100 volts, and so on. Inside the voltmeter, the switch usually works by changing resistors in a voltage divider.\nIn this way, one single voltmeter can be used for a lot of different voltages, large and small. Some modern voltmeters can do this setting all by themselves, one just has to make the connection and not worry about if the voltmeter can handle the voltage. It will automatically find a setting that can handle it.\nToday, a voltmeter is usually part of a multimeter, an instrument that can work as both a voltmeter, an ammeter, and usually a few more measuring instruments. These also have switces, used to \"tell\" the multimeter to \"be a voltmeter\".\nMultimeters often have more than two connections, and part of \"telling\" the multimeter what to measure (that is, whether to be a voltmeter or an amperemeter) is done by choosing the right two connections. This is explained in the manual for the multimeter, and often shown next to the connection points.\nUse of amplifiers for sensitive measurement of voltage.\nThe first type of voltmeters show the voltage using a needle or \"pointer\" pointing to the number of volts. These voltmeters take energy from the thing being measured to move the needle. Some very weak voltage sources might not have enough energy to move the needle to the right voltage. In that case, such a voltmeter shows too few volts. The voltmeter is not sensitive enough.\nOne solution to the above problem is to make the needle use as little energy as possible to move. However, there is a limit to how sensitive this kind of voltmeter can be. When vacuum tubes and transistors were invented, it became possible to build electronic amplifiers. By using an amplifier, a voltmeter can measure \"very\" small voltages from \"very\" weak sources. Modern voltmeters and multimeters normally have this kind of amplifier in them."}
{"id": "66137", "revid": "7893529", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66137", "title": "Powderfinger", "text": "Powderfinger were a rock band from Brisbane, Australia. The band started in 1989. The band\u2019s members were Bernard Fanning (singer, guitarist), Darren Middleton (guitarist), Ian Haug (guitarist), John Collins (bass), and Jon Coghill (drums).\nAfter some extended plays (EPs) that sold quite well, and making one full album, Powderfinger became popular in Australia with their second album; \"Double Allergic\". Their third album, \"Internationalist\", was even more popular and made them celebrities. It sold over 350,000 copies. \"Odyssey Number Five\" was their fourth album and was released in 2000. It is their most famous album; it was sold overseas in the United States and Canada. Powderfinger's next two albums were not as popular as the earlier ones, but still got to number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) charts.\nHistory.\nPowderfinger started in Brisbane, Australia, in 1989. Ian Haug, John Collins, and Steven Bishop (drums), had been playing music with other bands, when they decided to form Powderfinger. The band's name came from the song \"Powderfinger\" by Neil Young. Haug met Bernard Fanning at university and Fanning decided to join the band. Later, Jon Coghill joined when Bishop left. Darren Middleton was the last person to join, when Powderfinger saw one of his other bands playing and invited him to join.\nEarly work.\nPowderfinger released their first extended play (EP), called \"Powderfinger\", in 1992. This was followed by \"Transfusion\" in 1993. \"Transfusion\" was popular in Australia, and got to number one on the ARIA Alternative Chart, a chart for alternative rock music. Powderfinger signed a contract with record label Polydor after releasing \"Transfusion\".\nTheir first EPs did not sell badly, so they made an album, \"Parables for Wooden Ears\", in 1994. It did not do very well, and Fanning said in an interview in 2004 that \"the music wasn't very good\". The band then released \"Double Allergic\" in 1996. This album became very popular in Australia; it sold more than 200,000 copies. Jonathan Lewis from Allmusic said \"\"Double Allergic\" established Powderfinger as one of the most exciting Australian rock acts of the late 1990s\". When they were making \"Double Allergic\", Middleton said it was the best music the band had made so far. After releasing the album, Powderfinger went on a tour with You Am I, playing at the Livid concerts.\nSuccessful releases.\nAfter \"Double Allergic\", Powderfinger began to work on their third album. The band worked in Melbourne with a new producer, Nick DiDia. In 1998, they released \"Internationalist\". The album went to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, and stayed in the top 50 for 101 weeks. It sold more than 350,000 copies. \"Internationalist\" was the first Powderfinger album to win an ARIA Award; it won \"Album of the Year\", \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Best Cover Art\" at the 1999 ARIA Awards. \"The Day You Come\", the first single, won \"Single of the Year\" in 1999.\nOn \"Internationalist\", Powderfinger included songs about their political opinions and social ideas, but they said this was not done on purpose. \"Internationalist\" sounded different to the band's first two albums. This was because the band experimented with new ways of playing their music and writing songs.\nPowderfinger's next album, \"Odyssey Number Five\" (released in 2000), is their most famous. It won many awards including \"Album of the Year\" from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, and the 2001 \"Album of the Year\" ARIA Award. It also got to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart. From \"Odyssey Number Five\", Powderfinger released their most popular single, \"My Happiness\". It won the 2001 \"Single of the Year\" ARIA Award, and got to number four on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two songs on \"Odyssey Number Five\" appeared in movies; \"These Days\" was from the movie \"Two Hands\", and \"My Kind of Scene\" was part of \"\".\n\"Odyssey Number Five\" was Powderfinger's shortest album yet. Similar to \"Internationalist\", it talked about political and social issues. It also had numerous songs about love. Fanning liked listening to gospel music, and to soul which is often about love, and wrote his own songs after listening to that. Reviewers disagreed on the album; \"Entertainment Weekly\" liked it and gave it a B+, saying the album experimented well, while Allmusic gave it one-and-a-half stars out of five, saying Powderfinger were too careful and not aggressive enough. Powderfinger toured around North America with Coldplay to help promote \"Odyssey Number Five\".\nIn 2003, Powderfinger released their fifth album, \"Vulture Street\". It was named after a street in Brisbane where the band would rehearse. \"Vulture Street\" got to number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, but did not stay on the chart for as long as the two albums before it. \"Vulture Street\" won four ARIA Awards including \"Album of the Year\" in 2003.\n\"Vulture Street\" contained louder guitars and drums than the albums before it, especially \"Odyssey Number Five\". Bernard Zuel from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said it was \"a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album\". Some of the album was recorded during jam sessions, and was similar to what Powderfinger sounded like when playing live. Kenneth Nguyen from \"The Age\" said the band \"play a crowd-pleasing set\".\nBreak from recording.\nIn 2004, Powderfinger released a CD/DVD of themselves playing a concert in Sydney. The release was called \"These Days: Live in Concert\". After this they released a \"best of\" album called \"Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994\u20132000\". This included singles from their albums so far, some songs that were not released as singles but appeared on albums, and two new songs. Both compilations did well on the ARIA Albums Chart, reaching number two.\nAfter releasing \"Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994\u20132000\", Powderfinger said they would have a rest from working together. During this break, Bernard Fanning made his own music, releasing an album called \"Tea &amp; Sympathy\". Darren Middleton released an album, called \"The Way Out\" with Drag, another band he plays in. Ian Haug and John Collins made a band called The Predators during this time with Steven Bishop, who had left Powderfinger around 1992. The Predators made an EP called \"Pick Up the Pace\".\nDuring the break, Fanning married his girlfriend, Andrea. The wives of Middleton and Haug both had children during the break.\nReturn from break.\nPowderfinger returned from their break and began work on their sixth album in 2006. The band recorded in Los Angeles with Rob Schnapf, and released \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\" in 2007. The album's name came from a book called \"The Brooklyn Follies\" that Fanning was reading when the band recorded. \"Dream Days at the Hotel Existence\" contained songs about politics and the lives of Indigenous Australians, and also about love. Because of the political lyrics on one song, \"Black Tears\", the album was nearly banned.\nThe album sold well and was number one in Australia, like many of Powderfinger's previous albums. However, critics did not like it as much as the band's older work; Barnaby Smith of musicOMH said \"the volume has been turned down\", but he said that was \"not always a good thing\".\nAfter the album was released, Powderfinger went on a concert tour with Silverchair, another Australian band. On the tour, called the Across the Great Divide tour, the band played shows in lots of cities in Australia and New Zealand. They did the tour to help Reconciliation Australia, an Australian charity that tries to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians.\nPhilanthropy.\nPowderfinger have done a lot of work for charities and philanthropic causes. In 2004, the band played at WaveAid, a concert in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The concert made over $2 million in profit, which was donated to help survivors of the earthquake.\nThe 2007 Across the Great Divide tour featured Powderfinger and Silverchair playing concerts across Australia to help promote Reconciliation Australia, a charity that tries to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. More than 200,000 saw the bands play. After the tour, the bands released a DVD, which included the bands performing, and interviews with their members.\nIn October 2007, Powderfinger played a concert at the Sydney Opera House as part of \"Breast Cancer Awareness Month\". Only people who had breast cancer, and their families, were invited to the show. Silverchair and Missy Higgins also performed. After the concert, Fanning said that \"musicians have a guilty conscience in general about their lives being quite good and tend to be aware of social issues\".\nDiscography.\nA dash (\u2013) means it did not appear on the chart."}

They also wrote down facts about who told each story. Some of the stories were retold many times before they were written down, and some stories did not agree in every detail resulting in the detailed study of hadith by scholars to compare between those hadith.\nMuslim scholars collected all of these Hadith in books and compared them to each other. They decided which Hadith were most likely to be true records of the Sunnah, that is, the words and actions of Muhammad. Muslims see the Sunnah as an important source of guidance, along with the Qur'an. Islam is the complete religion so nothing could be changed about it. It gives a complete code of life."}

It is the most common sort of monarchy, and is the form used by almost all of the world's monarchies today. \nTypes of Hereditary monarchy.\nHereditary monarchy.\nIn a hereditary monarchy, all the monarchs come from the same family, and the crown is passed down from one member of the family to another. The hereditary system can be more stable, and can command loyalty, but at other times has seen great bloodshed over the question of succession.\nWhen the king or queen of a hereditary monarchy dies or quits the throne (abdicates), the crown is generally passed to one of his or her children, often to the oldest. When that child dies, the crown will be then passed to his or her child, or, if he or she has no child, to a sister, brother, niece, nephew, cousin, or some other relative. Hereditary monarchies most usually arrange the succession by a law that creates an order of succession. This way, it is known beforehand who will be the next monarch.\nNowadays, the order of succession in hereditary monarchies is often based on the idea of primogeniture (oldest born), but there have been other methods that were much more common in the past.\nSuccession.\nIn the past, there were differences in systems of succession, often depending on whether only men can succeed, or whether both men and women could succeed. \nAgnatic succession.\nAgnatic succession means women are not allowed to succeed, or pass the succession from their fathers to their children. \"Agnates\" are relatives who have a common ancestor in an unbroken male line, from father to father. \nCognatic succession.\nCognatic succession means both men and women can succeed. Women usually are only allowed succeed if there is no male in the family. For example, in the United Kingdom, Princess Anne comes after her younger brothers (and her nephews and nieces) in the line of succession. \nIn the 1970s, Sweden changed from agnatic succession to \"fully-cognatic\" succession. This means the line of succession is based on age, not sex. This meant that when Princess Victoria of Sweden was born, she could never become queen, and when her younger brother was born he became \"crown prince\" (heir to the throne) -- but then the law changed, and Victoria became crown princess.\nElective monarchy.\nAn elective monarchy can sometimes seem to be a hereditary monarch. For example, only members of one family may be allowed to be elected; or before the monarch dies, they might have his chosen heir (son, daughter, brother, sister, or other relative) elected.\nIn Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was an elective monarchy, but for many hundreds of years, only the head of the Habsburg family was elected. In 1806, the Holy Roman Emperor abolished the empire and instead became the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, a hereditary monarch.\nThe only true example of an elective monarchy today is Malaysia, where a ruling Sultan of a Malaysian state, is elected as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for a term of five years."}

It is 70 miles (112\u00a0km) long, it stretches from Stockport, Greater Manchester, and ends at Liverpool Bay, Merseyside. For centuries, it formed part of the ancient county divide between Lancashire and Cheshire.\nCourse.\nThe Mersey is formed from three tributaries: the River Etherow, the River Goyt and the River Tame. The modern accepted start of the Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport, Greater Manchester. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start a few miles up the Goyt; for example the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica states \"It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream.\"\nEnvironment.\nWater quality in the River Mersey has been severely affected by industrialisation.\nBut Salmon are now found in the river. They can be viewed on the Salmon Steps at Woolston between the months of September and November.\nIn popular culture.\nThe river is now internationally famous thanks to the music of the 1960s known as Merseybeat and its strong association with Liverpool, which produced songs such as \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\".\nAlso, Paul McCartney's 2007 song \"That Was Me\", from his album \"Memory Almost Full\" mentions merseybeating with the band."}

A guitar may look the same as a Stratocaster, but if it is not produced by Fender or Squier it is called a strat copy. \nFender Stratocaster copies are mostly very cheap and low quality, but some guitar builders make high quality clones of the Stratocaster. Fender makes Stratocasters made in the United States of America, which are largely thought to be the highest quality. However they also make Stratocasters which are made in Japan, but only sell them to the Japanese. Many people view these guitars comparable and even superior to the American made Fenders.\nStratocasters are also made in Korea and sold as special editions. The cheapest Fenders are made in Mexico, but despite their price, these Stratocasters are very good quality guitars compared to the copies which are usually made in China.

Limited editions like the Pro Tone series and some early (1982-1986) Japanese models fetch prices from $400 \u2013 $800 depending on condition.

This is the same with the regions of Belgium. Their status changed once they came under the influence of a ruler. This single ruler then centralised their administration. They then became provinces of a larger state. In total there are 17 provinces today. From these unified Netherlands, seven northern provinces formed the Republic of the Seven United Provinces in the 16th century. These were Holland, Zeeland, Gelderland, Utrecht, Friesland, Overijssel and Groningen. The Republic's lands also included Drenthe (one of the 17, but without the autonomous status of the others), and parts of Brabant, Limburg and Flanders, which were considered to be \"conquered lands\" and were governed directly by the \"Staten-Generaal\", the parliament. From this came their name Generality Lands. They were called \"Staats-Brabant\", \"Staats-Limburg\" and \"Staats-Vlaanderen\", meaning \"of the state\". Each of these \"Netherlands\" had a high degree of autonomy. They co-operated with each other mainly on defense and on the international level in general. They kept to their own affairs elsewhere.\nOn January 1, 1796, during the Batavian Republic, Drenthe and Staats-Brabant became the eighth and ninth provinces of the Netherlands; the latter known as \"Bataafs Brabant\", Batavian Brabant, changing its name to \"Noord Brabant\", North Brabant, in 1815 when it became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This kingdom also contained (then) South Brabant, a province in Belgium. This new unified state featured the provinces in their modern form. Today, they are non-autonomous subdivisions of the national state. There are again numbering 17 provinces, though not all are the same as the 16th century ones. In 1839, with the independence of Belgium, the original single province of Limburg was divided between the two countries. Each country now has a province called Limburg. A year later, Holland, the largest and most populous of the Dutch provinces, was also split into two provinces for a total of 11. The 12th member was to be Flevoland, a province consisting almost entirely of reclaimed land, established on January 1, 1986.\nThe Departments of the French Period.\nDuring the Batavian Republic, the Netherlands were from 1798 to 1801 completely reorganised into 8 new departments, most named after rivers, inspired by the French revolutionary example, in an attempt to do away with the old autonomous provincial status. They are listed below, with their capitals and the territory of the former provinces they mostly incorporated:\n \nAfter only three years, following a coup d'\u00e9tat, the borders of the former provinces were restored, though not their autonomous status. They were now also called \"departments\" and Drenthe was added to Overijssel. In 1806 the Kingdom of Holland replaced the republic to further French interests. It was during this administration that Holland was first split in two, with the department of \"Amstelland\" to the north and that of \"Maasland\" to the south. East Frisia, then as now in Germany, was added to the kingdom as a department in 1807 and Drenthe split off again making a total of 11 departments.\nWhen the Netherlands finally did become fully part of France in 1810, the departments of the kingdom and their borders were largely maintained, with some joined together. They were however nearly all renamed, again mainly after rivers, though the names differed from their Batavian counterparts. Following are their names and the modern day province they corresponded for the most part to:\n \nWith the defeat and withdrawal of the French in 1813, the old provinces and their names were re-established, Holland was reunited and East-Frisia went its separate way. The 17 provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands were for a significant part based on the former French departments and their borders, in particular in what would later become Belgium."}

The metropolitan boroughs and London boroughs got some of the powers of the former institutions, but others went to central government. At the time of the Act, one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties.\nThe act established a system of joint-boards to take over some of the functions of the abolished councils in the metropolitan counties and in Greater London. The joint-boards had councillors appointed by the boroughs. \nThe Act was passed by Margaret Thatcher's government after a series of disputes between the councils and the central government."}

It replaced the earlier London County Council (LCC) which had covered a much smaller area.\nCreation.\nThe Labour Party had controlled the LCC from 1934 and by the 1950s the Conservative Government considered that elections were becoming one-sided, since the London County Council (LCC) covered only the inner (generally Labour-voting) districts. The government sought to create a new body covering all of London.\nAbolition.\nLivingstone's high-spend socialist policies put the GLC into direct conflict with Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government. Livingstone soon became a thorn in the side of the sitting Tory government. He deliberately antagonised Mrs. Thatcher through a series of actions (including posting a billboard of London's rising unemployment figures on the side of, and endorsing a statue of Nelson Mandela whilst Thatcher regarded the future South African president as a terrorist.\nBy 1983, Thatcher was determined to crush both Livingstone and the GLC, and the Cabinet agreed \"in principle\" to abolish the GLC and give its functions to the boroughs. \nThe Local Government Act 1985, which abolished the GLC, faced considerable opposition from many quarters but was narrowly passed in Parliament, setting the end of the council for 31 March 1986.\nReplacement.\nAfter its abolition, London was left as the only major city in the world without a central administrative body. Most of the powers of the GLC were given to the London boroughs. Some powers, such as the fire service, were taken over by joint boards made up of councillors appointed by the boroughs - see waste authorities in Greater London for an example. In total, around 100 organisations were responsible for service delivery in Greater London.\nIt was argued by many people that this situation was chaotic and un-coordinated and a new London-wide body was needed to co-ordinate the whole city. \nTony Blair's Labour government was elected in 1997, and was committed to bring back London-wide government. In 1999 a referendum was held on the establishment of a new London authority and elected mayor, which was approved by a two to one margin. \nThe new Greater London Authority (GLA) was established in 2000. The GLA has a very different structure to the GLC, it consisted of a directly elected Mayor of London and a London Assembly. The Mayor of London elections were won by the same Ken Livingstone, who began his victory speech with the words: \"As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago\"."}

He is considered \"the Father of Chicago blues\". He is also the actual father of blues musician Big Bill Morganfield. Muddy Waters is considered to be one of the greatest bluesmen of all time, and in 2004 he was ranked #17 in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\nLife.\nMuddy Waters was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi. He liked playing in a creek near his home so his sister gave him the nickname \"Muddy Waters\". His mother died and he grew up at his grandmothers home in Clarksdale. He learned to play the harp and played together with other musicans in juke joints and for parties. While he was working as tractor driver at the Stovall plantation he was recorded by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress. Two songs (\"Country Blues/I Be's Troubled\") were put on a record for documentary reasons. The first release of these recordings was 1993 by MCA Records. (\"The Complete Plantation Recordings\")\n1943 Waters went, like a lot of other musicans from the Mississippi delta, north to Chicago. He worked in a papermill and played and got a reputation as musican. To be louder than the visitors of the crowded clubs he changed the acoustic guitar for an electric guitar. Until 1948 he recorded for some minor labels amongst others with Sunnyland Slim, a pianist. Sunnyland Slim took him along as he recorded for Aristocrat Records. There he had the chance to record two sides(\"Gypsy Woman/Little Annie Mae\"). They were not successful but he had the chance to record again. He recorded \"I Can't Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\", which were successful in the Chicago area. With his own band he recorded now and had success. Hits from the beginning of the 1950s were \"Louisiana Blues\" (1951), \"Long Distance Call\" (1951), \"Still A Fool\" (1951) and\" She Moves Me\" (1952).\nThe 1950s were commercially and artistically successful. He became the \"King of the Chicago Blues\". A lot of musicians who played in his band later were stars of the blues scene themself. (Otis Spann, Little Walter, Junior Wells, Big Walter Horton, James Cotton...). Willie Dixon, who played the bass and produced for Chess Records, wrote a lot of his hits from this time.(\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\" (1954), \"Just Make Love To Me\" (1954), \"Mannish Boy\" (1955), \"Trouble No More\" (1956) ) Muddy Waters also played outside the USA. 1958 he played some concerts in Great Britain with Chris Barber. 1960 he played at the Newport Jazz Festival, the first time it was possible for a white audience to hear him.\nAs a recording artist the 1960s were not good. But the white audience even in Europe discovered him. A band from London was named after one of his songs. (\"The Rolling Stones\"). His importance for young musicans was documented in the album \"Fathers and Sons\" where Muddy Waters, the father, played together with his sons Mike Bloomfield, Paul Butterfield and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, all of them white. In the 1970s he tightend his reputation as live act. He played great festivals like the Montreux Jazz Festival. But also his albums were acclaimed, so the album \"Hard again\". This album was produced by the guitarist Johnny Winter.\nOn April 30, 1983 Muddy Waters died in his sleep from Heart Failure, at his home in Westmont, Illinois.\nInfluence.\nUnlike T-Bone Walker, who also used an electric guitar, Waters used riffs consisting of only few accords. This was model for later guitarist. A lot of his songs was covered by other great musicians. The music was used in movies (especially in longtime fan Martin Scorsese's movies, including The Color of Money, Casino and Goodfellas). Even commercials used them.\nSelected discography.\nSelected albums.\nMuddy Waters released about thirty albums during his career, including compilation albums. \n The following lists most of the albums released during his career and the more recent and available compilations released after his death.\nSelected singles.\nMuddy Waters released approximately sixty singles (120 \"sides\") during his career, sixteen of which made the charts. The chart position is the highest in the Billboard Rhythm and Blues charts.\nAwards and recognitions.\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed four songs of Muddy Waters of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.\nInductions.\nU.S. Postage Stamp"}

{"id": "66263", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66263", "title": "Suit (clothing)", "text": "A suit is a set of clothing intended to be worn together. It may be a semi-formal 'lounge suit' or 'business suit'. It always includes a jacket and trousers (pants). In classical gentlemen's tailoring, a waistcoat (U.S: vest) is usually worn with single-breasted suits.\nIn formal or semi-formal wear, the suit is worn with various other items. Quality socks, leather lace-up shoes, and a tie are essential: if a tie is not worn, that is casual wear. This outfit is worn in many countries by men in professional jobs such as business, law, and politics. It is also sometimes worn by women and in such cases a dress skirt or tailored trousers are worn.\nA suit can be part of a dress code, a set of rules that say what people should wear at an event. Ideally, a suit is tailored to the individual wearer. 'Off-the-peg' suits are much cheaper, but they may need adjusting by a tailor.\nSpecial suits for special dangers include space suits and diving suits.\nSocial aspects.\nAs a general guide, dress is more formal in northern Europe and the eastern United States, especially New York. More relaxed styles are found in warmer climates such as southern Europe and the western United States. The main differences are the tie, which is rarely worn in warmer climes, and the colours, which tend to be brighter in warmer climes.\nThe suit has become the standard dress in international politics and business. This applies to almost all countries. The exceptions are countries whose leaders wish to make a \"statement\". By that is meant, they want to underline their difference by making a non-verbal show of independence. Examples would be people of high status from the Middle East or from some African countries.\nAnother angle is cost. Suits are expensive, because to fit well they need to be tailored. Ordinary people wear them less today than fifty years ago, and this is one of the main reasons. They are semi-formal clothing, good for wearing to the office, but not so good for watching a football match. A trend towards informal dress started in the 1960s and 1970s, and has changed the way many people dress. All the same, high-status men do still wear suits. They \"say\" something about the wearer, or so it is thought.\nOrigin.\nThe evolution of the suit began with changes made to formal English male dress by Beau Brummell in the early 1800s. More changes were made later in the 19th century by tailors in London and elsewhere. By the end of that century photographs show men wearing suits that are almost the same as those worn today."}

It began in the Netherlands in 2000.\nFormat.\n\"Deal or No Deal\" involves a contestant, a host/presenter, a banker, and a number of briefcases (or boxes), with each having a different (and initially unknown) value. Each game starts with the contestant selecting one of the cases\u2013this first case's value is not known until the game ends. During the rest of the game, the contestant opens the rest of the cases, one at a time, revealing its value. Each time after a specified number of cases are opened, the banker offers the contestant a certain amount of money to end the game. If the contestant takes an offer, the game ends, otherwise the contestant ends up with the money from the first case.\nSince the range of possible values for cases is known at the start of each game, how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what cases have been eliminated. To promote suspense and lengthen games, the banker's offer usually strays from the expected value dictated by probability theory, particularly early in the game. However it is not uncommon for the bank's offer to exceed the player's expected value very late in the game.\nWorldwide, the largest amount offer (in terms of exchange rates) was \u20ac1,495,000 (equal to $1,737,250) on the original \"Miljoenenjacht\", on November 13, 2005 (which was accepted, the contestant's case only had \u20ac1,000).

The LCC was the largest, most significant and ambitious municipal authority of its day. \nHistory.\nThe creation of the LCC in 1889, as part of the Local Government Act 1888, was forced by a succession of scandals involving the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), its predecessor, which had not been directly elected. While the Conservative government of the day would have preferred not to create a single body covering the whole of London, their election promise to the Liberal Unionists led them to this policy. A later Government created the 28 metropolitan boroughs as lower tier authorities to replace the various local authorities in 1899; they assumed some powers of the LCC and shared others.\nThe LCC inherited the powers of its predecessor the MBW, but also had wider authority over matters such as education, city planning and council housing. It took over the functions of the London School Board in 1903, and Dr C W Kimmins was appointed chief inspector of the education department in 1904. "}

It can also show what people believe is happening in a place or time where it is impossible to know what really happens. \nThere are research institutions just devoted to simulations, like, e.g., \"The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation\" or NEES.\nSimulations are used for many purposes, because in a simulation things can be controlled that might not be easy to control in real life. They can use smaller versions of an object or system for testing or practice. Smaller versions of things, like space ships or rooms, can simulate the real thing. They can also be safer, in place of a thing that is dangerous, like when astronauts practice in a swimming pool rather than in outer space. Astronauts practiced in simulations of the moon before they went and landed there. They use simulations of spaceships that move the way real spaceships do. Simulations often use computers. Computers are used to make simulations of what a spaceship's route might be on the way to the moon, to help plan the mission.\nVideo games.\nOne type of video game is called \"simulator games\". These games let the player simulate doing different things. For example, in the game \"Theme Hospital\", players perform simulated surgery. \"SimCity\" lets players design and build their own simulated city. "}

The greatest diversity one can find in the Mediterranean region. Many brooms (though not all) are fire-climax species, adapted to regular stand-replacing fires which kill the above-ground parts of the plants, but create conditions for regrowth from the roots and also for germination of stored seeds in the soil.\nThe most familiar is common broom, that grows in northwestern Europe. One can find it in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. Like most brooms, it has apparently leafless stems that in spring and summer are covered with golden-yellow flowers. In late summer, its pea-pod like seed capsules burst open, often with an audible pop, spreading seed from the parent plant. It makes a shrub about 1\u20133m tall, rarely to 4m. It is also the hardiest broom, tolerating temperatures down to about -25\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe brooms belong to the subfamily Faboideae of the legume family Fabaceae, mainly in the three genera Chamaecytisus, Cytisus and Genista, but also in five other small genera (see box, right). All genera in this group are from the tribe Genisteae (syn. Cytiseae). These genera are all closely related and share similar characteristics of dense, slender green stems and very small leaves, adaptations to dry growing conditions. Most of the species have yellow flowers, but a few have white, orange, red, pink or purple flowers.\nFolklore.\nA traditional rhyme from Sussex says: \"Sweep the house with blossed broom in May/sweep the head of the household away.\" Despite this, it was also common to include a decorated bundle of broom at weddings. Ashes of broom were used to treat dropsy, while its strong smell was said to be able to tame wild horses and dogs."}

It consists of stiff fibres attached to, and roughly parallel to, a cylindrical handle, the broomstick. In the context of witchcraft, \"broomstick\" is likely to refer to the broom as a whole. A smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster.\nHistory of broom design.\nBrooms have changed very much in their construction, since they developed from ad-hoc use of branches and bundles of several natural fibres. Originally, all brooms were round, a shape that is easy to construct but inefficient for actually sweeping. Brooms could be attached to a handle, either short for a whisk broom, or long for a broom used to sweep the floor or fireplace. The word for the tool was originally \"besom\", \"broom\" simply being the material of which it was normally made. The fibres used in modern brooms are from broom corn. They are long, straight, durable, and bound together in the plant. The newest major change is the \"flat broom\", invented by the Shakers in the 1800s, which has far more width for pushing dirt and nearly all brooms produced today are flat brooms.\nBrooms and witchcraft.\nBrooms have long been connected with witchcraft, almost universally portrayed as medieval-style round brooms and associated with female witches. Despite the association with women, in 1453, the first known case of claiming to have flown on a broomstick is recorded, confessed by the male witch Guillaume Edelin."}

It is among the largest estuaries in the United Kingdom. It is listed as a Ramsar site as being an important wetland area.\nGeography.\nThe Wash looks on the map like a large bite out of the coastline of eastern England. It separates the curved coast of East Anglia from Lincolnshire. It is formed by a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles, each about 25 kilometres (15 miles) in length. All the eastern coast of the Wash is in Norfolk, and goes from Hunstanton in the north to the mouth of the River Great Ouse at King's Lynn in the south. The coast on the opposite side goes from Gibraltar Point to the mouth of the River Welland and is all in Lincolnshire. The southern coast goes roughly northwest-southeast, joining these two river mouths. In the middle is the mouth of a third river, the River Nene.\nHistorical story.\nThe most famous thing that people remember about the Wash is that \"King John lost his crown in the Wash\". This is because, according to reports from the time, King John travelled from Spalding in Lincolnshire to Bishop's Lynn, in Norfolk in the year 1216. He became ill and decided to go back. While he took the longer route through Wisbech, he sent his luggage, including his crown jewels, along the seashore and across the mouth of the Wellstream where the water was not deep. This route was only safe when the tide was low. The horse-drawn wagons moved too slowly for the incoming tide, and many were lost. The whole area at the time was an extensive wetland known as The Fens, which was later drained. It is close to sea level."}

There are about 350 different species of thyme. They are herbaceous plants and sub-shrubs. They can grow to about 40\u00a0cm tall. They are the family Lamiaceae and native to Europe, North Africa and Asia.\nThe stems are usually narrow, sometimes even wiry. The leaves are evergreen in most species. They are arranged in opposite pairs, oval, entire, and small, 4\u201320\u00a0mm long. The flowers are in dense terminal heads, with an uneven calyx, with the upper lip three-lobed, and the lower cleft; the corolla is tubular, 4\u201310\u00a0mm long, and white, pink or purple.\n\"Thymus\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including \"Chionodes distinctella\" and \"Coleophora\" species.\nHistory.\nAncient Egyptians used thyme for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples. They believed that thyme was a source of courage. It was thought that the spread of thyme throughout Europe was thanks to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms. In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed under pillows. This was done to help sleep and ward off nightmares. (Huxley 1992). In this period, women would also often give knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves. People believed it would bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life.\nCultivation.\nThyme is widely grown as a herb. Usually it is grown for its strong flavour, which is due to its content of thymol.\nThyme likes a hot sunny location with good-draining soil. It is planted in the spring and later grows as a perennial. It can be propagated by seed, cuttings, or by dividing rooted sections of the plant. It tolerates drought well.\nThyme keeps its flavour on drying better than many other herbs.\nCulinary use.\nThyme is widely used for cooking. Thyme is a basic ingredient in French and Italian cuisines, and in those derived from them. It is also widely used in Caribbean cuisine.\nThyme is often used to flavour meats, soups and stews. It has a particular affinity to and is often used as a primary flavour with lamb, tomatoes and eggs.\nThyme, while flavourful, does not overpower and blends well with other herbs and spices. In French cuisine, along with bay and parsley it is a common component of the \"bouquet garni\", and of \"herbes de Provence\". In some Middle Eastern countries, the condiment \"za'atar\" contains thyme as a vital ingredient.\nThyme is sold both fresh and dried. The fresh form is more flavourful but also less convenient; storage life is rarely more than a week. While summer-seasonal, fresh thyme is often available year-round. Fresh thyme is commonly sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig is a single stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters (\"leaves\") spaced \u00bd to 1\" apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or teaspoon. If the recipe does not specify fresh or dried, assume that it means fresh.\nThyme retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs. Dried, and especially powdered thyme occupies less space than fresh, so less of it is required when substituted in a recipe. As with bay, thyme is slow to release its flavours so it is usually added early in the cooking process.\nMedicinal use.\nThe essential oil of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) is made up of 20-55% thymol. Thymol, an antiseptic, is the main active ingredient in Listerine mouthwash. Before the advent of modern antibiotics, it was used to medicate bandages. It has also been shown to be effective against the fungus that commonly infects toenails.\nA tea made by infusing the herb in water can be used for cough and bronchitis. Medicinally thyme is used for respiratory infections. Because it is antiseptic, thyme boiled in water and cooled is very effective against inflammation of the throat. The inflammation will normally disappear in 2 \u2013 5 days. Other infections and wounds can be dripped with thyme.\nIn traditional Jamaican childbirth practice, thyme tea is given to the mother after delivery of the baby. Its oxytocin-like effect causes uterine contractions and more rapid delivery of the placenta but this was said by Sheila Kitzinger to cause an increased prevalence of retained placenta.\nImportant species.\n\"Thymus vulgaris\" (common thyme or garden thyme) is a commonly used culinary herb. It also has medicinal uses. Common thyme is a Mediterranean perennial which is best suited to well-drained soils and enjoys full sun.\n\"Thymus herba-barona\" (caraway thyme) is used both as a culinary herb and a groundcover, and has a strong caraway scent due to the chemical carvone.\n\"Thymus \u00d7 citriodorus\" (citrus thyme; hybrid \"T. pulegioides\" \u00d7 \"T. vulgaris\") is also a popular culinary herb, with cultivars selected with flavours of various \"Citrus\" fruit (lemon thyme, etc.)\n\"Thymus pseudolanuginosus\" (woolly thyme) is not a culinary herb, but is grown as a ground cover.\n\"Thymus serpyllum\" (wild thyme) is an important nectar source plant for honeybees. All thyme species are nectar sources, but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty, rocky soils in southern Europe (Greece is especially famous for wild thyme honey) and North Africa, as well as in similar landscapes in the Berkshire Mountains and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US.\nCultivars.\nThere are a number of different cultivars of thyme with established or growing popularity, including:"}

It is usually a list, ordered by quantity. It will show the number of times each value appears. For example, if 100 people rate a five-point Likert scale assessing their agreement with a statement on a scale on which 1 denotes strong agreement and 5 strong disagreement, the frequency distribution of their responses might look like:\nThis simple table has two drawbacks. When a variable can take continuous values instead of discrete values or when the number of possible values is too large, the table construction is difficult, if it is not impossible. A slightly different scheme based on the range of values is used in such cases. For example, if we consider the heights of the students in a class, the frequency table might look like below.\nApplications.\nManaging and operating on frequency tabulated data is much simpler than operation on raw data. There are simple algorithms to calculate median, mean (statistics), standard deviation etc. from these tables.\nStatistical hypothesis testing is based on the assessment of differences and similarities between frequency distributions. This assessment involves measures of central tendency or averages, such as the mean and median, and measures of variability or statistical dispersion, such as the standard deviation or variance.\nA frequency distribution is said to be skewed when its mean and median are different. The kurtosis of a frequency distribution is the concentration of scores at the mean, or how peaked the distribution appears if depicted graphically\u2014for example, in a histogram. If the distribution is more peaked than the normal distribution it is said to be leptokurtic; if less peaked it is said to be platykurtic.\nFrequency distributions are also used in frequency analysis to crack codes and refer to the relative frequency of letters in different languages."}

The British Overseas Territories are also referred to as overseas territories of the United Kingdom, UK overseas territories, or when the context is clear, simply the Overseas Territories.\nThe territories of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, though also under the sovereignty of the British Crown, have a slightly different constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom, and are consequently classed as Crown dependencies rather than Overseas Territories.\nTerritories and dependencies are distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations, a voluntary association of former British colonies.\nIn a historical context, colonies should be distinguished from protectorates and protected states, which though under British control, were nominally independent states, whereas colonies were part of the British state. They should also not be confused with Dominions, which, known collectively as \"the Commonwealth\", were independent states, held to be equal in sovereign status to the United Kingdom within the Empire and Commonwealth after the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Crown colonies, such as Hong Kong, were differentiated from other colonies in being administered directly by the Crown, without the degree of local autonomy found in self-governed colonies and other British overseas territories such as Bermuda.\nGovernment.\nHead of State.\nThe head of state in the Overseas Territories is the British monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen's role in the territories is in her role as Queen of the United Kingdom, and not in right of each territory. The Queen appoints a representative in each territory to exercise her executive power.\nGovernment.\nAll the Overseas Territories have their own system of government, and localised laws. The structure of the government appears to be closely correlated to the size and political development of the territory.\nLegal system.\nEach Overseas Territory has its own legal system independent of the United Kingdom. The legal system is generally based on English common law, with some distinctions for local circumstances. Each territory has its own Attorney General, and court system. For the smaller territories, the UK may appoint a UK-based lawyer or judge to work on legal cases. This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes and where it is impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island."}

However, before these concerts started there had for many years been promenade concerts in the parks of London. These concerts took place in the leisure gardens (parks) where people could walk about while listening to the music (French se promener = to walk).\nPeople had to pay to go into the leisure gardens. There were lots of entertainments there, e.g. fireworks, dancing, acrobatics and music. The music was played by orchestras. Sometimes these orchestras played in bandstands, sometimes in proper buildings.\nVauxhall Gardens and Ranelagh Gardens were the most famous of these gardens. The composer George Frideric Handel had his music played there in the 18th century. The gardens were very fashionable until the 19th century. Aristocratic people, royalty and ordinary people all mixed there. Handel's \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" was performed in Vauxhall Gardens to celebrate the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. The composer Dr Thomas Arne was appointed composer of Vauxhall Gardens in 1745. It was here that many of his songs became popular, including \"Rule Britannia\". Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn performed in Ranelagh Gardens on their visits to London. \nIn the 19th century concerts of classical music became very popular. The conductor Louis Antoine Jullien conducted many concerts. His orchestra were even joined by the bands of the Royal Artillery or drummers from the French National Guard. Concerts were also given in Crystal Palace, the huge glass building which was built for the Great Exhibition in 1851.\nMany English composers had their music played in these parks. The music was often long songs (ballads), or drinking songs. Sometimes choirs sang choruses from oratorios by Handel. Later in the 19th century the programmes included more music by famous composers such as Brahms, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Schumann, Smetana and Wagner.\nIn 1895 Henry Wood started his series of promenade concerts. He wanted to educate audiences so that they liked good music. This series of concerts continues today in the Royal Albert Hall as the BBC Proms."}

Wanting to find out more about her mother, and to become an otome like her, Arika walks to Garderobe (a school in Windbloom for training otomes). She meets a girl called Nina Wang, who is from Garderobe.\nArika is from the countryside, so she does not know much about the city of Windbloom. Nina soon becomes angry with Arika's clumsiness. When Arika tells Nina that she also wants to find Garderobe to become an otome, like Nina, Nina does not agree to tell her where Garderobe is, because she thought that Arika was not good enough to be an otome.\nThey save a girl who is called Mashiro from some men, and Mashiro leads Nina and Arika to Garderobe in return. But they are attacked by a robot called a Slave monster. Nina then makes a temporary contract with Mashiro to protect her, so that she can prove that she was a good otome. Arika finds this very interesting, when the Slave Monster defeats Nina.\nThey all run to a plane, and Arika's necklace shines, making the plane fly by itself. Nina sees the necklace and thinks that she might be Rena Searrs's daughter. A Five Pillar called Shizuru and an otome called Akane saves them, and leads them to Garderobe. Arika thinks that the otomes are good, and asks the headmaster of Garderobe, Natsuki, that she wants to become an otome as well. Natsuki agrees.\nPersonality.\nArika is very cheerful, and seems to be a good potential for an otome, because she is strong. For example, when she saves Mashiro with Nina, she attacks the men with skill. When the nanomachine is put to her so that she can fight with Nina later on, she does not get tired easily. Her power might have come from her mother, Rena Searrs, who was a very strong otome.\nBut when she sometimes does not understand what is happening, she cries easily, but hides it from the others. She always tries to listen to what her grandmother said before she died. For example, the grandmother once said to her \"never to give up hope in a dream,\" so she does not give up her dream to become an otome.\nMeaning of name.\n\"Arika\" in Japanese means a \"place\". \"Yume\" in her surname, Yumemiya, means \"dream\". Together, it means that Arika's dream is to become an otome, and she tries to find a place (Garderobe) where she can have her dreams come true."}

He was born in Billstown, Arkansas. Almost all of his solo works have been in the country music genre. Before his solo career, he played guitar on rock and pop music records, including \"Mary, Mary\" by The Monkees. Campbell joined The Beach Boys for a short time, when Brian Wilson became ill.\nCampbell guest-starred on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\". Later he hosted a series of his own, \"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour\".\nCampbell's hits include \"Galveston\", \"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\", \"Try a Little Kindness\", \"Gentle On My Mind\", \"Sunflower\", and \"Hey Little One\". Many of his hits were written by Jimmy Webb. In 1975, Campbell had his biggest hit, \"Rhinestone Cowboy\". The song became a phenomenon, and rhinestone-covered clothing became a fad.\nCampbell had more hits, including \"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L. A.)\" and \"Can You Fool?\". His career slowed down in the late 1970s. He seemed to suffer from public overexposure. His romance with Tanya Tucker, a much younger country singer, did not help the way many people saw Campbell. He stopped recording, and cut back on his public appearances.\nYears later, Campbell returned to recording and appearing on television. In the 1990s, people were again interested in his music and career. Personal problems, though, seemed to get as much attention as his career, for example, when Campbell was arrested for drunk driving. His music is still popular with fans, and is part of popular culture.\nCampbell discovered in late 2010 that he had Alzheimer's disease. He announced the diagnosis in June 2011. He released his final album that year. He completed his last concert tour in November 2012. He died of the disease on August 8, 2017 in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 81."}

It was composed in 1941. It is a very long work, lasting about 75 minutes. The symphony was first performed by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra on 5 March 1942. Shostakovich was awarded a Stalin Prize by the Soviet government for the symphony.\nHistory of its composition.\nShostakovich gave the symphony its title because it is about what was happening in Leningrad in 1941. It was during the World War II and the German army had invaded the Soviet Union and blocked communication between the city of Leningrad (now called St Petersburg) and the rest of the world. Conditions were terrible: the people hardly had any food to eat and they were very cold in the winter. About a million people died during the siege. \nShostakovich lived in fear most of his life because if Josef Stalin, the Soviet dictator, did not like his music he could have been sent to prison or put to death. Sometimes Shostakovich was made a hero by the government and sometimes he was told that his music was not good because it was not in the style that the government thought he should write it in. The symphony was very popular at first in countries that fought on the same side as Russia in World War II, as well as in Russia. It was performed many times in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many people in these countries liked the symphony because it seemed to show the Russians as heroes fighting to save their city from the Germans. Later, during the Cold War, many people in these same countries did not like the work very much, because the Russians were now their enemies and they thought that music written there was propaganda meant to show Russia and its leaders as better than other countries and their leaders. In more recent years, people have once more changed their minds about the meaning of the music. The music is now thought by some people who study music to show how cruel Stalin was as well as the terror of the Nazi invasion. Other people still think it was meant to support the Russian government and army as they fought the Germans, and to remember the people who died fighting.\nOne of the reasons it is so hard to know what the symphony means is that people disagree about when Shostakovich started writing it. If he started it before the war began, it is probably at least partly about the Soviet government, but if he started it during the war, it might be only about the war.\nAfter the first performance on 5 March 1942 in Kuyb\u00efshev (now called Samara), it was soon performed in Moscow, and then in Leningrad, which was still surrounded by the German army at the time. A copy of the music was out to the West on microfilm. It was performed by Sir Henry Wood in London at the BBC studios on 22 June and the next week at a Promenade Concert. On 19 July it was played in New York by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini in a studio concert played on the radio throughout the United States.\nThe Music.\nThe work has four movements:\nThe first movement is a long, dramatic movement. The middle part of this movement is a march, with a repeated rhythm on the snare drum, starting very softly, with the tune first heard in the strings who are playing \"pizzicato\" (plucking the string instead of playing with the bow). Each time the tune is played it becomes louder. People used to think that this theme was about the invading German Nazi army, but now some people think it might instead be about the way the Soviet government changed the city of Leningrad, or about both of these things. The second movement is called a scherzo. It is a more light-hearted movement after the tension of the first movement. The third movement is slow and full of strong emotions. The composer said that it was supposed to show the city of Leningrad at sunset. The last movement is faster again, and brings back parts of the music from earlier in the piece, but it is not clear whether the ending is serious or not.\nThe orchestra is very large and has parts for the flute, piccolo, oboe, cor anglais, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, French horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba, piano, harp, violin, viola, cello, and double bass, as well as many percussion instruments."}

{"id": "66498", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66498", "title": "Decimal", "text": "The decimal numeral system is the most usual way of writing numbers. It has ten as a starting point, or base. It is sometimes called the base ten or denary numeral system. The word \"decimal\" is also used instead of the word \"period\" to mean the dot (\".\") that is sometimes used to separate the positions of the numbers in this system. Indeed, the dot is the default decimal separator in English-speaking countries.\nDecimal notation.\nDecimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system, which uses various symbols (called digits) for no more than ten distinct values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to represent any numbers, no matter how large. These digits are often used with a decimal separator(such as \".\" or \",\"), which indicates the start of a fractional part, and with one of the sign symbols + (positive) or \u2212 (negative) in front of the numerals to indicate sign.\nThere are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization: the Chinese counting rods system and Hindu-Arabic numeral system. Both required no more than ten symbols, while other numeral systems, such as Babylonian base-60 system, require more symbols.\nOther rational numbers.\nAny rational number can be expressed as a unique decimal expansion. It may have to end with recurring decimals.\nTen is the product of the first and third prime numbers, is one greater than the square of the second prime number, and is one less than the fifth prime number. This leads to plenty of simple decimal fractions:\nNatural languages.\nA straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as \"ten-one\" and 23 as \"two-ten-three\", is found in Chinese languages except Wu, and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities. Japanese, Korean, and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for teens and decades.\nIncan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as \"ten with one\" and 23 as \"two-ten with three\".\nSome psychologists suggest irregularities of numerals in a language may hinder children's counting ability ."}
{"id": "66499", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66499", "title": "Numeral system", "text": "A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a way to write numbers. Roman numerals and tally marks are examples. \"11\" usually means eleven, but if the numeral system is binary, then \"11\" means three.\nA numeral is a symbol or group of symbols, or a word in a natural language that represents a number. Numerals differ from numbers just as the word \"rock\" differs from a real rock. The symbols \"11\", \"eleven\" and \"XI\" are different numerals, all representing the same number. This article tries to explain the different systems of numerals. Greek numerals and Roman numerals are among the systems that were long used, before the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system largely replaced them.\nBases.\nVarious symbols are used as numerals to make numbers. A system with base 10 (the normal decimal system), normally uses the symbols \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", and \"9\". The numbers 0 to 9 can be written as one symbol, \"0\" ... \"9\". To count past 9, symbols have to be put together. \"10\" can be seen as \"1\" in the tens' place and \"0\" in the ones' place, or as \"1 times 101 plus 0 times 100\". With a base of 2, only the symbols \"0\" and \"1\" are used. \"10\" in base 2 notation is therefore \"1 times 21 plus 0 times 20\". This is the same as 2, in the base 10 notation.\nFor bases bigger than 10, capital letters are used as symbols.\nFor example, the hexadecimal numeral system (base 16) uses the numerical digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\nToday, mainly base 10 is in use. Computers use binary and people who study computers often use octal and hexadecimal numeral systems. Ancient Sumer used sexagesimal (base 60). Mesoamerica used base 20. \nMost electronic calculations are done in binary (base 2), but most people do calculations in decimal (base ten)."}

{"id": "66536", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66536", "title": "Touchscreen", "text": "A touchscreen is a computer screen that can be used by touching it with a finger or a stylus pen, instead of using a mouse and keyboard. It can be described as a touchpad with a screen built-in to it.\nToday, all kinds of devices, both big and small, make use of touchscreens. However, tablet computers and smartphones have made them popular and are the most widely known and used products that use touchscreens.\nHistory.\nIn 1965, E.A Johnson of England\u2019s Royal Radar Establishment, invented the first touchscreen that was used in the U.K for air traffic control up until around 1995. The first resistive touch screen was invented by G. Samuel Hurst in 1975, and produced in 1982. Back in 1970, Hurst and nine friends discovered that a touchscreen on a computer monitor made for an excellent method of interaction. Pressure on the cover sheet allowed voltage to flow between the X wires and the Y wires, which could be measured to indicate coordinates. This discovery helped found what we today refer to as resistive touch technology (because it responds purely to pressure rather than electrical conductivity, working with both a stylus and a finger). \nMuch later in 2005, three friends from France created a multi-touch screen capable of tracking any numbers of fingers. By 2005, their company named JazzMutant released the Lemur, a music controller with a multi-touch screen interface. This new technology helped influenced the TactaPad also made in 2005. Two years later, in January 2007, the iPhone was released, which was controlled entirely by a multi-touch screen. It, and the iPad which came out in September 2010, were very successful and would eventually lead to more companies adding touchscreens to their products. They included Samsung, Sony, Motorola, and many companies who adopted the touch-friendly Android operating system.\nIn response to the popularity of touchscreens, Microsoft, maker of the Windows family of operating systems for personal computers, would introduce a new interface in Windows 8 in 2011, which has large tiles that are meant to be easily usable with touch technology like those on tablets. It would come out the next year, along with the Microsoft Surface tablet.\nUsage.\nBecause of how easy they are to use, touchscreens can be found in many places. Along with general computing and consumer electronics devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and personal computers, touchscreens are also widely used on kiosks, which are used for information systems in cities and museums. They are also found on machines including Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), cash registers and retail point-of-sale terminals, GPS navigation systems such as those in cars and other vehicles, medical equipment and industrial control panels. The touchscreen built into kiosks use simple point and click interaction. Interactive whiteboards, which can be found in many schools, also use a simple form of touch technology.\nTypes.\nDifferent kinds of touchscreens work in different ways. There are two main technologies used for touchscreens:\nUnlike resistive screens, capacitive screens don\u2019t work if you touch them with a plastic stylus because the plastic acts as an insulator. Some stylus pens, such as the Apple Pencil for the iPad Pro, are made to work with capacitive screens. They are pressure sensitive and let you to do different things by pushing harder or more gently. For example, you can draw a wider or narrower line in programs like Microsoft OneNote and Adobe Photoshop."}

His story is found mostly in the 5th century historian Moses Khorenatsi's book \"History of Armenia\".\nHistory.\nAccording to Moses Khorenatsi, Hayk is the son of Torgom (Togarmah), the son of Gomer, the son of Japheth. Hayk is also called the founder of the Haykazuni dynasty. According to the historian Juansher, Hayk \"was prince of the seven brothers and stood in service to the giant Nimrod (Nebrovt') who first ruled the entire world as king.\"\nHayk is also the name of the constellation Orion in the Armenian Bible (Job 38:31)\nAccording to Moses Khorenatsi, after Hayk the son of Torgom became father to Armeneak while living in Babylon, because the arrogant Titan Bel (who is Nimrod, according to Moses) has made himself king of the world, Hayk moves with his family and 300 others to the land of Ararat, and starts a village called \"Haykashen\". On the way, he leaves one area for his grandson, Cadmus. Bel sends one of his sons to give Hayk a message, saying that he must return to Babylon, but Hayk answers that he will not. Then Bel marches against him with a great army, but Cadmus warns Hayk that he is coming. Hayk gathers his own army on the shore of Lake Van and tells them they must either defeat Bel or die trying, so they will not become his slaves.\nAfter that, he finds Bel's army on a mountain. Moses says this mountain is found at Dastakert. Bel himself is seen in front of his army. In the middle of the battle, Hayk kills Bel with a lucky arrow and Bel's army becomes confused and defeated.\nAccording to other writers, this battle was fought at Dyutsaznamart around Julamerk, southeast of Lake Van, in the year 2501 BC. Hayk builds a castle called \"Haykaberd\" and the village of Haykashen. He names the country where the battle was fought \"Hayk\" after himself, and today the name of Armenia is called \"Hayastan\" and the Armenian people are called \"Hay\", in their language. Also, in the ancient writings of the Hittites, there was a country called Hayasa in the area."}

{"id": "66592", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66592", "title": "Gerry Adams", "text": "Gerard \"Gerry\" Adams () (born 6 October, 1948 in Belfast, Northern Ireland) is an Irish politician who was the president of Sinn F\u00e9in, a political party that wants Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland. He was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast and was a member of the British Parliament for Belfast West. He does not go to Parliament because he does not believe that Britain should control Northern Ireland, this is called abstentionism.\nAdams is a spokesman for the \"Irish republican movement\" or the \"Provisional movement\". This includes Sinn F\u00e9in and the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). The IRA is illegal in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, because it is called a terrorist group by both governments. Adams is thought to have persuaded the IRA to give up its \"war\" against the UK in return for devolved government for Northern Ireland.\nFrom the late 1980s, Adams was an important figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, started when he met first the SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party\u2019s) leader John Hume and later the Irish and British governments, and then other parties. In 1995 the IRA stopped fighting, and in 2005 the IRA said the war was over.\nAdams retired from politics in February 2020.\nBackground.\nGerry Adams was born in West Belfast. He has 4 brothers and 5 sisters.\nHis parents, Gerry Adams Sr. and Annie Hannaway, came from strong republican backgrounds. Adams's grandfather, also named Gerry Adams, had been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) during the Irish War of Independence. Two of Adams's uncles, Dominic and Patrick Adams, had been interned (jailed without a trial) by the governments in Belfast and Dublin. His uncle Dominic was a senior figure in the IRA of the mid-1940s, but not the chief of staff as some people say. Gerry Sr. joined the IRA when he was sixteen.\nAdams's mother\u2019s grandfather, Michael Hannaway, was a member of the Fenians during their dynamiting campaign in England in the 1860s and 1870s. Michael's son, Billy, was election agent for \u00c9amon de Valera in 1918 in West Belfast but refused to follow de Valera into democratic and constitutional politics upon the formation of Fianna F\u00e1il. Annie Hannaway was a member of Cumann na mBan, the women's branch of the IRA. Three of her brothers (Alfie, Liam, and Tommy) were also IRA members.\nEarly republican career.\nIn the late 1960s, a civil rights campaign started in Northern Ireland, to get equal treatment for Roman Catholics Adams was an active supporter and joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967. Instead of leading to change, the civil rights movement there were protests counter-demonstrators called Loyalists. In August 1969 there was rioting in Northern Ireland\u2019s big cities of Belfast and Derry, and the Government of Northern Ireland asked for the British army to help keep control.\nThis is when the IRA and its political counterpart in Sinn F\u00e9in, restarted. Gerry Adams was active in Sinn F\u00e9in at this time. In 1970 the republican movement (that is the peaceful politicians and the fighters like the IRA who all want the United Kingdom not to control Northern Ireland) split. Adams aligned himself with the active \"Provisional\" part based in Belfast. The \"Official\" part based in Dublin was not interested in fighting for people in Belfast, and the \"Official\" Sinn F\u00e9in was more interested in spreading Marxism rather than making Ireland united.\nIn August 1971, internment without trial was introduced in Northern Ireland. Adams was arrested in March 1972 and interned HMS Maidstone, but was set free in June to take part in secret talks in London. There was a short-lived truce and some members of the IRA met with William Whitelaw the British government minister in charge of Northern Ireland. The IRA delegation included Sean Mac Stiofain (Chief of Staff), Daithi O'Conaill, Seamus Twomey, Ivor Bell, Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams. The IRA insisted Adams be included in the meeting and he was released from internment to participate. Following the failure of the talks, he helped to plan a bombing campaign in Belfast known as Bloody Friday. He was re-arrested in July 1973 and interned at Long Kesh internment camp, which was later called the Maze Prison. After attempting to escape he was sentenced to imprisonment, which was also served at the Maze.\nDuring the Hunger Strikes of 1981, Adams played an important policy-making role. The hunger strikes saw Sinn F\u00e9in become more important as a political force. In 1983 he was elected president of Sinn F\u00e9in and became the first Sinn F\u00e9in MP elected to the British House of Commons since the 1950s. Following his election (as MP for Belfast West) the British government lifted a ban on him traveling to Britain. In line with Sinn F\u00e9in policy, he refused to sit in the House of Commons.\nOn 14 March 1984, Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt when several Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) gunmen fired about twenty shots into the car in which he was travelling. After the shooting, undercover plain-clothes police officers seized three suspects who were later convicted and sentenced. One of the three was John Gregg. Adams claimed that the British army had prior knowledge of the attack and allowed it to go ahead.\nAlleged IRA membership.\nAdams has often said that he has never been a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). However, several writers and journalists such as Ed Moloney, Richard English, Peter Taylor and Mark Urban have all said Adams was part of the IRA leadership during the 1970s. Adams has called Moloney's claims \"libellous.\"\nPresident of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIn 1978, Gerry Adams became joint-vice-president of Sinn F\u00e9in and he led a challenge to the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership of President Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and joint-Vice President D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill. Others who supported Adams and were from Belfast included Jim Gibney, Tom Hartley, and Danny Morrison. Some say Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh was a more traditional Irish nationalist and that the northern leadership which surrounded Adams wanted to act faster and in different ways if they had to.\nThe 1975 IRA-British truce is often viewed as the event that began the challenge to the original Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in leadership, which was said to be Southern-based and dominated by southerners like \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and \u00d3 Conaill. However, the Chief of Staff of the IRA at the time, Seamus Twomey, was a senior figure from Belfast. Others in the leadership also lived in the North, including Billy McKee from Belfast. Adams was supposed to have become the most senior figure in the IRA Northern Command because he wanted only military action, but during his time in prison, Adams came to thought about his ideas and became more political.\nIt is alleged that \"provisional\" republicanism was founded on its opposition to the communist-inspired \"broad front\" politics of the Cathal Goulding-led Official IRA, but this too is disputed.\nSome of the main reasons that the Provisional IRA was founded in December 1969 and provisional Sinn F\u00e9in was founded in January 1970, was that people like \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, O'Connell, and Billy McKee wanted new political bodies and did not want to work in or with the existing bodies such as the Parliament in London. Another was the failure of the Goulding leadership to defend nationalist areas against attacks by Loyalists and sometimes even the police. At the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis (the Irish words for a party conference or convention) the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin (Leinster House), Belfast (Stormont) and London (Westminster) parliaments, the organizations split into Provisional and Official parts. Gerry Adams, who had joined the Republican Movement in the early 1960s, did not go with the Provisionals until later in 1970.\nEnd of abstentionism.\nRepublicans like Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh said that the only legitimate country in Ireland was the Irish Republic declared in 1916. They said the legal government was the IRA Army Council because the last remaining anti-Anglo-Irish Treaty deputies of the Second D\u00e1il made them the government. (Adams agreed to this idea of republican political legitimacy until quite recently - however in his 2005 speech to the Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis he rejected it.)\nWhen Sinn F\u00e9in any won seats in the British or Irish parliaments they never went to the parliaments. At its 1986 Ard Fheis, Sinn F\u00e9in changed its and constitution to allow its members to sit in the Dublin parliament (Leinster House/D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann). This made Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh lead a small walkout, just as he had done years earlier to create Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in. This minority which still believed in abstentionism, called themselves Republican Sinn F\u00e9in (or Sinn F\u00e9in Poblachtach in Irish), and says that they are the true Sinn F\u00e9in.\nAdams' leadership of Sinn F\u00e9in was supported by a Northern-based group that included Danny Morrison and Martin McGuinness. Adams and others, over time, pointed to Sinn F\u00e9in election wins in the early and mid-1980s, when hunger strikers Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty were elected to the British House of Commons and D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and they pushed to get Sinn F\u00e9in to become more political and less paramilitary. This policy was a success and Adams and McGuinness, and others were elected to the House of Commons, but never attend. Sinn F\u00e9in still abstains from Westminster.\nVoice ban.\nAt this time most ordinary people in Britain knew about Adams because they could not hear him. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher banned radio and television stations from broadcasting his voice. All Irish republican organizations and loyalist terrorist organizations were banned like this, but Adams was the only person important enough to appear regularly on TV. This ban was imposed after the BBC interviewed Martin McGuinness. and the British Government thought that some groups were getting too much publicity.\nA similar ban, known as Section 31, had been the law in the Republic of Ireland since the 1970s. However, media outlets soon found ways around the ban, first by the use of subtitles, and later and more commonly by using actors to read his words over the pictures of him speaking.\nThis ban was made fun of in cartoons and satirical TV shows, notably \"Spitting Image\", and in \"The Day Today\". It was also criticized by freedom of speech organizations worldwide and British media personalities, including BBC Director-General John Birt and BBC foreign editor John Simpson. The ban was lifted by Prime Minister John Major on 17 September 1994.\nMoving into mainstream politics.\nSinn F\u00e9in continued its policy of refusing to sit in the Westminster parliament even after Adams won the Belfast West constituency. He lost his seat to Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in the 1992 general election. However, he easily regained it at the next election in May 1997.\nUnder Adams, Sinn F\u00e9in moved away from being a political voice of the Provisional IRA to becoming a professionally organized political party in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nSDLP leader John Hume MP realized that a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with Adams in 1988. These discussions led to unofficial contacts with the British Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, and with the government of the Republic under Charles Haughey \u2013 although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with \"terrorists\".\nThese talks provided the basis for what was later to be the Belfast Agreement, as well as the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.\nThese negotiations led to the IRA ceasefire in August 1994. The new Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Albert Reynolds had played a key role in the Hume/Adams talks through his Special Advisor Martin Mansergh, thought the ceasefire as permanent. However, the IRA ended its ceasefire because of the slow pace of developments, partly because British prime minister John Major needed the votes of the Ulster Unionist Party in the House of Commons.\nLater there was a new ceasefire, and there were talks between teams from the British and Irish governments, the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP, Sinn F\u00e9in and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organizations, under the chairmanship of former United States Senator Mitchell. The talks produced the Belfast Agreement (also called the \"Good Friday Agreement\" as it was signed on Good Friday, 1998). Under the agreement, structures were created to show that some people on the island of Ireland were Irish and others wanted to be British. A British-Irish Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly were set up.\nArticles 2 and 3 of the Republic's constitution, \"Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann\", which claimed sovereignty over all of Ireland, were reworded, and a power-sharing Executive Committee was provided for. As part of their deal Sinn F\u00e9in agreed to abandon its abstentionist policy regarding a \"six-county parliament\", and took its seats in the new Assembly based at Stormont Sinn F\u00e9in ran the and running the health and social services and the education ministries in the power-sharing government.\nOpponents in Republican Sinn F\u00e9in accused Sinn F\u00e9in of \"selling out\" by agreeing to participate in what is called \"partitionist assemblies\" in the Republic and Northern Ireland. However Gerry Adams insisted that the Belfast Agreement provided a way to make Ireland united by non-violent and legal means, much as Michael Collins had said of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922\nWhen Sinn F\u00e9in came to nominate its two ministers to the Executive Council, the party, like the SDLP and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) did not include its leader among its ministers. (When later the SDLP chose a new leader, it selected one of its ministers, Mark Durkan, who then opted to remain a minister.)\nAdams remains the President of Sinn F\u00e9in, with Caoimhgh\u00edn \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in serving as Sinn F\u00e9in parliamentary leader in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and Martin McGuinness the party's chief negotiator and effective party head in the Northern Ireland Assembly. His son, Gearoid is a primary school teacher and has represented County Antrim in gaelic football.\nOn 8 March 2007 it was Adams was re-elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nOn 26 March 2007, he met with DUP leader Ian Paisley face-to-face for the first time, and the two came to an agreement regarding the return of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland."}

{"id": "66619", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66619", "title": "Intelligent design", "text": "Intelligent design is the theory that life, or the universe, cannot have arisen by chance and was designed and created by some intelligent entity. It believes that the universe is so complex that it must have been designed by a higher intelligent being. This theory is that life did not evolve by natural selection. \nIntelligent design was developed by a group of American creationists to get around legal judgements like Edwards v. Aguillard, which said that creationism could not be taught in schools because of the First Amendment. The first use of the term in this form was in the creationist textbook \"Of Pandas and People\", published in 1989.\nConcepts.\nIntelligent design suggests that life is too complex to have evolved. Scientists have discovered that even a single cell is complex. The genes in a cell code have a huge amount of information. Therefore that information, like computer programming, has to come from an intelligent source and cannot be made randomly. This is thought to be because the properties of entropy say things cannot grow in complexity by randomness. Law professor Phillip E. Johnson was seen as the father of the intelligent design.\nIt is also argued that although an amino acid could be made randomly, a protein (a long, shaped string of amino acids) is such a precise sequence and structure that it would be impossible to make by chance. Also, a protein or DNA would not be alive by itself; so a whole life form would have to be made all at once. This argument can be seen as a way of saying that natural selection could not have created life. It is argued whether that is a valid point.\nA common example of this is a bacterial flagellum, which is essentially a microscopic animal version of a very efficient electric motor. The flagellum has lots of separate parts. It is argued that for the flagellum to form by evolution, every single one of the parts would have to be formed together at just the right time. However, scientists say this is not correct. There is evidence that the flagellum developed through evolution.\nA religious philosopher, William Paley, said that life is more complicated than a machine (like as a watch.) He said that just like a watch was made by a smart designer, so were animals. This is known as the watchmaker analogy.\nSimilarities and criticism of Intelligent Design.\nMany parts of different animals are very similar. Intelligent design could show that a common creator used the same good design ideas for all of them. This could be evidence of evolution; but intelligent design suggests that every part of an animal is useful and there for a reason, showing how smart the designer was. \nEvolution suggests that many parts of the same animal would not be useful or not good, because it happened by natural selection. In the past, it was believed that some parts of the human body have no biological function, but later it was proved that some actually do important things.\nIf animals and persons have similar parts because they came from a common ancestor, then the genes that code for these parts should be similar too. Sometimes this is true. But, other times similar structures are coded by entirely different genes, because of convergent evolution. These examples of this kind of different results in data can be used to claim that evolution is either wrong or right, causing arguments."}

The most popular of his books is \"Deen-e-Ilahi\" \"The Religion of God\" (2000) which has recently been republished by Hay House and translated into English, Arabic, Thai, Persian, Hindi and other languages by Messiah Foundation International.\nRAGS International was renamed to Messiah Foundation International in 2000. MFI claims that Shahi is the Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar.\nEarly life.\nShahi was born on 25 November 1941, in the village of Dhok Gohar Shah in the district of Rawalpindi in British India. He is a fifth generation descendant of the Sufi Baba Gohar Ali Shah.\nAt the age of twenty, when he was the owner of F.Q. Steel Industries, Shahi began to search for spirituality. Eventually he became disillusioned in this search and returned to work. Shahi then married and had three children.\nIn 1975, he went to Sehwan Sharif for self-mortification. He spent a period of three years in the mountains of Sehwan Sharif and the forest of Laal Bagh in self-purification.\nCareer as spiritual leader.\nShahi became popular as a Sufi preacher in Pakistan during the later 1970s. He formed \"RAGS International\" and \"Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam\" in 1980. Of the two organisations, RAGS International is still active as Messiah Foundation International whereas Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam was reported to have been dissolved and banned in Pakistan in 2011.\nThe CEO of Messiah Foundation International is Younus AlGohar. Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus Christ in 1997.\nLegal persecution and exile.\nHe and many of his followers have been convicted under Islamic blasphemy by an antiterrorist court in Sindh. After he fled to England, Shahi was convicted \"in absentia\", receiving sentences that totaled approximately 59 years.\nDisappearance.\nShahi was reported to have disappeared in London in 2001; afterwards, sightings of him were reported around the world of people claiming to have met and received spiritual guidance from him.\nIn February 2002, prior to any decision on appeals filed with the Sindh High Court, Ardeshir Cowasjee claimed in an article he wrote for \"Dawn\" newspaper, the Pakistani newspaper, that unnamed people who identified themselves to him as office-bearers of the All-Faith Spiritual Movement told him that Gohar Shahi died abroad, but this report was unconfirmed.\nAfter Shahi's disappearance, his followers largely split into two organisations: the Messiah Foundation International and the Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam. RAGS International was renamed to \"Messiah Foundation International\" shortly after Shahi's disappearance. Its current leader is Younus AlGohar.\nSome sources report his death as of 2001, others as of 2003. According to the \"Pakistani Press Foundation\" Shahi died in 2001 An article from 2006 in the \"Sunday Telegraph\" reports that Shahi died in 2003, and a 2009 article in \"Your Local Guardian\" also says he was reported to have died in 2003. But none of these reports are confirmed as there is no physical proof of his body.\nHowever, the Indian news agency PTI reported in 2008 that Shahi was based in the United Kingdom after being convicted of blasphemy by the Sindh High Court. This view is supported by the \"Indian Express\" which reported in 2008 that Shahi had fled to the United Kingdom and was presently based there. \"Zee News\" also supported this claim. The Hindustan Times has reported that he is \"serving a life sentence\".\nThe Messiah Foundation International claims that he merely disappeared.\nShahi's family, including his wife, five sons and a daughter, still resides in Kotri.\nTeachings and followers.\n\"Main page:\" Messiah Foundation International\nThe teachings of Gohar Shahi have been a source of controversy. Some orthodox theological scholars say his teachings are blasphemous, while others, such as Hisham Kabbani and Sultan-al Awliya Shaykh Mawlana as-Sayyid Khwaja Muhammad Nazim Adil al-Haqqani al-Rabbani al-Qubrusi al-Firdausi an-Naqshbandi have praised him. Hisham Kabbani also sat at the feet of Gohar Shahi.\nClassical singers such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Ghulam Farid Sabri have been presented the message of Shahi, which they have praised. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was quoted as saying \"The message of Hazrat Riaz Gohar Shahi is the greatest message I have ever heard.\" In \"Qawwali\" events in Japan and Germany, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan personally distributed leaflets in favour of Shahi. Aziz Mian has also presented a \"Qawwali\" in praise of Shahi at a \"Jashan-e-Shahi\" event (which celebrates the day Shahi supposedly took the rank of Mehdi by Allah) event.\nClaims and criticism.\nShahi and his followers have made claims that are opposed by some mainstream Islamic theologians in Pakistan and abroad. Shahi was accused of claiming the status of a prophet but Shahi denied such accusations. His teachings have been condemned by Muslim religious leaders and the Pakistani government.\nShahi predicts that the world would end in the year 2026 due to a comet heading towards earth. He claims the comet will be the cause of \"total destruction\" though mentions that \"in order to intimidate [mankind]...God plans destruction on a small scale\".\nMany attempts were made on the lives of Shahi and Younus AlGohar, including a petrol bomb thrown into AlGohar's residence in Manchester where Shahi stayed when he toured the United Kingdom. A man tried to attack him with a hand grenade during a discourse at his home in Kotri, Pakistan. A bounty was put on his head in Pakistan.\nShahi's books have been banned by the government of Pakistan, and his followers are not allowed to meet in public.\nGohar Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus in America. Shahi's supporters claim that his face became prominent on the moon, sun, nebula star and the Black Stone in Mecca, and that these appearances were signs from God that Gohar Shahi is the awaited Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar.\nThe alleged images induced greater legal and religious opposition. Shahi has also supported this claim, saying that God had revealed the images of Shahi on the Moon and various locations, for which Shahi himself was not responsible, and if questions should be raised, they should be raised to God. Messiah Foundation International claims the alleged images to be signs from God, pointing to Shahi being the awaited Mehdi, and quote religious texts as well as sayings from the likes of Nostradamus, and Ja'far al-Sadiq to support it.\nJournalists in Pakistan asked Shahi,\n\"Many believe that you are the Mehdi, and God has revealed signs unto them which say that you are the Mehdi, but you do not officially announce that you are the Mehdi. Why?\" Shahi gestured towards himself and answered, \"Does Imam Mehdi not know the law of Pakistan? He knows that the law of Pakistan declares that 'whosoever claims to be the Mehdi, put him in jail'. I have given the signs of his [Mehdi's] characteristics, which the Mehdi knows and none other. Now, it is up to people to recognize him and believe him\".\nOn 18 November 1997, after appearing in court before Justice Rasheed A. Razvi of Sindh High Court Hyderabad Circuit, Shahi said, \"The only justification to be Hazrat Imam Mehdi is the mark on [one's] back which can prove his existence.\"\nOf the groups following Shahi, Messiah Foundation International claims that Shahi is the awaited Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar while \"Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam\" did not. According to MFI's website, Shahi is the Awaited Messiah, but they deny the notion that Shahi is another form of Jesus and claim that Jesus has also returned to support the Mehdi.\nBibliography.\nGohar Shahi has authored a number of books, including one based on Sufi poetry known as \"Tary\u0101q-e-Qalb\", roughly translating to the \"'Cure of Hearts'\". One of his most prominent books is \"Deen-e-Ilahi\" (\"The Religion of God\"), which is banned in Pakistan.\nWorks by Gohar Shahi include:\nOn May 17th, 2012, Messiah Foundation International republished \"The Religion of God\" with Hay House. As of July 1st, 2012, it was #5 on the publisher's Best Seller's List.\nMessiah Foundation International considers Shahi to be the author of the \"Goharian Philosophy of Divine Love\", a set of principles upon which the organisation is founded. Shahi has also authored a monthly magazine, \"Hatif-e-Mehdi\", which is banned in Pakistan for allegedly containing material offensive to the religious feelings of Muslims there."}

It used to be played by both men and women, but it was restarted by women. There are now a growing number of men's and mixed (or co-ed) teams around the world who are playing roller derby. \nFor a long time, many people did not believe roller derby was a real sport. They thought it was like professional wrestling, because it had fake fighting and other things for TV. But in 2002, a group of women in Austin, Texas started playing it as a real game, with nothing fake. A TV show called \"Rollergirls\" was made about some of these women. By 2006, women in every big city in the USA and Canada were starting their own roller derby clubs. There were even clubs starting up in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.\nHow roller derby is played.\nTwo teams of roller derby players skate around an oval track. The track can be flat or banked (raised around the outer edges).\nThere are 5 players on each team:\nThe jammer is the only player that can score points. The jammer's team gets a point every time the jammer passes one of the other team's players. To score a point, the jammer has to play fair and stay on the track when they pass someone.\nJammers get a 2-minute time period, called a \"jam\", when they can score points.\nBefore a jam starts the blockers of both teams line up side-by-side, with both jammers farther back behind their own starting line. The jam starts when a whistle blows. Then, everyone, including the jammers get to leave their designated areas. The jammers and blockers alike are fighting to get their guy/girl through the pack.\nThe first jammer to get through the pack without leaving the track gets to be the \"lead jammer\". The lead jammer can put her hands on her hips when she wants to stop the jam early. Stopping the jam early keeps the other team from having time to score points.\nBlockers and pivots try to help their own team's jammer get through the pack, and they try to slow down the other team's jammer. When the jammers are near the pack, everyone is allowed to bump into each other. If someone is trying to push someone from the other team out of the way, then they have to be careful how they do it. They can only push from the side, and they have to use their shoulders, the top part of their arms, their hips, or the top part of their legs\u2014so tripping, shoving, punching, or pushing the other team's players from behind is not allowed. Or you will get a penalty \nPlayers who break the rules are sent to the penalty box for thirty seconds, leaving their team stranded on the track without them.\nEven with these rules and safety equipment, roller derby players can get knocked down and get badly hurt, so usually only adults play \"full contact\" roller derby. There are junior clubs for younger players. SOME play without trying to knock anyone down. Others, like the Quad City Orphan Brigade (located in the Quad Cities (Iowa, Illinois)) play FULL contact and TRY to knock others down.\nA roller derby game is called a bout. There are two halves played, which last 30 minutes each. The teams skate as many jams(runs a maximum of 2 minutes per jam) as they can until time runs out. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins."}

He became a prominent member of the royal court of Kish, ultimately overthrowing its king before embarking on the conquest of Mesopotamia.\nThe Empire.\nSargon's vast empire is known to have extended from Elam to the Mediterranean Sea, including Mesopotamia, parts of modern-day Iran and Syria, and possibly parts of Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula. He ruled from a new capital, Akkad, which the Sumerian king list claims he built on the left bank of the Euphrates.

Its location falls in present-day Israel and the Palestinian West Bank.\nHistory.\nAncient Judea.\nJudea was the territory of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. Judea lost its Nationhood to the Romans in the 1st century BC, by becoming first a tributary kingdom, then a province, of the Roman Empire. \nThe first interference of Rome in the region dates from 63 BC, following the end of the Third Mithridatic war. \nAfter the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus, general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome. Judea at the time was not a peaceful place. Queen Alexandra had recently died, and her sons were troubling the country with a civil war for power. They were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. \nIn 63 BC, Aristobulus was surrounded in Jerusalem by his brother's armies, and the situation was bad. He sent a messenger to Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Pompey's representative in the area. Aristobulus offered a large bribe to be rescued, that Pompey quickly accepted, but later, he tried to accuse Scaurus of extortion. This caused his downfall, because Scaurus was Pompey's brother in law and was protected by him. The general did not like what Aristobulus had done, and put the prince and high priest Hyrcanus in charge of the kingdom. Judea and Galilee became tributary kingdoms of Rome, which meant that they had to pay tribute to the Roman Republic to buy their protection. \nAfter Caesar's death.\nAround the same time Pompey was defeated by Julius Caesar, Hyrcanus was followed by a member of his court, Antipater. Caesar and Antipater were both killed in 44 BC, and Herod, Antipater's son, was appointed as governor (\"tetrarch\") by Rome in 41 BC. He became the king (\"basileus\") of Judea in 37 BC, and was known as King Herod the Great. During his reign, the great port of Caesarea Maritima was built. He died in 4 BC, and his kingdom was divided among his sons. One of these was Herod Archelaus, who ruled Judea so badly that he was made to quit in 6 AD by the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, after his own people complained about him. \nThe kingdom of Judea now became part of a larger Roman province of \"Ivdaea\". This was one of the few governed by a knight, not a former consul or \"praetor\" of senatorial rank, because its income to the Roman treasury was small, and the region was peaceful. Pontius Pilate was one of these procurators.\nBetween 41 and 44, Judea won a little more independence again, when Herod Agrippa was made king by emperor Claudius. After Agrippa's died, the province again went to direct Roman control for a short time. Judea was returned little by little to Agrippa's son, Marcus Julius Agrippa, in 48. However, there was still a Roman procurator in the area, responsible for keeping peace and raising taxes. When he died, around the year 100, the area returned once again to direct Roman control.\nRebellions.\nJudea was the stage of three major rebellions against the Romans. They were (see Judea rebellions for a full account):\nAfter Bar Kokhba's revolt was stopped by the Roman forces, the emperor Hadrian changed the name of the province to \"Syria Palaestina\", and Jerusalem became \"Aelia Capitolina\" in order to embarrass the Jewish people by attempting to erase the nation's name from the region.\nMajor cities.\nMajor cities in this area are Hebron, Bethlehem, Efrat and Beitar Illit.

Climate change is now a big problem. Climate change this century and last century is sometimes called global warming, because the surface of the Earth is getting hotter. \nAt times in the past, the temperature was much cooler, with the Ice Age ending about ten thousand years ago. \nOver very large time periods, climate change is caused by variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The Earth has been much warmer and much cooler than it is today.\nIn common use, especially in environmental policy, \"climate change\" usually refers to rapid changes in the climate over recent decades. These climate changes are due primarily to human-caused generation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere (see global warming).\nHistory of climate change studies.\nJoseph Fourier in 1824, Claude Poulliet in 1827 and 1838, Eunace Foote (18191888) in 1856, Irish physicist John Tyndall (1820\u20131893) in 1863 onwards, Svante Arrhenius in 1896, and Guy Stewart Callendar (1898\u20131964) are credited with discovering the importance of CO2 in climate change. Foote's work was not appreciated, and not widely known. Tyndall proved there were other greenhouse gases as well. Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901 invented the term.\nThe Sun.\nThe sun gets a little bit hotter and colder every 11 years. This is called the 11-year sunspot cycle. The change is so small that scientists can barely measure how it affects the temperature of the Earth. If the sun was causing the Earth to warm up, it would warm both the surface and high up in the air. But the air in the upper stratosphere is actually getting colder, so scientists do not think changes in the sun are causing the global warming which is happening now."}

After Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, it is Pennsylvania's third most populous city, with 106,632 residents as of the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Lehigh County.\nThe town is in east Pennsylvania about 45 minutes away from the Pocono Mountains. \nAllentown history.\nFounding.\nThe city of Allentown was first home to people in 1735. It was then named a Northampton town (Northampton-Towne) in 1762 by William Allen, a rich shipping merchant, Chief Justice of the Province of Pennsylvania and mayor, or leader, of Philadelphia in the past. The town was made on a 5,000-acre area Allen got for money in 1735 from the sons of William Penn. Allen hoped that Northampton-Towne would become a commercial center because of it being on the Lehigh River and how it was near Philadelphia. Allen gave the area to his son, James, who built a summer home, Trout Hall, there in 1770.\nOn March 18 1811, the town became a borough. On March 6 1812, Lehigh County was made from the west part of Northampton County, and Northampton was made the county seat. The name of the town became \"Allentown\" on April 16 1833 because it was liked by people. Allentown was made a city on March 12 1867.\nLiberty Bell.\nThe Liberty Bell was kept away from the British during the American Revolutionary War in Allentown. After George Washington lost the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia did not have defense, and got ready for the British to attack. The Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania said that eleven bells, like the State House bell and the bells from Philadelphia's Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, should be taken down and taken away from the city to stop the British, who would melt the bells down to and make into cannons, from taking the bells. The bells were moved north to Northampton-Towne, and put in the basement of the Old Zion Reformed Church, in what is now center of Allentown. Today, a shrine in the church's basement marks the same spot where the Liberty Bell was.\nBirthplace of the American Industrial Revolution.\nBefore the 1830s, Allentown was a small town with only local markets. When the Lehigh Canal was made the economy got bigger. The town changed with industrialization and became one of the United States' biggest areas for big industry and manufacturing. While Allentown was not as big as Bethlehem, the city right next to it, the iron industry in the area still gave many jobs to the city. Railroads, like the Lehigh Valley Railroad, were very important to move raw materials and made goods, and made many new jobs.\nAllentown also had a strong tradition in the making of beer and was home to many breweries people knew, like the Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978).\nEarly 20th century to present.\nEconomic recovery in the early 20th century was caused by the silk and textile industry. The Adelaide Silk Mill, which was one of the biggest mills in the world, opened in Allentown in 1881. By 1928, there were more than 140 silk and textile mills in the Lehigh Valley which made silk the second biggest industry. By the 1930s, the silk industry was getting slow in all the world because synthetics were taking the place of silk. Catoir Silk Mill, the last silk mill in Allentown, closed in 1989. In 1905, Mack Trucks moved to Macungie, a small suburb of Allentown, which began Allentown's focus on big industrial manufacturing. Today, Allentown's economy is mostly service industries.\nClimate.\nAllentown's climate is called humid continental. Summers are hot and muggy, fall and spring are mild, and winter is cold. Precipitation is almost spread throughout the year at the same rate. Allentown's weather is affected by the Blue Mountain, a mountain ridge from 1,000 to 1,600\u00a0feet high about 12\u00a0miles north of the city, and South Mountain, a mountain ridge of 500 to 1,000\u00a0feet high that is south of the city."}

It is recommended that all people are given a series of three vaccines over a few months when they are babies to ensure good protection against this virus. However, vaccination only provides 90% protection, it does not completely remove the risk of infection.\nSome people who are infected are able to beat the virus quickly. Many people are infected for life. Usually they have few or no symptoms. Sometimes the liver is damaged severely, causing liver failure. A common symptom of liver failure is jaundice, where the person's skin and eyes turn yellow due to a build-up of body products which would normally be filtered by the liver. Another problem with hepatitis B is that it can cause cancer of the liver.\nBlood tests can find signs that the liver is being damaged. If people have those signs, treatment for hepatitis B can prevent the liver damage caused by the virus. Antiviral medications are given, which prevent the virus from making copies of itself. However, once the virus is in the liver, it is not possible to get rid of the virus completely."}

It can refer to either a mythical figure or to a holiday personification.\nMythology.\nThe May Queen is also known as The Maiden, the goddess of spring, flower bride, queen of the faeries, and the lady of the flowers. The May Queen is a symbol of the stillness of nature around which everything revolves. She stands for purity, strength and the potential for growth, as the plants grow in May. She is one of many personifications of the energy of the earth.\nShe was once also known as Maid Marian in the medieval plays of Robin Hood and of the May Games - she is the young village girl, crowned with blossom, attended by children with garlands and white dresses. Some folklorists have drawn parallels between her and Maia, the Roman Goddess of Springtime, of Growth and Increase whose very name may be the root of \"May\".\nFestivals.\nThe May Queen is a girl (usually a teenage girl from a specific school year) who is selected to ride or walk at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolise purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age groups dance round a May pole celebrating youth and the spring time.\nAccording to popular British folklore, the tradition once had a sinister twist, in that the May Queen was put to death once the festivities were over. The veracity of this belief is difficult to establish, but while in truth it might just be an example of anti-pagan propaganda, frequent associations between May Day rituals, the occult and human sacrifice are still to be found in popular culture today. The Wicker Man, a cult horror film starring Christopher Lee, is a prominent example of this.\nAn Elizabethan account.\nIn 1557, a diarist called Henry Machyn wrote:\n\"The xxx day of May was a goly May-gam in Fanch-chyrchestrett with drumes and gunes and pykes, and ix wordes dyd ryd; and thay had speches evere man, and the morris dansse and the sauden, and a elevant with the castyll, and the sauden and yonge morens with targattes and darttes, and the lord and the lade of the Maye\".\nTranslation: On the 30th May was a jolly May-game in Fenchurch Street (London) with drums and guns and pikes, The Nine Worthies did ride; and they all had speeches, and the morris dance and sultan and a elephant with a castle (saddle in the shape of a castle) and the sultan and young moors with shields and arrows, and the lord and lady of the May\".\nMaintaining the tradition.\nMany areas keep this tradition alive today, most notably the Brentham Garden Suburb, England which hosts it annually. This has the record of the oldest unbroken tradition although the May Queen of All London Festival at Hayes Common in Bromley is a close contender. A May queen is selected from a group of 13 upwards girls by the young dancers. She returns the next year to crown the new May Queen and stays in the procession.\nA May Day celebration held annually in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada has the distinction of being the longest running May Day celebration of its kind in the British Commonwealth. This May Day celebration began in 1870 and is approaching one hundred and forty years of age. Archival film footage of New Westminster's May Day celebrations from 1932-1962 can be seen online at Quest for the Queens ."}

For example, the set \"A\" = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore \"A\" has a cardinality of 3. The cardinality of a set A can also be represented as formula_1. \nTwo sets have the \"same\" (or \"equal\") cardinality if and only if they have the same number of elements, which is the another way of saying that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the two sets. The cardinality of the set \"A\" is \"less than or equal to\" the cardinality of set \"B\" if and only if there is an injective function from \"A\" to \"B\". The cardinality of the set \"B\" is \"greater than or equal to\" the cardinality of set \"A\" if and only if there is an injective function from \"A\" to \"B\". \nThe \"cardinality\" of a set is only one way of giving a number to the \"size\" of a set. The concept of measure is yet another way. \nFinite sets.\nThe cardinality of a finite set is a natural number. The smallest cardinality is 0. The empty set has cardinality 0. If the cardinality of the set \"A\" is \"n\", then there is a \"next larger\" set with cardinality \"n\"+1 (for example, the set \"A\" \u222a {\"A\"}). If ||\"A\"|| \u2264 ||\"B\"|| \u2264 ||\"A\" \u222a {\"A\"}||, then either ||\"B\"|| = ||\"A\"|| or ||\"B\"|| = ||\"A\" \u222a {\"A\"}||.) There is no largest finite cardinality. \nInfinite sets.\nIf the cardinality of a set is not finite, then the cardinality is infinite.\nAn infinite set is considered countable if they can be listed without missing any (that is, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the set of natural numbers formula_2). Examples include the rational numbers, integers, and natural numbers. Such sets have a cardinality that we call formula_3 (pronounced \"aleph null\", \"aleph naught\" or \"aleph zero\"). Sets such as the real numbers are not countable, since given any finite or infinite list of real numbers, it's always possible to find a number that's not on that list.

In order, from highest to lowest, these are:\nOnly the two highest ranks are knighthoods, and allow the holder to call themselves 'Sir' (male) or 'Dame' (female). If the person is not a citizen of a country where the Queen is Head of State, the award is called honorary, and the holder cannot use the title before their name. For example Terry Wogan became a British citizen and was therefore called Sir Terry Wogan, but Bob Geldof is still an Irish citizen, and is therefore not \"Sir Bob\".

He was born at White Lodge, Richmond Park in London.\nEdward abdicated (resigned) from the throne, because he wanted to marry the American woman Wallis Simpson. Simpson had been married twice before. As King, he was Head of the Church of England, and the Church did not support divorce. After abdicating as king, he was known as His Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor. His wife was not allowed to be called \"Her Royal Highness\".\nEarly life.\nEdward, commonly known by those close to him as David, was born as the first son of the Prince and Princess of Wales, later King George V and Queen Mary. As a young man, he disliked his royal duties, but his charisma made him popular with the British people. Edward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a ceremony at Caernarvon Castle on 13 July 1911 and was even tutored by the future Prime Minister David Lloyd George to speak a few words of Welsh.\nAt the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the twenty-year-old Edward was keen to participate. He witnessed trench warfare at first-hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as possible, but he did not experience as much hardship and misery as ordinary British soldiers.\nEdward undertook a military flight in 1918 and gained a pilot's licence later. Throughout the 1920s, Edward represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. His popularity was at its greatest peak in that decade and gained him much public and media attention.\nHowever, his increasing womanising and reckless behaviour in the 1920s and the 1930s worried Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and his hardworking, strict father, King George V. Edward was also uninterested with royal duties and disliked the British establishment. George V was disappointed by Edward's failure to settle down in life and was furious with his many affairs with married women, and he was reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. George V preferred his son Albert (later King George VI), a family man who was loyal to his beloved wife.\nEdward had a string of relationships with married women including Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, the American wife of a British peer, who later introduced him to Wallis Simpson. She was an American who had been twice divorced. Edward later became Wallis Simpson's lover.\nThat further weakened his poor relationship with his father, who stated, \"After I am dead,\" George said, \"the boy will ruin himself in 12 months\". It took even less time for Edward to cause such a great damage in the royal family that it had not been seen for hundreds of years.\nReign.\nAfter months of ill health, King George V died on 20 January 1936. His son became King Edward VIII and watched the announcement of his new role from a window of St James's Palace with his lover, Wallis. After only a few weeks, Edward began to cause unease in government circles with actions that were seen as too political. He did not work hard as king and was not careful about important state papers. Far from working, in August and September, Edward and Wallis simply sailed around the Mediterranean on a luxury steam yacht.\nOn 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his plans to marry Wallis Simpson after her divorce. Baldwin was unhappy about that and informed him that his subjects would see it as morally unacceptable, because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, which Edward was the formal head, and the people did not like Wallis. Edward knew that the government, led by Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead. That action could have led to a general election and would ruin Edward's status as a politically-neutral monarch. That would be disastrous for the Royal Family and damage the nation.\nAs a result, he chose to abdicate in December of that year and married Wallis later in 1937. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, became King George VI.\nDuke of Windsor and later life.\nAfter his abdication, he was given the title Duke of Windsor. He married Simpson in France on 3 June 1937. His brother and mother did not attend the ceremony. Many people became alarmed with what they thought was Edward's pro German stance. Some even said that he favoured German fascism. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany. Even in the 1960s, Edward privately said to a friend, Lord Kinross, \"I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap\". The Duke and Duchess visited Nazi Germany, against the advice of the British government, and they met Adolf Hitler at his private retreat. During the visit, the Duke gave full Nazi salutes, causing anger in Britain. At the start of the Second World War, the Nazis plotted to persuade the Duke to support the Nazi effort and planned to kidnap him. Lord Caldecote warned Winston Churchill that \"[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue\". More problems arose when Edward gave a \"defeatist\" interview, which angered Churchill even more.\nAfter the war, the Duke and Duchess became celebrities and hosted parties and lived between Paris and New York. In the 1960s, the Duke's health became worse. Because he was a heavy smoker from an early age, he had throat cancer. On 28 May 1972, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th birthday. Wallis Simpson was not strong. She suffered from dementia and died 14 years later. The coffin was buried in the Royal Burial Ground behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Frogmore.\nTitles and styles.\nHis full style as king was \"His Majesty, Edward the Eighth, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland, and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\"."}

To many Christians, the teachings of Arianism are heretical and are not the correct Christian teachings as they deny that Jesus was of the same substance of the God of this monotheistic religion, making it one of the more prominent reasons Arianism has stopped being practiced today. Many may say and have claimed Arianism a powerful part of Christianity from the 4th to the 7th centuries AD however being against fundamental Christian Beliefs, such as that previously mentioned, this rhetoric was opposed by multiple theologians of the era as well as the early church(later Catholic Church). \nArianism simply teaches that Jesus was not God. For this reason, Arianism opposes the dogma of the Holy Trinity. In 325 AD, the Nicene Creed was made, which the early Christians used to defeat Arianism, with the statement: \"We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the \"Son of God\"...begotten, not made, \"consubstantial with\" the Father.\"\nBelief.\nThe main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God. The information that we have today comes from the writing of people who were against Arianism and said the beliefs were wrong. These writings say that Arianism believed:\nBetween the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and the First Council of Constantinople in the year 381 there were no less than 18 different Creeds used by Arianists.\nAntitrinitarianism today.\nIn the 16th century there was again a movement against the belief in the Holy Trinity. Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604) was well known for teaching this as well as Ferenc D\u00e1vid (1510s - 1579). These movements developed into what is called Unitarianism today. Unitarians believe that there is only one person in god, not the three-in-one dogma of trinity. Some of the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses are close to some of the things Arians believed. It is different only in that Arians believed the holy spirit is a person and Jehovah's Witnesses teach it is not a person, but a force God uses to do His will. It would however be false to call them Arians, as they reject many Arian teachings. Mormons and Oneness Pentecostalism also reject the Holy Trinity but for different reasons other than Arianism."}

He was asked by King George II to write the music because the king wanted some music and fireworks to celebrate the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. This was an agreement between a lot of European countries to end the war they had been fighting.\nThe king wanted the celebrations to take place in Green Park in London. He wanted the orchestra to have lots of military instruments such as trumpets and drums and \u201choped there would be no violins\u201d! He wanted the orchestra to have a rehearsal in Vauxhall Gardens to which the public would be able to go. Handel was not very happy with these arrangements, but in the end he agreed.\nThe rehearsal in Vauxhall Gardens took place on 21 April. This was just for the music, there were no fireworks. There were 12,000 people in the audience. The huge crowds caused a three hour traffic jam on London Bridge. The tickets for entrance cost 2s 6d (two shillings and six pence, worth 12 \u00bdp in modern money).\nSix days later the real performance took place in Green Park. The orchestra played in a building which had been specially made. The music was played while the fireworks went off. Unfortunately there was a disaster. The building caught fire when a huge bas relief of the king fell down. However, no one was hurt.\nThe music has five movements: an overture, a Bourr\u00e9e, a movement called La paix (The Peace), La r\u00e9jouissance (The Rejoicing), and two minuets.\nHandel wrote the music for a large orchestra with 24 oboes, 12 bassoons (including a contrabassoon), nine trumpets, nine horns, three pairs of kettledrums, and a number of side drums. On 27 May Handel conducted the music again at a special concert for the Foundling Hospital. This time he used a normal orchestra with string instruments and wind instruments. This is the way it is usually played today."}

It is usually about the personal point of view of the author who wrote it. The definition of an essay is vague. Articles and short stories can be quite similar. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been called essays (e.g. Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" and \"An Essay on Man\"). People that write essays are called essayists.\nMost essays are short. This does not have to be the case. John Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" and Thomas Malthus's \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" are long essays.\nEssays can have all sorts of purposes. For example, an essay can be very argumentative, it can talk about points for and against the essay question to give a balanced argument or opinion. Essay must be essential and give some new points about topics. Its must be useful to readers.\nArgumentative Essay.\nThe argumentative essay is a genre of writing that requires the student to investigate a topic; collect, generate, and evaluate evidence; and establish a position on the topic in a concise manner. The structure of the argumentative essay is held together by coherence, logical arguments, evidential support, and a conclusion. Some examples of argument essay topics are 'Is polygamy evil or not?', 'Are US elections always fair?'\nThesis Essay.\nThis is a genre of essay where a stance is presented in an essay using a thesis statement. A thesis statement is one or more sentence that expresses the main idea of a research paper or essay, such as an expository essay or argumentative essay. It makes a claim, directly answering a question. The thesis statement serves as a guide for the readers throughout the whole entire essay."}

The season started June 1, 2007, and ended on November 30, 2007, but the last storm did not die until December 12, 2007. Most of the storms that form in the Atlantic Ocean during the year happen between these two dates. But Subtropical Storm Andrea formed early on May 9, 2007, which was before the start of the season. This was the second time in five years that a storm formed before the season start date. Tropical Storm Ana in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season also formed before June 1.\nStorms.\nSubtropical Storm Andrea.\nOn May 9, a extratropical cyclone formed into Subtropical Storm Andrea while about 140\u00a0miles (225\u00a0km) southeast of Savannah, Georgia. Tropical storm watches were immediately issued for parts of coastal Georgia and Florida, though were later dropped. It is the first named storm to form in May since Arlene in the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season, and the first pre-season storm since Ana in April 2003. Later, the pattern of the system became bad with a large lowering in convection as it moved over cooler waters, and on May 10 it weakened to a subtropical depression and NHC issued its final advisory on Andrea at 11\u00a0PM EST, May 10. However, on the morning of May 11 convection flared up over the center, indicating that the cyclone might be acquiring tropical characteristics once again. However, it did not.\nThe storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. One surfer drowned in Florida from the rough surf. Five people died during Andrea's initial extratropical phase. High winds from Andrea have been reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia. Andrea was blamed for providing stiff winds that acted like a \"chimney\", fueling the blaze to firestorm levels beyond the control of firefighting officials. Strong winds from the storm spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami.\nTropical Storm Barry.\nOn May 30, a large low pressure area formed in the Gulf of Honduras. The system slowly became stronger as it moved through the northwest Caribbean Sea into the southeast Gulf of Mexico. On June 1, the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season, this cyclone organized into Tropical Storm Barry, even thought it was in an area of high wind shear. Warnings were immediately issued along the Western Florida coastline. Barry gave much-needed rain to parts of Florida and Georgia which were experiencing drought conditions from January to May. Barry made landfall near Tampa Bay, Florida on June 2 as a weak tropical storm. Shortly after, Barry weakened into a tropical depression as it became an extratropical storm. On June 3, the cyclone moved up the coast of the Carolinas bringing rains into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. By June 5 its center had moved northward into Eastern Canada.\nTropical Storm Chantal.\nAn area of low pressure area formed near the Bahamas on July 28, and slowly organized while moving to the north-northeast. Late on July 30, it was upgraded to a tropical depression, the third of the season, after developing deep convection near the center for most of the day. On July 31, the system strengthened into a tropical storm south of Nova Scotia, the first storm in nearly two months after Barry. The storm quickly became extratropical late that day though as it moved towards Newfoundland over the cooler waters of the north Atlantic.\nOn August 1, flooding was reported from Placentia to the capital city of St. John's, where about 100\u00a0mm (4\u00a0inches) of rain held up the annual Royal St. John's Regatta. Up to 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0inches) of rain fell in the Whitbourne area, according to Environment Canada. The most serious flooding was across the southern Avalon Peninsula, where dozens of roads were washed out, houses were flooded above their basements and several communities were isolated. Ferry service between Argentia and North Sydney, Nova Scotia, was stopped, and one ferry was forced to change its course to Port aux Basques.\nStates of emergency were declared in at least five communities in the areas surrounding Placentia Bay and Conception Bay, and the Newfoundland and Labrador Municipal Affairs Minister Jack Byrne has requested a federal disaster area declaration. Damage is estimated to be well into the millions of dollars, with at least $4 million in damage in the town of Placentia alone.\nHurricane Dean.\nA strong tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa in the second week of August. It quickly gathered itself and turned into into a low on August 12. Tropical Depression Four was made on August 13 in the east part of the Atlantic from the tropical wave to the south of Cape Verde. The depression was already having continuing deep thunderstorms, but mostly at the west part of its spinning because of wind shear from the east. The depression was supposed to become stronger a lot over the next few days due to wind shear becoming more weak and warmer sea surface temperatures which made conditions better for it to become stronger. The depression moved west very fast, south of a deep layered high, quickly running away from the shear from the east. Looking at satellite pictures and microwave and QuikSCAT information, the depression was changed to Tropical Storm Dean on August 14. It was changed to a category one then a category two hurricane on August 16, 2007. It got to category three then category four on August 17, 2007. It got to category five on August 20, 2007. Dean made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula as a category 5. The hurricane made another landfall in Mexico on August 22 and Dean died the next day.\nTropical Storm Erin.\nOn August 9, an area of convection developed just south of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure. The system moved west-northwestward, and by August 10 it had a broad surface trough with minimal shower activity. Convection increased on August 11, and by August 12 a tropical wave and an upper-level low began to merge which resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas. Upper-level winds slowly became more beneficial for development, and on August 13 a large low pressure area formed about 90\u00a0miles (145\u00a0km) north-northeast of Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo. Late on August 14, a reconnaissance flight into the system reported a small circulation center, but at the time was not well-defined enough to result in the initiation of tropical cyclone advisories. However, deep convection was found near the increasingly organizing center, and at 0300\u00a0UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center upgraded it as Tropical Depression Five about 425\u00a0miles (685\u00a0km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.\nLooking at reconnaissance info gotten from an NOAA plane investigating the depression, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Erin on August 15.\nIt weakened to a tropical depression as it made landfall near Lamar, Texas, on August 16 and the NHC gave out its last advisory on the system soon after as it moved inland; but the HPC then began taking the responsibility of making advisories as long as the system was still tropical and a flood threat.\nTwo people were killed when a warehouse broke down in Texas. In all, 17 people died because of Erin.\nHurricane Felix.\nOn August 31, an area of weather east of the Windward Islands became strong enough, and was named Tropical Depression Six. Early on September 1, it was changed to a tropical storm and named Felix. Later that day, Felix was changed to a hurricane. On September 2, Felix was changed to a major hurricane. Felix hit land as a category 5 in northeastern Nicaragua, making it the second hurricane in 2007 to do this. At least 133 people were killed.\nTropical Storm Gabrielle.\nAn extratropical storm off the coast of the eastern United States was classified as \"Subtropical Storm Gabrielle\" by the National Hurricane Center late on September 7. It was later reclassified as a tropical storm on September 8. After passing over the Outer Banks of North Carolina, it weakened to a depression on September 10, and the final advisory was issued the next day as it no longer had a well-defined surface circulation.\nGabrielle poured 4-6\u00a0inches of rain in the immediate area of landfall, but reports showed minimal damage and no fatalities were reported.\nTropical Storm Ingrid.\nTropical Depression Eight formed from a tropical wave 1130\u00a0mi (1815\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles on September 12, just before the system that eventually became Humberto formed. It was slow to develop and became Tropical Storm Ingrid early on September 14. Shearing winds from a tropical upper tropospheric trough soon weakened the cyclone, it returned to depression strength on September 15, and the final advisory was issued on September 17 as the system degenerated into an open wave north of the Leeward Islands. Ingrid was the first storm of the 2007 season not to threaten land, and there were no reports of damage or casualties.\nHurricane Humberto.\nTropical Depression Nine formed from a non-tropical low in the north-western Gulf of Mexico on September 12. Three hours later it had strengthened sufficiently to be named Tropical Storm Humberto. It rapidly became a hurricane until dissipating over North Carolina. Damage is at a half a billion dollars.\nTropical Depression Ten.\nAn extratropical low formed off the east coast of Florida on September 18. It slowly tracked westward, breaking itself away from a trough over the Atlantic while crossing the Florida Peninsula on September 19, emerging in the Gulf of Mexico on September 20. It slowly organized itself and was classified as a subtropical depression on the morning of September 21 just south of the Florida Panhandle. Three hours later, it was reclassified as fully tropical. At 8\u00a0pm EDT (0000 UTC) later that day, Tropical Depression Ten began to move onshore, and never reached tropical storm strength.\nDamage from the precursor low was reported in Eustis, Florida from one or more tornadoes that damaged or destroyed about 50 houses, but caused no serious injuries.\nTropical Storm Jerry.\nEarly on September 23, a subtropical depression formed from a previously extratropical low about 1060\u00a0miles (1710\u00a0km) west of the Azores. It quickly strengthened into Subtropical Storm Jerry later that morning while remaining far from land. It transitioned into a fully tropical storm early on September 24, but weakened the same day as it moved over cooler waters. As it accelerated northward, it strengthened back into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) late on September 24. Shortly afterward, Jerry was absorbed into a larger extratropical low.\nHurricane Karen.\nIn the fourth week of September, a very large tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked south of Cape Verde. It slowly became organized, by early on September 25, it became a tropical depression, and 6 hours later was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen. It was slow to become stronger at first, but on September 26, Karen quickly became stronger and was made a hurricane early in the day before added wind shear stopped the intensification and began to slowly weaken the storm. Karen was declared to have been at hurricane strength by the NHC on November 27, 2007.\nHurricane Lorenzo.\nOn September 21, an area of convection developed in the western Caribbean Sea in association with a trough of low pressure. Convection increased and a broad area of low pressure developed on September 22 as the convection moved northwestward towards the Yucatan Peninsula. On September 23 the area of low pressure moved over the Yucatan Peninsula and was producing thunderstorms from the southern Gulf of Mexico to the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Over the next few days the broad area of low pressure was moving erratically over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico but convection remained limited due to strong upper-level winds. By September 25 upper-level winds started to become more favorable for tropical cyclone formation and by that morning visible satellite imagery indicated that a tropical depression could be forming about 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) east of Tampico, Mexico.\nDuring the evening of September 25 a United States Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that the area of low pressure had developed into a tropical depression. The depression tracked slowly to the south and southwest into the Bay of Campeche. On September 26 convection increased and the depression was getting closer to being a tropical storm. At 0300 UTC September 27 the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for parts of the Mexican Gulf Coast as the depression was forecasted to strengthen into a tropical storm. Rapid intensification took place on September 27, and the depression became Tropical Storm Lorenzo around midday. Continued intensification that afternoon brought Lorenzo to near hurricane intensity. Early that evening, less than 7 hours after first being upgraded to a tropical storm, it was upgraded to Hurricane Lorenzo. It hit land on Mexico a little while after.\nTropical Storm Melissa.\nAn area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave near the Cape Verde islands developed into a tropical depression on September 28, after slowly developing for almost two days. Early the next day it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Melissa, the eighth named storm to form in September, tying the record for most storms to form in a month. It soon weakened under the influence of shearing winds.\nTropical Depression Fifteen.\nOn October 11, a tropical depression formed in the central Atlantic east of Bermuda out of a previously non-tropical low, which could possibly have involved the remnants of Tropical Storm Karen. It dissipated without further development.\nHurricane Noel.\nDuring the evening of October 27, a low pressure system that had been slowly developing over the eastern Caribbean gained enough organization to be declared Tropical Depression Sixteen. It steadily intensified and became a tropical storm on the afternoon of October 28. It made landfall in Haiti on October 29, and then meandered across the western Caribbean near Cuba for the next three days. Noel brought torrential rain to the region, killing at least 120 people. It then accelerated northeastward, passing through the Bahamas before strengthening to a hurricane on November 1. Noel began an extratropical transition on November 2. While sustained winds were still at category 1 strength, the NHC issued its final advisory that afternoon. Meanwhile, the Canadian Hurricane Centre is still issuing advisories as it approaches Canadian territory.\nTropical Storm Olga.\nIn the second week of December, after the official end of the hurricane season, a low developed east of the northernmost Lesser Antilles. It slowly acquired subtropical characteristics, and late on December 10, the NHC declared it Subtropical Storm Olga while just north of Puerto Rico. It is the first post-season storm since Tropical Storm Zeta in the 2005 season, making this season one of the few with activity both before and after the official bounds of the hurricane season. The storm made landfall on December 11 on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. Later that evening, Olga transitioned into a tropical storm just after making landfall. Further weakening took place and the storm degenerated into a remnant low late on December 12.\nFlooding and mudslides caused at least 22 deaths - one in Puerto Rico, two in Haiti and at least 19 in the Dominican Republic.\nStorm names.\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in the Atlantic basin in 2007. Due to the devastation caused by Hurricanes Dean, Felix and Noel, these names were retired by the World Meteorological Organization. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2013 season. A storm was named Andrea for the first time in 2007. The list is the same as the 2001 list except for Andrea, Ingrid, and Melissa, which replaced Allison, Iris, and Michelle, respectively. Names that have not been assigned are marked in .\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy.\nThe table on the right shows the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for each storm in the season. ACE is, basically speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34\u00a0knots (39\u00a0mph, 63\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength. While Subtropical Storm Andrea was a named storm of the 2007 season, NOAA does not officially include subtropical storms' ACE ratings in season totals. Andrea's ACE would have been 0.603 104kt\u00b2 if it was tropical. Values accrued while Gabrielle, Jerry and Olga were subtropical are not included in their totals."}

A \"shoot\" generally refers to \"new fresh plant growth\" including both stems and other structures like leaves or flowers.\nThe other main structural axis of plants is the root. In most plants, stems are above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems called stolons or rhizomes.\nStems have four main functions which are:\nThe normal life span of plant cells is one to three years. Much of the longer-lasting tissue in trees consists of cells which are no longer living. Bark and xylem vessels are examples of this.\nSpecialized terms for stems.\nStems are often specialized for storage, asexual reproduction, protection or photosynthesis, including the following: \nStem structure.\nThe most important tissue inside the stem is the vascular tissue. This plays a major part in the transpiration of water and nutrients. There are many hollow tubes, including the xylem vessel and schlerenchyma fibres. The phloem contains living tissue.\nEconomic importance.\nThere are thousands of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugar cane stems are a major source of sugar. Maple sugar is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, bamboo shoots, cactus pads, kohlrabi, and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk.\nCellulose from tree trunks is a food additive in bread, grated Parmesan cheese, and other processed foods. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of \"Acacia senegal\" trees. Chicle, the main ingredient in chewing gum, is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree.\nMedicines obtained from stems include quinine from the bark of cinchona trees, camphor distilled from wood of a tree in the same genus that provides cinnamon, and the muscle relaxant curare from the bark of tropical vines.\nWood is a used in thousands of ways, e.g. buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fence posts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, tool handles, picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, cardboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon.

The Allies of World War II gave up the powers and duties they had had in the two Germanys and in Berlin since the Nazi Surrender in 1945 stopped the fighting in World War II.\nSix countries signed the treaty but only five ratified (confirmed) it. This is because Germany united under one government on 3 October 1990, three weeks after the treaty was signed.\nThe treaty allowed East and West German reunification into one country. It said that Germany will be peaceful, and not start wars. Germany promised to limit the size of its Army, Navy, and Air force, and not to make nuclear bombs. \nThe treaty also set guidelines about moving the foreign troops that were in Germany. The USSR was to move all of its troops out of Eastern Germany and Eastern Berlin by 1994. The three Western allies were asked to keep their troops in Berlin until the Soviets had left. Germany also promised not to allow NATO troops to move into Eastern Germany, and not to allow certain types of weapons in the East either. \nThe treaty also set Germany's borders, and the German government confirmed that the treaty it made with Poland in 1970 about the border between the countries, was to stay in force.\nOn 15 March 1991, the treaty treaty took effect, and Germany became fully sovereign (that is, able to control everything in its own territory, including Berlin)."}

The sugar is made by photosynthesis. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, therefore the name, that comes from the Greek word \u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"phloios\") for \"bark\". \nAphids (greenfly) and other insects feed on the phloem by inserting a fine tube into the plant, penetrating the tiny phloem cells deep within the plant. The high pressure in the phloem tubes forces the phloem sap into the insect. Most of the sugar passes right through the insect, so that nearby surfaces get sticky and often become black due to the growth of fungus.\nWater, which is absorbed by the plant's roots, travels up the stem to the leaf through the xylem. This means that the xylem helps during photosynthesis by bringing water up the plant. It does the same job that blood vessels do in animals."}

Their stems may form runners, called stolons above the ground, or rhizomes below ground. The leaves are green and large, and may bear spores on the underside.

{"id": "67079", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67079", "title": "Rojava", "text": "Rojava, or Western Kurdistan, or Syrian Kurdistan, is a part of divided Kurdistan in the Middle East. It consists of three areas called 'cantons' in Northern Syria but the Syrian government is not in control there. Instead, since a revolution which happened early on in the Syrian Civil War, it has had its own independent government, although it does not claim to be a new independent country, calling itself a 'federal autonomous region' inside of Syria instead.\nMany people in Rojava are Kurds, but there are also many different ethnic groups living there, such as Turkmen, Arabs, Syriacs, Assyrians, and Yezidis. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group in Syria. Before the civil war, many human rights organizations such as Amnesty International said that the Syrian government treated the Kurds very poorly. Kurds in Syria are not allowed to officially use the Kurdish language, and also not allowed to register children with Kurdish names, start businesses that do not have Arabic names, build Kurdish private schools, or publish any books or other materials written in Kurdish. But this is no longer enforced due to the civil war.\nThis gave the Kurds many reasons to support a revolution against the government. They also needed to organize an army to defend themselves from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) which almost took control of Rojava because the government could not defend it due to the civil war. ISIL is still at war with Rojava. As of 2017, there is a truce between Rojava and the Syrian government. The United States have given money and weapons to Rojava to help defeat ISIL but some say that they are supporting ISIL.\nRojava is claiming to be a democracy. It has a constitution which says that women's rights and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities have to be respected. In the Middle East this is very unusual. There are two military organisations one for men, the YPG, and an army for women, the YPJ.\nHistory.\nThe Kurds are the largest ethnic group (\"group of people\") in the world that does not have its own state. The Kurds are traditionally nomadic (\"with no fixed living place\") and live in a region in Asia called Kurdistan. Most of Kurdistan is mountainous. There are parts of Kurdistan in Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and in Syria. There is discussion in academia about the origins (\"start\") and migrations (\"movements of people\") of the Kurds in history. Many other groups have also lived in Kurdistan in the past. The ancestors of modern Kurds probably arrived in Iran in the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. Kurdistan was part of the empire of the Medes, then the Achaemenid Empire, the Seleucid Empire, the Roman and Byzantine empire, and then the Sassanid Empire.\nIn the 7th century AD, the Muslim conquests of the Ancient Near East meant that Kurdistan became part of the Rashidun Empire. The Kurdish tribes (\"social groups\") in Upper Mesopotamia and the western Iranian plateau fought against the attacking armies for a time. Most Kurds became part of the Shafi`ite division of Islam. In the three centuries after this, some Kurds gained some autonomy (\"self-rule\") for their culture and politics, in the time of the Umayyad Caliphate and the following Abbasid Caliphate.\nThe Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty (\"line of rulers\") rose to power in the 10th century, as the power of the Abbasid Caliphate fell. The first Ayyubid ruler was Saladin. He was greatly famous for taking back Jerusalem for the Muslims in the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187. His empire took over much of Syria and the Near East. In 1193, Saladin died and was buried in Damascus, where some of his soldiers then chose to live. The \"Kurdish quarter\" (\"an area in the city\") where these soldiers lived was a place where Kurdish language and culture was in existence into the 20th century. In the 11th century, Krak de Chevaliers, a castle (\"military building made strong against attack\") in the Alawite Mountains, was named \"fortress of the Kurds\" or \"Castle of the Kurds\".\nThe armies of the Mongol Empire attacked Ayyubid Syria in the middle of the 13th century. The Mamluks overcame the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. In the early 16th century, the Mamluks lost control of Syria when the Ottoman Empire overcame them in war.\nSharaf Khan Bidlisi wrote the \"Sharafnama\" in 1596. The \"Sharafnama\" was an epic history of the Kurds from the 13th century to the late 16th century. In the \"Saharfnama\", Sharaf Khan Bidlisi wrote that Kurdistan was the country between the Persian Gulf and the \"vilayets\" (\"local government\" \"areas\") of Malatya and Marash (modern Kahramanmara\u015f). Sharaf Khan Bidlisi thought that the Lurs people were Kurds and that Kurdistan was very large. He wrote that parts of the \"vilayets\" of Diyarbak\u0131r, Mosul, \"Persian Iraq\", \"Arabic Iraq\", Fars Province, Azerbaijan, Lesser Armenia, and Greater Armenia were part of Kurdistan. Ahmad Khani wrote the \"Mem \u00fb Z\u00een\" in 1692. He wrote that Kurdistan was about the same size. Haji Qadir Koyi wrote poetry in the 19th century. He wrote that northern Syria was part of Kurdistan. He also wrote that Kurdistan contained the cities of Nusaybin (ancient Nisibis) and Alexandretta (\u0130skenderun). Alexandretta is a port (\"harbour city\") on the Mediterranean Sea.\nAt the start of the 17th century, the Ottoman Sultans ordered Kurds from different parts of their empire to move to the area around the Euphrates river. These Kurds were told to live on both sides of the river. The western side of the river and the town of Koban\u00ee were where most of these Kurds lived afterwards. In the 18th century, some of these Kurdish people in Greater Syria (also named \"Bilad al-Sham\") kept their Kurdish culture and their relations with Kurds in other parts of Kurdistan. Other Kurdish tribes were assimilated (\"taken in\") by Arab tribes who also lived there. \nFrench Syria (1920\u20131946).\nThe result of World War I (1914\u20141918) was very important for the history of the Kurds. The Triple Entente overcame the Ottoman Empire, and the lands where Kurdish people lived before the war were separated. The lands were cut by the borders belonging to the new countries of Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. In 1916, the United Kingdom and French Third Republic had secretly agreed on how to share the territory in the Near East in the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement. The agreement was used to decide the borders for a long time. This was very influential and important, and stayed in the memory of Kurdish people as a betrayal by imperialism.\nWhen the fighting was completed in World War I and the Arab Revolt, Britain and France suggested a Kurdish state could be set up. However, neither country wanted to pull back their armies from the lands that had been Ottoman (the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration). In late 1919, the French Armed Forces fought their first battle with the Kurds, in the Kurd Mountains. In this campaign (\"military operation\"), the French soldiers soon won victory, but they also had to fight Kurds in al-Jazira, and there they did not succeed so easily.\nThe British and French governments did not want to move their armies back, and because of this they said any Kurdish state would have to be in parts of Kurdistan controlled by Turkey in August 1920, when the Ottomans, British, and French all signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. The Turks did not fully agree to (ratify) this treaty (\"agreement between nations\"), but it would have brought into existence a small independent Kurdistan under French control (suzerainty). This state, which did not become a material fact, would have been without the Kurdish lands in Iraq, Iran, or Syria.\nThe Turkish National Movement led by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and the Kemalists (\"supporters of Atat\u00fcrk\") did not agree to the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. After they fought the Franco-Turkish War, France and Turkey signed the Treaty of Ankara in 1921. This treaty meant that the border between French-controlled Syria and the new Republic of Turkey was moved further south than had been agreed in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Turkey and France both tried to make good relations with tribes in the border area, hoping that they would help to get control over the land.\nIn 1923, Turkey and the great powers (\"most powerful nations\") agreed the Treaty of Lausanne. This treaty meant that no independent Kurdistan or Kurdish state would come into existence. Instead, the Kurdish areas of the old Ottoman Empire were separated by the border between Turkey to the north, and British Iraq and French Syria to the south. The new border between Turkey and Syria was agreed to be the railway line running through the area: the part of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway line that went between the cities of Aleppo and Mosul. The north side of the railway became Turkey, and the south side became French Syria. This meant that Arab areas were left in Turkey and Kurdish areas in Syria. Thomas Schmidinger, a German cultural anthropologist wrote that modern Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan, came into existence as \"a waste product of the colonial division of the Middle East\" south of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway line. From then until the present day, Kurdish people do not see themselves as \"Syrian\" or \"Turkish\". For Kurds in Turkey, Syria is \"below the line\" () on the map, but for Kurds in Syria, Turkey is \"above the line\" ().\nOn the south side of the railway line, in French Syria, some mostly Kurdish areas came under the control of France. These Kurdish areas were around the Kurd Mountains (Kurd-Dagh), around the town of Jarabulus, and the lands in Upper Mesopotamia (the Northern Jazira). They had been given to France after World War I. From the start of French control in Syria, the geography of these separated areas was very important for their later history. According to the historian Jordi Tejel, \"These three Kurdish enclaves constituted\u00a0\u2026 a natural extension of Kurdish territory into Turkey and Iraq\".\nThe new borders meant that the Kurdish people in the area were divided into two groups, with two different governments. However, they were able to come and go across the border: there was at first no material separation. However, events in Turkey had deep effects on Syrian Kurds. Many Kurds ran away from Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s because of repression by the Kemalist government. The Kurds in Turkey rose up against the government in the Sheikh Said rebellion (1925) and the Ararat rebellion (1927\u20131930). These uprisings failed, and after them many Kurds ran away from the Turkish government, coming to live in Syria. The French government in Syria, led by the High Commissioner of the Levant in Beirut, tried to improve the profits from land in the Jazira by making these Kurdish refugees live there. The government hoped to make their control over Syria more popular in France, where the population disliked French colonialism in Syria. France's military operations were made more difficult by propaganda supporting Turkey which the Turks gave to the Kurdish and Arab tribes. There was fighting against the French in the Jazira until 1926.\nThe French government's settlement of Kurdish refugees in the Jazira made Kurdishness a political subject in Syria. By 1927, there were 47 villages in the Jazira whose population had a Kurdish majority. The population of Kurds and the number of Kurdish villages both increased from 1918 to 1939. The Kurds came from outside Syrian Kurdistan, which meant that the Kurdish population in the Jazira increased even more.\nThe brothers Celadet Bedir Khan and Kamuran Al\u00ee Bedirxan started to use the Latin alphabet, which then became normal in Syrian Kurdistan and in Turkish Kurdistan. At the start, French Syria's Kurds mostly spoke Kurmanji, a Kurdish language spoken in the north of Kurdistan. In French Syria, Kurds lived both in the three enclaves of Syrian Kurdistan and outside them, in the rest of Syria. There were large Kurdish populations in the biggest cities (Aleppo and Damascus), and there were also Kurdish nomads (\"people with no fixed living place\") and Yazidi Kurds on the hills of Jabal Sam'an. The Kurds' lands were discontinuous and Kurdish populations were a mixture. Kurdish refugees from Turkish Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan helped the Kurds become active in political work. A political movement of \"pan-Kurdism\" (\"for all the Kurds\") started to come into existence, together with different Kurdish identities.\nIn 1924, Kurdish delegate from the Kurd Mountains made a petition to the French Syrian government, requesting for self-rule in Kurdish-majority lands in French Syria. In 1927, Kurds from Turkish land started Xoyb\u00fbn in Beirut. Xoyb\u00fbn was an important pan-Kurdish political movement making early arguments for Kurdish nationalism. Xoyb\u00fbn supported a military resistance in Turkish Kurdistan, but in French Syria, Xoyb\u00fbn worked for self-rule in Syrian Kurdistan. Xoyb\u00fbn were popular in Syrian Kurdistan and Xoyb\u00fbn delegates were elected from Kurd Dagh, Jarabulus, and the Jazira in the elections of 1931. The French government refused Xoyb\u00fbn's requests for self-rule.In 1936, the French government and the First Syrian Republic made an agreement on Syria's independence from France: the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence. World War II meant that this process was not completed. After the Battle of France, Nazi Germany occupied France, and Syria came under the control of Vichy France. When Syria was captured by the Allies of World War II in 1941's Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign, they accepted the Syrian Republic's independence and sovereignty (\"right\" \"to self-rule\"). Xoyb\u00fbn had worked all through the war, but they disbanded in 1946.\nSyrian Republic (1946\u20131963).\nSyria was given independence in 1946. The Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS) was formed in 1957. They were the first Kurdish national political party in Syria, and worked to better the lives of Syrian Kurds. The KDPS did not request the independence of Syrian Kurdistan, and worked for a \"Syrianized\" agenda.\nOil was discovered in Syrian Kurdistan in the 1960s. At the same time, events in Iraqi Kurdistan meant that the lives of the Kurdish population Syria became much worse. In August 1961, the Syrian government ordered a special census of al-Jazira Province in November that year. By the time the census was done, the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan had risen up to claim self-rule. The census took away Syrian citizenship and civil rights from about 120,000 Kurds in al-Jazira Province. The government decree (\"order\") in August 1961 said that Kurds were \"illegally infiltrating\" from Turkish Kurdistan into Syria, in order to \"destroy its Arab character\". The Kurdish lands in the Kurd Mountains were not changed by this census, and Kurdish people there kept their citizenship and were not made stateless.\nIn 1962 the Syrian government started the Arab Belt plan to \"save Arabism\" and stop the \"Kurdish threat\". The Arab Belt plan was to move the Kurdish population away from the Syria\u2013Turkey border. In the Kurds' place, the government would move more Arabs onto the land. The Kurds would be moved to other parts of Syria, away from one another. The government's decision was made after the discovery of an oil field at Qaratchok, in the Kurdish Jazira. Much of the land in the Arab Belt was fertile arable land (\"for growing crops\") and had rich oil fields. More than half (50\u201360 percent) of all the petroleum in Syria is near Derik in the Jazira.\nSyrian Arab Republic (1963\u20132011).\nThings became worse for the Kurdish population when the ultra-nationalist Ba'ath Party of Michel Aflaq took power by a coup d'\u00e9tat in Damascus in March 1963. In November, the party published a pamphlet named \"Study of the Jezireh Provnce in its National, Social, and Political Aspects\" and written by the al-Jazira Province's chief of police, Mohamed Talab Hilal. Hilal was an Arab nationalist, and said he used \"anthropological\" arguments to \"prove scientifically\" that Kurds \"do not constitute a nation\". He wrote that \"the Kurdish people are a people without history or civilization or language or even definite ethnic origin of their own. Their only characteristics are those shaped by force, destructive power and violence, characteristics which are, by the way, inherent in all mountain populations\". Hilial also wrote in the pamphlet that \"The Kurds live from civilization and history of other nations. They have taken no part in these civilizations or in the history of these nations.\" The Ba'ath Party's pamphlet had twelve plans to Arabize (\"make Arab\") al-Jazira Province. The planned steps were:\nMany of these steps were taken over the following years and the Arab Belt continued to be the government's plan. The 120,000 Kurds of al-Jazira Province whom the government decided were non-Syrians could not get education or health care, and could not marry or vote. They could, however, be conscripted into the Syrian military. They could be sent to fight on the Golan Heights (lands fought over by Syria and Israel). These Kurds were victims of the Arab Belt plan. The government planned to move 140,000 Kurds off their land and move Arabs onto it. In 1966, the government was considering doing the same in the Kurd Mountains. (Like all of Syrian Kurdistan, the Kurd Mountains are on the Syria\u2013Turkey border, and they are to the west of the areas first named as Arab Belt land.) In 1967, the lands of Kurds in al-Jazira Province were nationalized by a law named the \"Plan to establish model state farms in the Jezireh Province\". This was a euphemism for the Arab Belt plan. The Six-Day War meant that the plan was not fully completed. Many of the Kurds did not leave their lands when the government ordered them to do so. In 1975, the Syrian government built forty \"model villages\" in the Arab Belt area, and moved in 7,000 armed Arab peasant families to live in them. The government built the \"model villages\" in an area stretching from Amuda to Derik, with some near Qamishli. The government gave Derik (a Kurdish name) the new Arabic language name \"al-Malikiyah\". Water from the new Lake Assad flooded the lands of Arabs living in the Euphrates valley when Syria built the Tabqa Dam. The Arabs whose lands were flooded were moved to the mostly Kurdish al-Jazira Province.\nThe Ba'athist government moved slowly, in order not to get attention from other countries. The government suppressed Kurdish culture, harassed Kurdish people, and confiscated Kurdish literature and Kurdish music. The government sent people in the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria to jail for years for what the government said were \"anti-Arabist\" crimes. Official government documents in Syria do not mention Kurds or other non-Arab people. There were Kurdish people in the People's Council of Syria (the legislature of Syria), but the official identity was Arab-only for everyone in the Syrian Arab Republic. Between 1965 and 1975, 30,000 Kurds left al-Jazira Province to escape persecution or look for work. According to Kurds, the government took of land away from Kurdish farmers in al-Jazira Province: the government was following Hilal's plan. In the Kurd Mountains, the government's land reforms mostly redistributed land to Kurdish farmers, but in other parts of Syria, the government took many Kurds' lands and gave them to Arabs. Even in the Kurd Mountains, which were outside the lands of the Arab Belt in al-Jazira Province, all schools taught in Arabic language only and Kurdish language was marginalized in public life.\nIn 1976, Hafez al-Assad stopped the Arab Belt plan going any further by not building any more Arab villages. The villages the government had built and the Arabs the government had moved stayed where they were. Kurdish music was again heard and official harassment became less intense. The position of Kurds in Syrian Kurdistan was related to the changing political positions of Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. In 1977, the government changed all Kurdish language place names in the Kurd Mountains to official Arabic language names, as in other parts of Syria. The 120,000 Kurds whose citizenship the Syrian government removed in 1961 \u2013 and all their descendants \u2013 were not given official documents or passports. The government was still conscripting these Kurds into the Syrian military in the 21st century."}

Some of Iranian Kurdistan is in Iran's Kurdistan Province.\nIranian Kurdistan is next to the Iraqi Kurdistan. Further to the west are Turkish Kurdistan and Syrian Kurdistan.\nLand.\nEastern Kurdistan is the name for the western and north-western regions of Iran. Iranian Kurdistan is between the central Zagros Mountains and the north-western international border of Iran. The lands of Kurdistan Province, West Azarbaijan Province, Kermanshah Province, Ilam Province are part of Iranian Kurdistan. The lands in parts of Hamadan Province where people speak Kurdish are also a part of Kurdistan. The area of Iranian Kurdistan is more than .\nThere are important rivers and forests and Kurdistan. At Kermanshah, there is an oil field. Lake Urmia is a salt lake that is the largest lake in Kurdistan. The mountains of Kurdistan have always been important for military strategy. The northern and central Zagros Mountains are where two important trade routes of the Silk Road economic system passed through Iran.\nThe most common crops in all of Kurdistan are cereals and tobacco. The most common livestock in Kurdistan are domestic sheep. Farmers grow strawberries and other fruits in southern Iranian Kurdistan. \nSaqqez can be one of the coldest places in all Kurdistan. It can be in the winter at Saqqez. \nPopulation.\nIran has the second-largest population of Kurds in the world. (Only Turkey has a larger Kurdish population.) Kurds are the third-largest ethnic group in Iran, and only the Persians and Azerbaijani people have larger populations. Iranian Kurdistan is next to Iran's international borders with Turkey, Armenia, and Iraq.\nThere are different estimates of how many Kurds are in Iran. In the \"Routledge Handbook on the Kurds\", scholars write that there are about 7 million Kurds in Iran. The Kurdish population is about one tenth of Iran's whole population. In \"The Kurds: An Encyclopedia\", there scholars write that there are between eight and ten million Kurds in Iran. The Kurdish population is between 11% and 15% of Iran's whole population.\nBetween five and seven million Kurds live in Iranian Kurdistan. Most are Sunni, but about 1.5 million are Shia Kermanshahi Kurds, who have not interest in Kurdistan becoming independent.\nKurds in Khorasan.\nNot all of Iran's Kurds live in Iranian Kurdistan, and many Kurds live in Khorasan Province. There are Kurdish populations in the cities of Khorasan, where there are many Kurdish villages spread over . There may now be about two million Kurds in Khorasan, and many of them speak Kurmanji Kurdish. Most of the Kurds of Khorasan live in villages, but there are also populations in Nishapur, Mashhad, Sabzevar, Quchan, Bojnoord, and Esfarayen.\nHistory.\nIn the past, the land of Kurdistan was in two parts. From the 17th century, one part was inside the Ottoman Empire, and the other part was Iranian Kurdistan. Iranian Kurdistan was inside Iran.\nMany of the Kurds in Khorasan Province are descendants of the tens of thousands of Kurds whom Abbas the Great, the shah of Iran, moved from Iranian Kurdistan to the borders of Afghanistan and the land that is now Turkmenistan. Shah Abbas's government did this between 1598 and 1610. The government had moved many Kurds there in the 16th century, in order to make the Kurds fight against the Uzbek people who were then attacking Iran. \nAfter the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1905\u20131911, the Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan's towns supported the new system of local government, but the Kurdish tribes in the countryside supported the shah (\"the king of Iran\").\nThe armies of the Russian Empire took control of Iranian Kurdistan in World War I, during the Persian Campaign. The February Revolution in Russia meant that the Russian provisional government no longer wanted to control Iranian Kurdistan. Nikolai Baratov, a Russian army general acting for the government, made an agreement with the local Iranian Kurds. They would attack the Ottoman army and help the Russians, and the Russian government would help set up an independent Kurdish state.\nWhen the Ottoman Empire fell apart after World War I, the British Empire and the French Empire took parts of Ottoman Kurdistan. Although the governments in Britain and France said that a Kurdish state could be set up in Turkish Kurdistan, they did not say that Iranian Kurdistan should join it. Britain and France did not want to anger Iran, and they made no plans for Iranian Kurds to be part of a new Kurdish state. Iran kept Iranian Kurdistan.\nAt a Kurdish congress, Sheikh Ubeydullah brought together Kurds from Iranian Kurdistan and Kurds from the parts of Kurdistan in the Ottoman Empire. Sheikh Ubeydullah worked for the unification of Iranian Kurdistan with Ottoman Kurdistan, and for political independence in Kurdistan.\nIran's Islamic Republic stopped letting foreign scholars travel into Iran in the 1980s. Because of this, people outside Iran do not know much about Kurds in Iran or about Iranian Kurdistan.\nThe Iranian government is fighting a slow battle with the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK). The fighting has increased in 2005 and takes place around the Qandil Mountains and the international border with Iraq. The PJAK started as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) from Turkish Kurdistan.\nThe United Nations says that the Iranian government oppresses Kurds in Iran. The Iranian government assassinated Iranian Kurdish leaders living in Europe in the 1980s. Asma Jahangir told the United Nations Human Rights Council that almost half of all the political prisoners in Iran were Kurds. One fifth of all the people executed in Iran during 2016 were Kurds.\nLanguages and writing.\nKurds in Iran speak a number of Kurdish languages. Kurdish language is the most important sign of Kurdish cultural identity in Iran. Kurdish is an Iranian language and an Indo-European language like the Persian language, but people that speak Persian do not understand Kurdish.\nMost Kurds in Iran speak the Sorani dialect. Kurds in the Kurdish cities of Mahabad, Saqqez, Sanandaj, and Marivan speak Sorani. Kurds also speak Sorani in Arbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Kirkuk in nearby Iraqi Kurdistan. In Kermanshah, Kurds speak the Kirmanshani dialect. In the Lorestan area, the Lurs people speak the Luri language. The Luri language has similarities with the Kirmanshani dialect. Kermanshah is next to Lorestan. Around the city of Paveh and some other towns, Kurds speak the Gorani language.\nPoetry is important for Iranian Kurds, because their position is made difficult by the ideology and oppression of Iran. The culture of Iranian Kurdistan is close to Iraqi Kurdistan's culture. Modern Kurdish language poetry in Iranian Kurdistan came from the Kurdish poetry of modern Iraqi Kurdistan and from modern Persian language poetry. The most important poets are Sware Ilkhanizadeh, Fateh Sheikh, Ali Hasaniani and Solayman Chireh. After the Republic of Mahabad fell in 1946, three important Iranian Kurdish poets moved to Iraqi Kurdistan: Abdurrahman Sharafkandi (known as Hazhar); Muhammad Amin Shiekholeslami (known as Hemin); and Khalid Hisami (known as Hedi). Iraqi Kurdish poetry was most important for Iranian Kurdish poets in the 1980s. From the 1990s, newer poets like Azad Rostami and Behzad Kordestani used newer forms in their poetry. Omid Warzandeh, Raza Alipour, Kambiz Karimi, Jalal Malaksha and Saleh Suzani are now among the poets of Iranian Kurdistan.\nSome Iranian Kurdish writers have written novels which are important to Kurdish literature. Writers have published novels in Iraqi Kurdistan as well as in Iranian Kurdistan. Ata Nahayee, Qader Hedayati, Shahram Qawami and Kamran Hamidi are among these writers. Many Iranian Kurds have worked to improve Kurdish culture in Iraqi Kurdistan. In Iraqi Kurdistan, written works by Iranian Kurdish writers are very common. Publishers in Arbil and Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan make Sorani Kurdish translations of works written in other Kurdish dialects.\nMost of the provinces of Iran on the country's international borders (with the inclusion of Iranian Kurdistan) have lower rates of literacy than the average for Iran. Before Iran's Literacy Movement Organization () started, it was mostly madrasas and other Islamic schools that worked for the education of the population in Iranian Kurdistan. These schools did not teach much science or technology, and the teachers taught religion and literature. In Iran, literacy is a synonym for being able to read and write in the Persian language. (Persian is the official language of Iran and the only language used in government schools.) Because of this, many Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan cannot read or write in Kurdish. Many Kurdish children do not learn Kurdish, and tutors and private schools are important in teaching Kurdish language and literature.\nAlthough Iran's constitution makes Persian the only official language, it also makes allowance for other languages to be taught and published as a political right. Until the 21st century however, there was a total ban on Kurdish in schools until the Ministry of Education gave approval to Kurdish language teaching in middle schools. In 2015, the Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology gave its approval to a Bachelor of Arts academic degree programme at Sanandaj's University of Kurdistan.\nThere are Kurdish language magazine and newspapers, and there are local television programmes and radio programmes in some Kurdish dialects.\nReligion.\nMany Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan follow the religion of Yarsanism. About 37 percent of the two million people in Kermanshah Province follow Yarsanism. There may be one million followers of Yarsanism altogether. Around Kermanshah, some Kurds belong to Shia Islam. There are Faili Kurds who belong to Shia Islam in both Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan. Starting in the 1960s, about 150,000 Faili Kurds were sent out of Iraq into Iran. These Faili Kurds could not prove they had citizenship in Iraq because Faili Kurds in the past had not wanted citizenship in the Ottoman Empire.\nBefore the 1950s, there were many Jewish people in Kurdistan. There were 19 Jewish communities in Iranian Kurdistan in 1948. Most Jewish people left Kurdistan after that time, but there is still a population of Jews in Iranian Kurdistan. Iranian Jewish Kurds were more integrated with local people than Jews in the rest of Iran were. In the 1950s, there were 3,000\u20134,000 Jewish Kurds in Iran. Most of the Jews in Iranian Kurdistan lived in the cities of Sanandaj, Kermanshah and Urmia. Many of them were physicians or merchants. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran, many Jews left Iranian Kurdistan.\nThere used to be many Christian people living in the plain around Urmia who belonged to the Assyrian Church of the East. They were in a lower position in society than the Kurds, the Turks, and the Persians. The plain of Urmia is one of the only places in Kurdistan where there is a large Christian population.\nMost Kurds in Khorasan are Shia Muslims."}

It is the lead single from Rihanna's third studio album \"Good Girl Gone Bad\". It was written by Jay-Z, Terius Nash and Christopher Stewart. It was released on March 29, 2007 as a single and digital download. It was very successful worldwide reaching number one in numerous countries. The song is 4 minutes and 35 seconds long.\nBackground and single release.\nThe songwriters of \"Umbrella\" offered the song to a number of labels before Rihanna finally accepted and recorded it. The song was first offered by Britney Spears but she turned it down. Although it was released officially on March 29, 2007, it was released in some parts of the United States on March 28. In the United Kingdom, the single was released as a digital download on May 14 and as a physical single on May 28.\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Umbrella\" was directed by Chris Applebaum on April 13, 2007. It premiered on April 26 at the thisisrihanna.com website. The video was released on May 11, and reached the number one spot for eight weeks.\nThe video features Jay-Z rapping in the beginning while in a rain of sparks. Rihanna is then shown singing in a steamy place. In the first chorus, Rihanna walks around en pointe while in the rain. In the second verse, she is seen dancing with an umbrella in a different place. Later, she is painted silver and posing in several positions while nude. At the end of the video, Rihanna is again dancing with an umbrella while in a shower of sparks falling like rain.\nRemixes.\nA number of remixes were made for the song. Lil' Mama is featured in one remix. Chris Brown performed an answer song with different lyrics, called \"Cinderella.\"\nChart performance.\n\"Umbrella\" reached the number one spot in a number of countries. It topped the charts in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Austria, Belgium, Norway and Switzerland at the same time. It peaked at the top spot in the United Kingdom for ten weeks in a row from May 20 to July 29, 2007. It was the longest running number one song since \"Love Is All Around\" by Wet Wet Wet in 1994 (that song spent 15 weeks). It was knocked off the number one spot in the UK by Timbaland's \"The Way I Are\".\nThe song's reign at number one in the UK happened when the country was hit by extreme rainfall and flooding, which led some people to jokingly suggest the two events were related, calling it the \"Rihanna Curse\". Interestingly in Greece (the single's worst performing market) \"Umbrella\" was released at a time when people were suffering through a summer of several heatwaves topping 45C/113F and the worst forest fires of modern history, killing 60. The song only reached number fourteen in the Greek singles chart. \n\"Umbrella\" was at number one in the American Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and in the Australian ARIA Charts for six weeks."}

They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place.\nPlant cells which are differentiated generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells. This allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant.\nMeristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals. They are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cell division.\nThe cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small. The cytoplasm does not contain plastids (such as chloroplasts, but they are there in rudimentary form ('proplastids'). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.\nApical meristem.\nThe apical meristem, or growing tip, is found in the buds and growing tips of roots in plants.\nIt begins growth of new cells in young seedlings at the tips of roots and shoots (forming buds, among other things). Specifically, an active apical meristem lays down a growing root or shoot behind itself, pushing itself forward. Apical meristems are very small, compared to the cylinder-shaped lateral meristems.\nPrimary meristems.\nApical meristems may differentiate into three kinds of primary meristem:\nThese meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height.\nSecondary meristems.\nThese meristems cause secondary growth, or an increase in width.

As the cork is harvested.\nPortugal produces 50% of cork worldwide. Cork is made up of suberin, a hydrophobic substance.\nIn general, cork is made up of suberin (average of about 40%), lignin (22%), polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) (18%), extractables (15%) and others.\nProperties and uses.\nCork's elasticity together with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers, especially for wine bottles. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork's low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys, as well as handles for fishing rods (as an alternative to neoprene). Cork is also used in the manufacture of musical instruments, particularly woodwind instruments, where it is used to fasten together different segments of the instrument and make the seams airtight. \nSince cork has suberin in its cell walls, this makes the cells consist of sealed elements. And having sealed elements make it greater for acoustic insulation and even thermal insulation. Sealed elements are capable of trapping and absorbing sound. In short, suberin is mostly responsible for noise reduction! Also, lignin is another constituent of cork. It makes up about 22% of cork. One study says that it\u2019s also associated with soundproofing and thermal insulation! \nThe cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly. The sustainability of its production and the easy recycling of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects. \nCork demand has increased due to a larger proportion of wine being sealed with cork rather than being sold in bulk. Top quality corks are quite expensive, so many cheaper brands have switched to lower quality cork, synthetic plastic stoppers, screwcaps, or other closures."}
{"id": "67102", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67102", "title": "Cork oak", "text": "The cork oak (\"Quercus suber\") is a medium-sized, evergreen oak tree. It grows southwest Europe and northwest Africa.\nIt grows to up to 20 m, but in its native environment it is usually not that tall. The leaves are 4\u20137\u00a0cm long, dark green above, paler beneath, with the leaf margins often downcurved. The acorns are 2\u20133\u00a0cm long.\nThe tree forms a thick, corky bark. Over time this bark can develop considerable thickness and this is harvested every 10\u201312 years as cork. The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree and a new layer of cork regrows, making it a renewable resource. The tree is widely cultivated in Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Morocco, France, Italy and Tunisia. Cork oak forests cover approximately 2.5 million hectares in those countries. Portugal accounts for 50% of the world cork harvest. Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for forest management felling of old, unproductive trees.\nCork oaks live about 150\u2013250 years. Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 10\u201312 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested a dozen times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery.\nThe European cork industry produces 340,000 tonnes of cork a year, with a value of \u20ac1.5 billion. 30,000 people work at it. Wine corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.\nCork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees. So they provide a small income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. Hybrids with turkey oak (\"Quercus cerris\") are regular, both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid is known as Lucombe Oak \"Quercus \u00d7 hispanica\".\nSome cork is also produced in eastern Asia from the related Chinese cork oak (\"Quercus variabilis\").\nSeed predation.\nIn many different species of trees seed predation is considered a problem for the continued growth and reproduction of trees, in this case Rabbits are affecting the cork oak tree. During the development of a plant species the seed / acorn stage in development is considered to be the most important yet most vulnerable stage. The cork oak tree encounters many challenges during its seedling stage.\nSeeds are often found in the form of acorns that fall to the ground close by to the base of the tree. Those acorns become the beginning development of new trees, which develop over time. However many different species use those acorns as a source of food. When rabbits are living in the same area as the cork oak tree seed regeneration is not affected in a negative way.\nAn acorn that has partial damage is classified as only having damage to the non-vital parts of the propagule. Therefore, when the acorn embryo is damaged the development of the seed is negatively affected. The affected development causes a difference in shoot and root biomass because the cotyledon is lost. The cotyledon is a necessity of plants and in this case becomes the leaves of the plant. In other cases it helps scientists determine which type of flowering plant it will later develop into. The cotyledons are also an essential source of energy for the development of the seed and plant.\nCommunity interaction.\nThere are two common types of soil that are used in scientific studies, nutrient rich soil and nutrient poor soil. The predation of the seeds is not as important as the nutrient level of the soil. Different plants over time have adapted to grow in these different conditions over time. The acorns of the cork oak tree have better regeneration and development in nutrient rich soil. The smaller cotyledon acorns that grow in nutrient rich soil develop."}

Acorns take between about 6 or 24 months (depending on the species) to mature.\nAcorns are one of the most important wildlife foods in areas where oaks grow. Creatures that make acorns an important part of their diet include birds, such as jays, pigeons, some ducks and several species of woodpeckers. Small mammals that feed on acorns include mice, squirrels and several other rodents. Such large mammals as pigs, bears, and deer also eat large amounts of acorns: they may constitute up to 25% of the diet of deer in the autumn. In some of the large oak forests in southwest Europe, traditionally called \"dehesas\", pigs are still turned loose in oak groves in the autumn, to fill and fatten themselves on acorns. \nAcorns contain tannins, which are toxic to some animals such as horses. The tannins can be soaked out, using water."}

That can be less solid material like sand, gravel, clay or silt, but it can be rock as well, as long as the rock allows water to get in (that means that it is water-bearing).\nFrom such layers or groundwater can be usefully extracted using a well. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.\nGroundwater in rock formations.\nGroundwater may exist in underground rivers (e.g., caves where water flows freely underground). This may occur in eroded limestone areas known as karst topography, which make up only a small percentage of Earth's area. More usual is that the pore spaces of rocks in the subsurface are simply saturated with water \u2014 like a kitchen sponge \u2014 which can be pumped out for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses.\nIf a rock unit of low porosity is highly fractured, it can make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), if the water can get through it. Porosity is important, but, \"alone\", it does not make an aquifer. The Deccan Traps (a flood basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock with high porosity but low permeability, so they are poor aquifers. The (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England has a reasonably high porosity, but low grain-to-grain permeability. Much of its good water-yielding characteristics being due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.\nExploitation.\nAquifers can occur at various depths. Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be exploited for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them which can be exploited as groundwater resources. If more water is taken out than get in again one speaks of over-harvesting. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, population growth has led to over-population which has caused the lowering of water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea (saline intrusions). In these cases the aquifer contains brackish water.\nWhen water seeps (comes slowly) out of the ground, it is called a seep or \"spring (water)\". It usually means there is an aquifer under the ground."}

He is known for his swashbuckler roles in movies like \"Adventures of Don Juan\" and \"The Sea Hawk\".\nEarly years.\nErrol Flynn was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. His father Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania. Flynn was born at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point. His mother was born Lily Mary Young. She dropped the first names Lily Mary shortly after she was married and changed her name to Marelle. Flynn described his mother's family as \"seafaring folk\". This may account for his lifelong love of the sea and boats.\nFirst movies.\nHe became a naturalized American citizen in 1942. He is remembered for his successful on-screen partnership with Olivia de Havilland. They appeared together in eight movies: \"Captain Blood\" (1935, his first great success), \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1936), \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), \"Four's a Crowd\" (1938), \"Dodge City\" (1939), \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (1939), \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), and \"They Died with Their Boots On\" (1941). This partnership started rumors of romance. De Havilland denied these rumors. She said her relationship with Flynn was one of friendship only.\nWWII years.\nFlynn tried to enlist in every branch of the United States Armed Services during WWII. He was classified 4F because of numerous health issues. Hollywood executives kept his health issues a secret to protect his screen image. He never served and was criticized for this. As the years passed, Flynn's manly image diminished. He became an alcoholic, gained weight, and had a seedy appearance. Flynn wrote his autobiography \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\" in 1959. He died of a heart attack at age 50. His last words were reportedly, \"I've had a hell of a lot of fun and I've enjoyed every minute of it\".\nMarriages and children.\nFlynn was married three times: first to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn, 1941\u201370?); to Nora Eddington from 1943 until 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre born 1945 and Rory born 1947); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma, 1953\u20131998).\nLifestyle.\nFlynn had a reputation for womanizing and freewheeling fun. His hedonistic lifestyle caught up with him in 1942 when two under-age girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, accused him of statutory rape. The two girls said that the event occurred at the Bel Air home of Flynn's friend Frederick McEvoy. A group was organized to support Flynn. It was called the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF). Its members included William F. Buckley, Jr. The trial took place in January and February 1943. Flynn was cleared of the charges."}

It is a group of organisms which a taxonomist decides belong together.\nTaxa can be big or small, a fairly small taxon is the giraffes, a very big one is the beetles.\nA taxonomist can assign a scientific name and rank to a taxon; this places it at a particular level in a hierarchy. It is not strictly necessary to assign either a name or a rank to a taxon, but doing so makes it much easier to refer to the taxon. However, many taxa have to wait for years before getting a name.\nRanks.\nThere is no limit to the number of ranks that may exist, but the most important ranks are, in hierarchical order:\nNote: \"Phylum\" applies formally to any biologial domain but traditionally it was always used of animals whereas \"Division\" was traditionally often used of plants, fungi etc.\nA simple phrase to remember the order is\n\"Dignified Kings Play Chess On Fine Green Silk\" (there are many other such phrases).\nTaxonomy.\nA distinction is made between taxonomy and systematics. Systematics deals with how groups relate to each other. Taxonomy deals with making groups (taxa), deciding what belongs together. Taxonomy is also known as classification.\nA special part of taxonomy is nomenclature. This consists of rules on what names to use. So a taxonomist first decides what does and does not belong in a group, and then uses nomenclature to decide what name this group should have. If a group is made larger or bigger it may get a different name. On the other hand, the same name may refer to a bigger taxon (according to one particular taxonomist) or a smaller taxon (according to some other taxonomist). This means that scientific names are not guaranteed to be stable. Most names are stable, but for some taxa there is no agreement on its name, because taxonomists do not agree what does belong together and what does not belong together.\nA taxonomist can decide for himself what scientific reasons he adopts for making a group (a taxon). If he is not convincing in his choice, other taxonomists will not agree with him, and they will then make other arrangements. These days biological classification is mostly supposed be done according to evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships, so far as these are known."}

Enjoying beautiful flowers is an old Japanese custom. Cherry blossoms are the most popular. The custom of hanami is more than a thousand years old. It is still very popular in Japan. Hanami takes place in the spring. Cherry blossoms are there for only a week or two. The cherry trees flower in late March and early April. The blossoms do not stay fresh very long. After a little time, the blooming is over. Then the blossoms fall from the trees.\nAn older form of hanami also exists in Japan. It celebrates the plum blossoms, instead of the cherry blossoms.\nHistory.\nThe practice of hanami is many centuries old. It started during the Nara Period (710\u2013784) when the Chinese Tang Dynasty influenced Japan in many ways; one of which was the custom of enjoying flowers. Though it was ume blossoms that people admired in the beginning, by the Heian Period (794\u20131185), sakura began to attract more attention. The sakura were considered sacred by the Japanese, and they were so important that they still are a cultural symbol of Japan. People believed in gods' existence inside the trees, and the hanami party was used in the beginning to divine that year's harvest and to announce the season of planting rice. Those who went to the hanami made offerings at the root of sakura trees, and after the ceremony, they took part in the offering drinking sake.\nEmperor Saga of the Heian Period adopted this custom, and celebrated parties to view the flowers with sake and feasts under the blossoming branches of sakura trees in the Imperial Court in Kyoto. This was said to be the origin of hanami in Japan. Poems were written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself; beautiful, but lasting for a very short time. This 'temporary' view of life is very popular in Japanese culture and is usually considered as an admirable form of existence; for example, in the samurai's principle of life ending when it's still beautiful and strong, instead of slowly getting old and weak. The Heian era poets used to write poems about how much easier things would be in Spring without the sakura blossoms, because their existence reminded us that life is very short:\nHanami was used as a term that meant \"cherry blossom viewing\" for the first time in the Heian era novel \"Tale of Genji\" (chapter 8, \u82b1\u5bb4 \"Hana no En, \"Under the Cherry Blossoms\"\"). From then on, in \"tanka\" and in \"haiku\" poetry, \"flowers\" meant \"sakura\", and the terms \"hanami\" and \"flower party\" were only used to mean sakura blossom viewing.\nAt the beginning, the custom was followed only by the Imperial Court, but the samurai nobility also began celebrating it during the Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1568\u20131600). In those years, Toyotomi Hideyoshi gave great hanami parties in Yoshino and Daigo, and the festivity became very popular through all the Japanese society. Shortly after that, farmers began their own custom of climbing nearby mountains in the springtime and having lunch under the blooming cherry trees. This practice, called then as the \"spring mountain trip\", combined itself with that of the nobles' to form the urban culture of hanami. By the Edo Period (1600\u20131867), all the common people took part in the celebrations, in part because Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.\nToday.\nJapanese people continue the tradition of hanami. People fill parks to eat and drink under the flowering trees. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming days come at the same time of the beginning of school and work after vacation, and so welcoming parties are often opened with hanami. Usually, people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate hanami with friends, family, and company co-workers many hours before. In many places such as Ueno Park, temporary paper lanterns are hung for night viewing of the flowers.\nThe blossom forecast or cherry blossom front is announced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The first cherry blossoms happen in the subtropical southern islands of Okinawa, while on the northern island of Hokkaido, they bloom much later. In most large cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April. The television and newspapers closely follow this \"cherry blossom front\", as it slowly moves from south to north.\nOutside Japan.\nHanami is also popular outside of Japan. There are hanami celebrations in Korea, Philippines, China, and elsewhere (many other places).\nIn 1912, Japan gave 3,000 sakura trees to the United States to celebrate the nations' friendship. These trees were planted in Washington, D.C.. 3,800 more trees were added 1956. These sakura trees are a popular tourist attraction. Each year, the \"National Cherry Blossom Festival\" happens when they bloom in early Spring.\nIn Macon, Georgia, another cherry blossom festival called the \"International Cherry Blossom Festival\" is celebrated every spring. Macon is known as the \"Cherry Blossom Capital of the World\" because 300,000 sakura trees grow there.\nIn Brooklyn, New York, the \"Annual Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival\" takes place in May at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. This festival started in 1981 and is very popular."}

Neighbourhoods are often social communities because the people that live in them commonly talk with each other. Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition.\nPreindustrial cities.\nAccording to urban scholar Lewis Mumford, Neighbourhoods have always exist where humans live. Many of the functions of the city are usually distributed into neighbourhoods. Archaeologists have found evidence of neighbourhoods in the ruins of most of the earliest cities around the world. Historical documents give information about neighbourhood life in many historical preindustrial or nonwestern cities.\nNeighbourhoods are usually created by social interaction between people living near each another. They are local social groups larger than households that are not under the control of city or state officials. In some early urban traditions, basic municipal functions such as protection, marriages, cleaning and repairs are done by neighbourhoods. This is shown to have happened in historical Islamic cities.\nMost ancient and historical cities also had administrative districts. These were used by the government for taxation and social control. Administrative districts are usually larger than neighbourhoods. They often cover areas that are larger than just one neighbourhood. Sometimes, administrative districts are just one neighbourhood. This leads to a lot of control of social life by officials. For example, in the T\u2019ang period Chinese capital city Chang\u2019an, neighbourhoods were districts. There were state officials who controlled life and activity at the neighbourhood level.\nNeighbourhoods in very old cities often grouped certain people together. Ethnic neighbourhoods were important in many old cities. They are still common in cities today. Economic specialists, including craft makers, merchants, and others, could be grouped together in neighbourhoods. There were also neighbourhoods based around certain religions. One important part to neighbourhood being different from each other and their people getting along well was how people moved from rural areas to the cities. This was always happening in old cities. The people moving to the cities often moved in with relatives and people they knew from before moving to the city.\nRegions.\nAsia.\nChina.\nIn the mainland of the People's Republic of China, the term is usually used for the urban administrative division. These divisions are found below the district level. A subdistrict level may exists in some cities. They are also called streets. The naming may be different from one city to another. Neighbourhoods usually have 2,000 to 10,000 families. Within neighbourhoods, families are grouped into smaller groups of 100 to 600 families. These smaller groups are supervised by a residents' committee. These groups are often broken down into even smaller groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighbourhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning.\nTurkey.\nNeighbourhood () in Turkey is an administrative unit within municipalities. It has an official status but no governmental powers. Neighbourhoods are administered by the Mukhtar and the \"Neighbourhood Seniors Council\". This is a group of 4 people. The mukhtar is elected by the people living in the neighbourhood. He is an administrator of the district governor. Mukhtar also has a seat at the City Assembly. This is an organization for the coordination of the public institutions in the city. Neighbourhood administrators get a salary from the Central Government. They also get money from the fees paid for dealing with certain documents.\nEurope.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe term has no official use in the United Kingdom. It is often used by local boroughs for sub-divisions of their area for the delivery of certain services and functions. It is also used as a term to refer to a small area within a town or city. The term is commonly used to refer to organisations which deal with such a very local issues, such as neighbourhood policing or Neighbourhood watches. Government statistics for local areas are often called neighbourhood statistics even though the data is usually broken down into districts and wards.\nNorth America.\nIn Canada and the United States, neighborhoods often have official or semi-official status. This is commonly done using neighbourhood associations, neighbourhood watches, or block watches. These may deal with such things as lawn care and fence height. They may provide such things as block parties, neighbourhood parks, and community security. In some other places the organisation is the parish. A parish may have several neighbourhoods in it depending on the area."}

Its original date of founding is unknown. James VII (also King of England as James II) created the modern Order in 1687. The Order is the Sovereign and sixteen Knights and Ladies, as well as certain \"extra\" knights (members of the British and foreign royal families). The Sovereign decides who is to be a member. He or she is not advised by the Government, as occurs with most other Orders. The sixteen members are required to be Scottish-born, but the \"extra\" knights and ladies are not.\nThe Order's main emblems are the thistle, the national flower of Scotland, and Saint Andrew holding a saltire (X shaped cross). The motto is \"Nemo me impune lacessit\" (Latin for \"No one provokes me with impunity\"); the same motto is also on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and on some pound coins. St Andrew is also the patron saint of the Order.\nMost British orders of chivalry cover all of the United Kingdom, but the three most most senior ones each cover only one constituent country . The Order of the Thistle, which covers to Scotland, is the second-most senior in precedence. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. In 1783 an Irish order, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, was founded; but since the independence of the Republic of Ireland the Order has fallen dormant. The last new knight was made in 1927, and the last surviving Knight of St Patrick died in 1974. \nHistory.\nThe first date of the Order's creation is not known. One story says that Achaius, King of Scots, was fighting King Aethelstan of East Anglia and he saw cross of St Andrew in the sky. After he won the battle, Achaius established the Order of the Thistle. Even though Achaius and Aethelstan never fought, this story of the foundation, is given in the Royal Warrant 'reviving' the Order in 1687. Another story says that the Order was instituted, or re-instituted by Robert I at the Battle of Bannockburn.\nKing James II and VII issued letters patent \"reviving and restoring the Order of the Thistle to its full glory, lustre and magnificency\" in 1687. Only 12 knights were allowed, and he appointed eight before the King was deposed in 1688. His successors, the William and Mary, did not make any more appointments to the Order. In 1703 however, Anne once again revived the Order of the Thistle.\nComposition.\nThe Kings of Scotland\u2013later the Kings of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom\u2013have served as Sovereigns of the Order.\nWhen James VII revived the Order, the statutes said that the Order would continue the ancient number of Knights, which was described in the preceding warrant as \"the Sovereign and twelve Knights-Brethren in allusion to the Blessed Saviour and his Twelve Apostles.\nIn 1827, George IV increased the Order to sixteen members. Women were excluded from the Order. George VI created his wife Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon a Lady of the Thistle in 1937, and in 1987 Elizabeth II allowed the regular admission of women to both the Order of the Thistle and the Order of the Garter.\nFrom time to time, individuals joined the Order by special permission. These members are known as \"Extra Knights\" and do not count towards the sixteen-member limit. Members of the British Royal Family are normally admitted by special permission; the first was Prince Albert. King Olav V of Norway, was the first foreigner to be admitted to the Order, was also admitted by special permission in 1962.\nThe Sovereign has historically had the power to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore in 1946, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill), both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.\nKnights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be admitted to the Order of the Garter. \nKnights and Ladies of the Thistle may also have their knighthoods taken away. But this has happened only once, to John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who was \"deprived\" of both the knighthood and the earldom after taking part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.\nThe Order has five officers: \nUniform.\nFor the Order's great occasions, such as its annual service each June or July, as well for coronations, the Knights and Ladies wear an elaborate costume:\nAside from these special occasions, however, much simpler badges are used whenever a member of the Order attends an event at which decorations are worn.\nChapel.\nWhen James VII revived the Order in 1687, he wanted the Abbey Church at the Palace of Holyroodhouse to be the Chapel for the Order of the Thistle, perhaps copying the idea from the Order of the Garter (whose chapel is located in Windsor Castle). \nJames VII was deposed by 1688 and the Order did not have a Chapel until 1911, when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh. Each year, the Sovereign stays at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in June or July; during the visit, a service for the Order is held. Any new Knights or Ladies are installed at annual services. \nEach member of the Order, including the Sovereign, is allotted a seat in the Chapel. Their coat of arms is above their seat."}

{"id": "67302", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67302", "title": "Arturo Toscanini", "text": "Arturo Toscanini (25 March 1867 \u2013 16 January 1957) was an Italian conductor. Most musicians think he was the greatest conductor of his time. His fame was legendary: he was probably the first conductor to become a world superstar. He had an incredibly good memory and could remember every single note of the large number of works he conducted. He had a photographic memory so that he could remember what the pages looked like. Sometimes he found little mistakes in the scores which no one else had ever noticed. He had a very keen sense of hearing and knew exactly what each instrument was doing. He also had a fiery temperament and there are movies of him shouting angrily at his orchestra in rehearsals. In the early days of gramophone recordings he made some of the first recordings of famous orchestral works.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nToscanini was born in Parma in Italy. He won a scholarship to the local music conservatory, where he learned to play the cello. He joined the orchestra of an opera company and he toured South America with them in 1886. While performing Verdi\u2019s opera \"Aida\" in Rio de Janeiro the audience did not like the conductor and they booed him so that he had to leave the stage. No one knew what to do at first, but then they persuaded Toscanini, who was only 19 years old, to put down his cello and conduct the orchestra. He did this brilliantly from memory (without looking at the music) and that night he became famous.\nWhen he got back to Italy Toscanini returned to his chair in the cello section, and took part as cellist in the first performance of Verdi's \"Otello\" (La Scala, 1887). Verdi was there and was very impressed when Toscanini asked him about a mistake he noticed in the score. \nSoon the young musician's reputation as a brilliant conductor of opera grew. He conducted the first performances of Puccini's \"La Boh\u00e8me\" and Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\". In 1896 he conducted his first symphonic concert (works by Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner), in Turin. By 1898 he was conductor at La Scala, Milan and he stayed there until 1908, but returned during the 1920s. He took the Scala Orchestra to the United States on a concert tour in 1920-21; it was during that tour that Toscanini made his first recordings (for the Victor Talking Machine Company).\nInternational fame.\nToscanini started conducting outside Europe: at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (1908\u20131915) as well as the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1926\u20131936). He toured Europe with the New York Philharmonic in 1930 and always had great success. Toscanini was the first non-German conductor to conduct at Bayreuth (1930\u20131931). In the 1930s he conducted at the Salzburg Festival (1934\u20131937) and the first concert in 1936 of the newly formed Palestine Symphony Orchestra (now the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) in Tel Aviv, and later performed with them in Jerusalem, Haifa, Cairo and Alexandria. \nThe NBC symphony orchestra.\nAt first Toscanini agreed with Fascism but later, when the dictator Mussolini came to power, he became against it. He refused to perform an opera at La Scala and was beaten up, so he left Italy and went to the United States.\nThere was no orchestra for him in the USA so they made a new orchestra for him to conduct. This was the NBC Symphony Orchestra, created for him in 1937. He conducted the first broadcast concert on December 25, 1937, in NBC Studio 8-H in New York City's Rockefeller Center.\nToscanini was often criticized for not performing much American music and contemporary music (music by living composers). However, in 1938, he conducted the world premieres of two orchestral works by Samuel Barber, \"Adagio for Strings\" and \"Essay for Orchestra (Barber)|Essay for Orchestra\". In 1945, he led the orchestra in Carnegie Hall recording sessions of American music including \"An American in Paris\" by George Gershwin. He also conducted broadcast performances of Copland's \"El Salon Mexico\" and Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with soloists Earl Wild and Benny Goodman and \"Concerto in F\" with pianist Oscar Levant, as well as music by other American composers, including two marches of John Philip Sousa.\nIn 1940, Toscanini had a disagreement with the NBC and he threatened to move to CBS. Although they agreed in the end it was this time that Leopold Stokowski began conducting some of the concerts and continued to appear sometimes as a guest conductor of the orchestra.\nIn July 1942 Toscanini conducted the American premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich's \"Symphony no 7\". Due to World War II, the score was microfilmed in the Soviet Union and brought by courier to the United States. At first Stokowski wanted to conduct it but then he agreed that Toscanini would. Unfortunately for New York listeners, a big thunderstorm made it difficult to hear the music on the radio. Later the performance was reissued.\nThe orchestra went all over the world with Toscanini. In 1950 the NBC concerts moved to Carnegie Hall. In a programme of music by Richard Wagner in 1954 Toscanini was not well and forgot how the music went. He never conducted in public again after that.\nPersonal life.\nToscanini married Carla De Martini on June 21, 1897, when she was not yet 20 years old. They had four children although one died. He worked with many great singers and musicians, including the pianist Vladimir Horowitz who was a great friend. Horowitz married one of Toscanini\u2019s daughters.\nWhen he died of a stroke in New York City at the age of 89, his body was returned to Italy and was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan.\nMany years after his death, in 1987, Toscanini was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award."}

In addition to his published novels, Dick wrote \"approximately 121 short stories. He wrote most of them for science fiction magazines.\" At least eight of his stories have been adapted into movies. \nOverview.\nPhilip K. Dick developed what would later be called cyberpunk. Many of his works are about themes from sociology. Often, politics also play an important role. Very often there are Authoritarian Governments, and very powerful companies in his books. In his later books, Dick writes about drug use. He writes about characters that have paranoia or schizophrenia. In novels such as \"A Scanner Darkly\" or \"VALIS\" he uses his own experiences.\nHe was awarded the Hugo Award for his novel, \"The Man in the High Castle\", in 1963. \"I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world we actually have does not meet my standards,\" Dick wrote of these stories. \"In my writing I even question the universe; I wonder out loud if it is real, and I wonder out loud if all of us are real.\" Dick spent most of his career as a writer. He did not have much money.\nDick died of a stroke. In 2007, he became the first science fiction writer to be included in The Library of America series (#173).\nWork.\nThe Man in the High Castle.\n\"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962) takes place in an different universe. There the United States is ruled by the Axis powers, who have won the Second World War. Many people consider it to be one of the important novels about a different view on history. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. Philipkdickfans.com recommends this novel, along with \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and \"Ubik\" as an introductory novel to readers new to the writing of Philip K. Dick.\nThe Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.\n\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (1965) uses many concepts from science fiction. It has several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick\u2019s first works to explore religious themes.\n\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" takes place in the twenty-first century. Under the supervision of the United Nations authority, mankind has colonized the solar system's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using \"Perky Pat\" dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based \"P.P. Layouts\". The company also secretly creates \"Can-D\", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to \"translate\" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth. All \"successful\" humans have left, the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. Androids, also known as andys, all have a preset \"death\" date. However, a few andys seek to escape this fate and supplant the humans on Earth.\n\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968) is well known as the literary source of the influential 1982 movie \"Blade Runner.\" It is about the question \"What is real, what is fake? Are the human-looking and human-acting androids fake or real humans? Should we treat them as machines or as people? What important factor defines humanity as distinctly alive, versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?\nUbik.\n\"Ubik\" (1969) uses big networks of psychics and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. In 2005, \"Time Magazine\" listed it among the All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.\nFlow My Tears, The Policeman Said.\n\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\" (1974) is about Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopic near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints manned by pols and Nats - the police and National Guard - are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID.\nJason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his charisma to help him when he tries to find out what happened to his past and avoid the attention of the pols.\n\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\" was Dick's first published novel after years of silence. In these years, his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated both for a Hugo and for a Nebula Award. \nIn an essay written two years before dying, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopalian priest that an important scene in the novel was very similar to a scene in the Acts of the Apostles. Richard Linklater talks about this novel in his movie Waking Life, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, Time out of Joint.\nA Scanner Darkly.\n\"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels. In its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality. This is because he becomes a victim of the drug he should have fought against. This drug is called \"SubstanceD\". It permanently changes the mind of the people who take it. Substance D is instantly addictive. It starts with a pleasant euphoria. This feeling is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. It was adapted to movie by Richard Linklater.\nVALIS.\n\"VALIS,\" (1980) is perhaps Dick\u2019s most postmodern and autobiographical novel. It looks at his own unexplained experiences. Some people also see it as his most academic work. It was made into an opera by Tod Machover. \"VALIS\" was voted Philip K. Dick\u2018s best novel at the website philipkdickfans.com.\nHis later works, especially the \"VALIS trilogy\", were heavily autobiographical.The word \"VALIS\" is the acronym for \"Vast Active Living Intelligence System\"; it is the title of a novel. The theme can be found in at least three more novels.\nContemporary philosophy.\nDick has had a big impact on modern philosophy. The things he wrote about postmodernity have been noted by many philosophers. Among them were Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. \u017di\u017eek is especially fond of using Dick's short stories to articulate the ideas of Jacques Lacan. For Baudrillard, Dick is the ultimate articulation of hyperreality:\n\"It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move \"through the mirror\" to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.\""}

Each is at a different stage of development, yet the market is growing for many renewables.\nRenewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Both, modern renewables, such as hydro, wind, solar and biofuels, as well as traditional biomass, contributed in about equal parts to the global energy supply. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.\nRenewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits. In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.\nWhile many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas, where energy is often crucial in human development. Globally, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale digesters. Biomass cookstoves are used by 160 million households.\nRationale for renewables.\nClimate change, pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems and addressing them requires major changes to energy supply and use. Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and help to reduce greenhouse gases. Climate-disrupting fossil fuels are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:\nIn global public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies.\nEU member countries have ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, Eurobarometer polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target \"to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020\". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further.\nAs of 2011, new evidence has shown that there are large risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed. Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. Events at the Fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate many nuclear plants safely over the long term. Cost estimates for \u201cnext generation\u201d nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees."}

It opened in 1893. It is best known for being where the Promenade Concerts were started by Robert Newman in 1895.\nThe Queen's Hall was built because London needed a new concert hall in the centre of the town. It stood in Langham Place, just next to where BBC Broadcasting House stands today. The Queen's Hall had seating for up to 3,000 people (including the orchestra). The arena (downstairs) had removable seating. The polished floor could be used for dancing. The acoustics of the hall were excellent. There was also a smaller hall, The Queen's Small Hall, which seated 500 people. This was used for chamber music. In later years it was used as a recording studio. The architect who designed the hall was Thomas Edward Knightley.\nThe first time The Queen's Hall was used was on 25 November 1893 when Newman gave a children's party in the afternoon. In the evening about 2000 ladies and gentlemen came to a concert given by the Band of the Coldstream Guards, which included vocal music, piano and organ solos. At 11.00pm the seats in the arena were removed and the dancing began. The official opening of the hall took place on 2 December. On 10 August 1895 the first Promenade concert was given with Henry Wood conducting.\nOn January 14, 1896, the first public movie show was given at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society.\nThe seats were uncomfortable because there was not enough leg room, so in 1913 and 1919 some changes were made, after which the hall could seat 2400 people. \nFrom 1930 to 1941, the BBC Symphony Orchestra regularly gave broadcast concerts in the hall. Arturo Toscanini, who guest conducted the orchestra during the 1930s, made some famous recordings in the Queen's Hall in the late 1930s.\nOn 10 May 1941 (during the World War II) the Royal Choral Society gave a concert in the Queen's Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra. They performed Elgar's oratorio \"Dream of Gerontius\" under the conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent. It was the last concert ever given there because, later that night, the hall was completely destroyed by bombs. \nAfter the destruction of Queen's Hall, the BBC Symphony Orchestra moved its broadcast concerts and recording sessions to Bedford School. Among the great recordings made at the school was Sir Adrian Boult's recording of Elgar's second symphony. The Proms continued in the Royal Albert Hall. They also took place in Bristol and Bedford, but after the war they settled in the Royal Albert Hall where they continue today."}

{"id": "67354", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67354", "title": "Report of 1800", "text": "The Report of 1800 was first written by James Madison. It argued for the sovereignty of the individual states under the United States Constitution. It argued against the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Virginia General Assembly adopted the Report in January 1800. The document mostly makes small changes to arguments from the 1798 Virginia Resolutions. The main reason for making the Report was to respond to criticism of the Resolutions. The Report was the last important writing by Madison meant to explain the Constitution in great detail, until the 1817 Bonus Bill Veto Message.\nThe arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were used many times during the nullification crisis of 1832. In this crisis, South Carolina said that federal tariffs were unconstitutional and not valid within the state. Madison, however, did not agree. He said that the report did not support nullification. Modern historians debate whether Madison's theory of republicanism really supported the nullification movement. More broadly, historians debate whether the ideas Madison expressed between 1798 and 1800 agree with his work before and after this period. Election of 1800 was significant because it marked the first peaceful change in power from one political party to another.\nBackground.\nMadison, a member of the Republican Party, was elected to the Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. At this time, most members of the General Assembly were Republicans. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, which Madison had written earlier. The Virginia Resolutions, usually discussed together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.\nThe Virginia Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures, including those of New York, Delaware, and the five New England states. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, leading Virginia Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Sen. John Taylor of Caroline (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.\nJefferson, the leader of the Republican Party and then\u2013Vice President, wrote to Madison in August 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for the principles expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 (commonly referred to as \"the principles of '98\"):\nThat the principles already advanced by Virginia &amp; Kentucky are not to be yielded in silence, I presume we all agree. I should propose a declaration of Resolution by their legislatures on this plan. 1st. Answer the reasonings of such of the states as have ventured in the field of reason, &amp; that of the Committee of Congress.\u00a0... 2. Make a firm protestation against the principle &amp; the precedent; and a reservation of the rights resulting to us from these palpable violations of the constitutional compact by the Federal government,\u00a0... 3. Express in affectionate and conciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister-states, and to the instrument &amp; principles by which we are united;\u00a0\u2026 fully confident that the good sense of the American people and their attachment to rally with us round the true principle of our federal compact. But determined, were we to be disappointed in this, to sever ourselves from that union we so much value, rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved, &amp; in which alone we see liberty, safety &amp; happiness.\nIn response to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello during the first week of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: \"From [this position] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [Madison's] judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves.\" Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role \"in softening Jefferson's more extreme views.\"\nJefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at Montpelier on his way to Philadelphia, the national capital, for the winter session of the United States Congress. However, James Monroe, who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year, visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison, since another meeting between two of the most important Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment. The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison. Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified \"protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution\" as one of the four primary elements of the Republican Party plan.\nProduction and passage.\nThe Assembly session began in early December. Once at Richmond, Madison began drafting the Report, though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery. On December 23, Madison moved for the creation of a special seven-member committee with himself as chairman to respond to \"certain answers from several of the states, relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session.\" The committee members were Madison, John Taylor, William Branch Giles, George Keith Taylor, John Wise, John Mercer, and William Daniel. The next day, Christmas Eve, the committee produced a first version of the Report. The measure came before the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, on January 2.\nThough certain to pass due to the Republican majority, which had recently been solidified by the election of a Republican clerk and speaker of the House, the Report was debated for five days. The main point of contention was the meaning of the third of the Virginia Resolutions:\n\u2026this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government, as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties;\u00a0\u2026 and that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by said compact, the states who are parties thereto have the right\u00a0\u2026 to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil\u2026the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them.\nThis resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that it was the people themselves, acting through the states in their sovereign capacity, who were parties to the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.\nVirginia Republicans were happy with the Report. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state, but there was not much public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.\nArgument.\nThe general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles in the Virginia Resolutions. The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures. Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution. Laying into the Acts in his Report, Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits. The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens. Contrary to the Sedition Act, the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack, beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen; indeed, such special intervention against the press was \"expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution.\" As well, Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional.\nTo remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to \"a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it.\" Freedom of the press was necessary, because \"chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.\" The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.\nMore generally, the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.\nIn defense of Virginia Republicans and the Resolutions, Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory, the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests, which states were surely entitled to produce. They were \"expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection.\" By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried to make clear that the Republicans were not moving toward disunion.\nAnalysis.\nThe Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Republican principles. Spencer Roane described it as \"the \"Magna Charta\" on which the republicans settled down, after the great struggle in the year 1799.\" Henry Clay said on the floor of the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800, above other documents, that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation. H. Jefferson Powell, a modern jurist, identifies three persistent themes of Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report: (1) a textual approach to the Constitution, (2) the compact theory, and (3) that caution, not trust, should characterize our approach to those who hold political power.\nIn more recent years, the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment. Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers' ideas on free speech. In the 1957 \"Roth v. United States\" opinion by William Brennan, Madison's Report is cited as evidence that \"the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth.\" Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include \"Thornhill v. Alabama\" (1940) and \"Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC\" (2000).\nIn modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights with regard to federalism and republicanism. According to Kevin Gutzman, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the \"radical southern states' rights tradition.\" However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-nullification Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of \"the people in each of the States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity.\" The state governments themselves, no less than the federal judiciary, possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not.\nGutzman rejects Madison's gloss of the Report as a \"specious distinction,\" saying it is reasonable to read into the Resolutions and the Report an \"ominous challenge to federal supremacy.\" Drew McCoy, however, has argued that Madison indeed developed a moderate stance which stood between the nationalists and the pro-nullification camp. Koch and Ammon agree, stating that \"Nowhere in American political literature does there exist a more careful, precise and mature reiteration of the principles of republican self-government; and nowhere is it clearer that the intermediate existence of state governments between the people and the 'General Government' should function to prevent a totalitarian imbalance in any one center of authority.\""}

It would release atmospheric probes, and possibly release a Triton Lander. NASA has said the earliest possible launch date is 2030.

Voyager 2 studied Neptune's atmosphere, its rings, its magnetosphere, and its moons. Several discoveries were made, including the discovery of the Great Dark Spot and Triton's geysers.\nVoyager 2 found that Neptune's atmosphere was very active, even though it gets only 3% of the sunlight Jupiter receives. Voyager 2 discovered an anticyclone called the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. However, pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Also seen in Neptune's atmosphere at that time was an almond-shaped spot called \"D2\", and a bright, quickly moving cloud high above the cloud decks named Scooter.\nVoyager 2 also found four rings of Neptune and found proof for ring arcs, or incomplete rings around Neptune. Neptune's magnetosphere was also studied by Voyager 2. The planetary radio astronomy instrument found that Neptune's day is sixteen hours, seven minutes. Voyager 2 also discovered auroras, like on Earth, but much more complicated.\nVoyager 2 discovered six moons orbiting Neptune, but only three were photographed in detail: Proteus, Nereid, and Triton. Proteus turned out to be an ellipsoid, as large as an ellipsoid could become without turning into a sphere. Proteus is very dark in color. Nereid, although discovered in 1949, is still not well known even after Voyager 2 passed by. Triton was flown by at about 25,000 miles (40,000 km) away, and became the last object Voyager 2 would ever explore. Triton was shown to have extraordinary active geysers and polar caps. A very thin atmosphere was found, as well as thin clouds."}

One of the main streams is the Kinder River, which drops off the Western edge at Kinder Downfall. Plants on the plateau are mainly heather, with some mosses and bilberry. Bracken grows on the slopes around the plateau. The highest point is Kinder Low at .\nIt can be approached from the southeast up a steep track called Jacobs Ladder.

Several sections of the path have been surfaced with large stone slabs in this area, to try to minimise environmental damage to the delicate moorland ecosystem by the large number of hikers it attracts all year round.\nIn the 1930s, Kinder Scout was the scene of the first mass trespasses by ramblers (Sunday, 24 April 1932) protesting at the lack of public access to the open moorland in many parts of northern England, which were then kept for grouse shooting by the estates of a number of stately homes. Public rights of way were established later, and the 2000 Countryside and Rights of Way Act set a new legal framework in which the bulk of Kinder Scout is now \"Access Land\" where the public has a right to roam freely."}

Its size and unusually bright surface makes Vesta the brightest asteroid, and the only one ever visible to the naked eye from Earth. Vesta's astronomical symbol is .\nDiscovery.\nVesta was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on March 29, 1807. He allowed the prominent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to name the asteroid after the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.\nAfter the discovery of Vesta in 1807, no asteroids were discovered for the next 38 years. During this time the four known asteroids were counted among the planets, and each had its own planetary symbol. Vesta was normally represented by a stylized hearth (). Other symbols are and . All are simplifications of the original .\nPhysical characteristics.\nVesta is the second-most massive body in the asteroid belt. Vesta does have a different interior compared to its surface. It is in the Inner Main Belt, at a distance of about 2.50 AU. It is similar to 2 Pallas in volume (although it is not confirmed), but somewhat more massive.\nVesta's shape is close to the shape of a sphere by its own gravity, but the large concavity and lump at the pole (see 'Surface Features' below) did not fit the criteria from being considered a planet under the IAU. In any case, this resolution was rejected by the IAU membership and Vesta will continue to be called an asteroid. However, it is possible that Vesta may be listed as a dwarf planet in the future, if it is convincingly determined that its shape is from hydrostatic equilibrium.\nIts rotation is actually fast for an asteroid (5.342 h) and prograde, with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min, declination +48\u00b0 with an uncertainty of about 10\u00b0. This gives an axial tilt of 29\u00b0.\nTemperatures on the surface have been thought to be between about -20\u00b0C with the Sun overhead, dropping to about -190\u00b0C at the winter pole. Typical day-time and night-time temperatures are -60\u00b0C and -130\u00b0C, respectively. This estimate is for May 6, 1996, very close to perihelion, while details vary somewhat with the seasons.\nGeology.\nFor Vesta, there is a large collection of possible samples available to scientists, in the form of over 200 HED meteorites, giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure.\nVesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron-nickel core, above with a rocky olivine mantle, and a surface crust. From the first appearance of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (the first solid matter in the Solar System, forming about 4567 million years ago), a likely timeline is as follows:\nVesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this procedure. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been broken by impacts.\nSurface features.\nSome Vestian surface features have been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground based telescopes, e.g. the Keck Telescope.\nThe most notable surface feature is a very large crater that is 460 km in diameter centered near the south pole. Its width is about 80% of the entire diameter of Vesta. The floor of this crater is about 13\u00a0km below, and its rim rises 4\u201312\u00a0km above the surrounding area, with total surface relief of about 25\u00a0km. A central peak rises 18\u00a0km above the crater floor. It is thought that the impact responsible blew up about 1% of the entire volume of Vesta, and it is likely that a group of smaller asteroids known as the \"Vesta family\" are the remains of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that 10\u00a0km fragments of the Vesta family have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is only about 1 billion years old or younger. It would also be the original site of origin of the HED meteorites. In fact, all the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1 Kirkwood gap, or perturbed away by radiation pressure. Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust, and possibly into the mantle which is indicated by spectral signatures of olivine. Interestingly Vesta was not disrupted nor resurfaced by an impact of this magnitude.\nSeveral other large craters about 150\u00a0km wide and 7\u00a0km deep are also present. A dark feature about 200\u00a0km across has been named \"Olbers\" in honour of Vesta's discoverer, but it does not appear in elevation maps as a fresh crater would, and its nature is presently unknown, perhaps an old basaltic surface. It serves as a reference point with the 0\u00b0 longitude prime meridian defined to pass through its center.\nThe eastern and western hemispheres show markedly different terrains. From preliminary spectral analyses of the Hubble Space Telescope images, the eastern hemisphere appears to be have a highly reflective, heavily cratered \"highland\" terrain with old, dusty rocks, and craters probing into deeper plutonic layers of the crust. On the other hand, large regions of the western hemisphere are taken up by dark geologic units thought to be surface basalts.\nFragments.\nVarious small solar system objects are believed to be fragments of Vesta caused by collisions. The Vestoid asteroids and HED meteorites are examples. The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.\nBecause a number of meteorites are believed to be Vestian fragments, Vesta is currently one of only five identified Solar system bodies for which we have physical samples, the others being Mars, the Moon, comet Wild 2, and Earth itself.\nProof of HED meteorite origin.\nThis is based on data from the Dawn probe which orbited Vesta in the asteroid belt for 10 months.\nVesta is the source of the HED meteorites, which are about 6% of all the meteorites which fall to Earth. These meteorites have pyroxene, which is a mineral rich in iron and magnesium. This has been matched exactly to the mineral signatures on Vesta's surface captured by Dawn's instruments.\nVisibility.\nIts size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark (non-light polluted) skies. Recently, in May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989.\nAt that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It was visible in the constellations Ophiuchus and Scorpius.\nLess favourable oppositions during late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere still have Vesta at a magnitude of around +7.0. Even when in conjunction with the Sun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition."}

In Eastern religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Jainism, the concept of \"ahi\u1e43s\u0101\", meaning non-violence, is a central principle. Jainism stresses non-cruelty towards animals, prohibiting adherents from working at a zoo, cutting trees, or using any fabrics, including silk, which are produced through harming other living beings. In Islam, cruelty towards any animal is a punishable sin.\nWithin Europe and North America, there were many precursors of the modern-day animal rights movement.

This can be useful because they can concentrate on the bits which are particularly difficult for them: the string instruments can talk about the bowing etc.\nAn open rehearsal is a rehearsal that the public can come and watch. In opera houses the dress rehearsal is often an open rehearsal. The entry may be free or the audience may have to pay, but not as much as for a ticket for a performance. The audience will have to understand that the performance may be stopped if something goes wrong and needs to be rehearsed. Singers will often save their voices by not singing as loudly as they will in the performance (this is called \"marking\").\nA technical rehearsal in a theatre is a rehearsal for practising things such as lighting and using props."}

They are based in London's Barbican Centre, but they often tour to lots of different countries.\nThe LSO started in 1904. Most of the players had been members of Henry Wood's Queen's Hall orchestra. They left that orchestra when Henry Wood made a rule that they were not allowed to send deputies to rehearsals or concerts. The LSO was set up as a self governing organization. This means that the players themselves organize everything: they decide how much they are going to be paid, who can be in the orchestra, etc.\nThe LSO gave its first concert on 9 June 1904 with Hans Richter conducting. He was principal (main) conductor until 1911, when Edward Elgar took over for a year. Some of the world's most famous conductors have conducted the orchestra. Since January 2007 Valery Gergiev has been the LSO's Principal Conductor. Andr\u00e9 Previn is the Conductor Laureate (Honorary conductor). In 2006, Daniel Harding became the co-principal guest conductor together with Michael Tilson Thomas. Richard Hickox is the Associate Guest Conductor of the LSO. The leader of the orchestra is Gordan Nikolitch.\nThe LSO was the first British orchestra to play overseas when it went to Paris in 1906. The LSO players all came close to death in 1912 because they were due to sail on the RMS \"Titanic\" for a concert in New York. Fortunately they had to change the booking at the last minute. They did tour the USA and Canada that year, and were the first British orchestra to do so.\nIn 1966 the London Symphony Chorus (LSC) was formed to join the LSO for works with choirs.\nFor many years the LSO refused to allow women to become members because they thought the sound would not be so good. \nThe LSO made their first gramophone recording in 1920. Since then they have made many recordings."}

It is based in the Royal Festival Hall, London.\nThe orchestra was formed in 1932 by Sir Thomas Beecham, and played its first concert on October 7 1932 at the Queen's Hall, London. The associate conductor at the time was Malcolm Sargent.\nAt one of the orchestra's early concerts in November 1932 the sixteen-year old Yehudi Menuhin played a programme of violin concertos including the concerto by Elgar which the composer himself conducted.\nIn the 1930s, when Beecham conducted at the Royal Opera House, the orchestra played for operas there. Beecham made many recordings with the orchestra.\nIn 1939 the orchestra's sponsors stopped giving money to the orchestra. The orchestra became a self-governing body, which meant that, like the London Symphony Orchestra, the players organized the orchestra themselves, deciding on their pay, their members, what music they should play etc.\nDuring the Second World War they went round the country playing in places where people would not otherwise hear music.\nMany of the players' instruments were destroyed when the Queen's Hall was bombed in May 1941, but lots of people gave money for them to buy new instruments.\nAfter the war, Beecham returned to the LPO for eighteen months, but left to start a new orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic. The orchestra continued to play with several guest conductors until Eduard van Beinum was appointed. When he became ill they appointed Sir Adrian Boult who stayed until 1956, although he continued to work with the orchestra and became its President in 1965.\nThrough the late 1950s the orchestra did not have much money and had to stop paying the players regular salaries. They only got paid for the work they did. In 1958 the LPO appointed William Steinberg as chief conductor. He helped the orchestra to become better again.\nIn 1964 the LPO became the resident orchestra for Glyndebourne Festival Opera in the summer. They continue to do this today. \nIn 1967 the LPO appointed Bernard Haitink as its principal conductor. He stayed with the orchestra for 12 years and was followed by Sir Georg Solti.\nVladimir Jurowski is now the principal conductor."}

Guillaume Apollinaire wrote the program notes for the ballet \"Parade\", which was created for the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev. This was a collaborative work by Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso and L\u00e9onide Massine. The program notes ran:\nThe movement grew out of Dadaism. This was, amid the horrors of World War I, a protest at the meaninglessness of civilised life.\nAt the same time, the work of Sigmund Freud began to filter through, and affect the literary and art worlds. Andr\u00e9 Breton was trained in psychiatry, and during the war, he worked in a hospital where he used Freud's methods on shell-shock patients. Not surprisingly, Breton influenced many writers and artists after the war.\nFreud's work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind, and its role in steering behaviour and emotion. His way of using free association, and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists. They painted dreamlike fantasies, and practised automatic drawing without sight: 'automatism'.\nIn 1924, Breton wrote a \"Surrealist Manifesto\", which defined surrealism as:\nBreton discussed his first encounter with the surreal, in a description of a hypnagogic state, in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind: \"There is a man cut in two by the window\". This phrase illustrates Breton's view of Surrealism as two distant realities brought together to create a new, uncanny union.\nSurrealist works have an element of surprise: unexpected items are placed next to each other for no clear reason. Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost. The works are an artifact, and Andr\u00e9 Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. From the 1920s in Paris it spread around the globe. It influenced films such as the \"Angel's Egg\" and \"El Topo\".\nTRANSCENDENTAL SURREALISM Is a new artistic approach, that stands as\u00a0 the evolution and redefinition of Surrealism in its classical form, as it became internationally known by Andre Bretton's Manifest in the early 20th century. Transcendental Surrealism in Visual Arts, presented in 2018 by the greek visual artist - architect Giorgios (Gio) Vassiliou (b. 1970). It is based on a completely new theory and philosophy that is summarized in\u00a0 three new foundamental elements, that follow the evolution of ideas, that have emerged so far during the 21st century, in Visual Arts, Psychology, Physics, and the visual perception of the physical world. These three new foundamental elements are: \na) Transcendental perception \nb) Creative imagination\nc) Slow current of thought\nArtists.\nMax Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Marcel Duchamp were some of the best-known surrealist artists.\nSurrealist films.\nMan Ray made the first surrealist film: \"Return to reason\" (1923). Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Dali made two well-known surrealist films: \"Un chien andalou\" (1929) and \"L'\u00c2ge d'or\" (1930). Jean Cocteau made three films, known as the \"Orphic Trilogy\": \"Le Sang d'un po\u00e8te\" (1930), \"Orph\u00e9e\" (1950) and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960), which includes a cameo appearance by Pablo Picasso."}

But it can also mean the scanning of books and making digital versions. A transcriber is a person who performs transcriptions.\nTranscription as going from sound to script must be distinguished from transliteration, which creates a mapping from one script to another that is designed to match the original script as directly as possible. \nStandard transcription schemes for linguistic purposes include the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and its ASCII equivalent, SAMPA. See also phonetic transcription\nIn this table IPA is an example of phonetic transcription of the name of the former Russian president known in English as Boris Yeltsin, followed by accepted hybrid forms in various languages. Note that 'Boris' is a transliteration rather than transcription in strict sense. \nThe same words are likely to be transcribed differently under different systems. For example, the Mandarin Chinese name for the capital of China is \"Beijing\" in the commonly-used contemporary system Hanyu Pinyin, and in the historically significant Wade Giles system, it is written \"Pei-Ching\".\nPractical transcription can be done into a non-alphabetic language too. For example, in a Hong Kong Newspaper, George Bush's name is transliterated into two Chinese characters that sounds like \"Bou-s\u016b\" (\u5e03\u6b8a) by using the characters that mean \"cloth\" and \"special\". Similarly, many words from English and other Western European languages are borrowed in Japanese and are transcribed using Katakana, one of the Japanese syllabaries.\nAfter transcribing.\nAfter transcribing a word from one language to the script of another language:\nThis is especially evident for Greek loan words and proper names. Greek words are normally first transcribed to Latin (according to their old pronunciations), and then loaned into other languages, and finally the loan word has developed according to the rules of the goal language. For example, \"Aristotle\" is the currently used English form of the name of the philosopher\nwhose name in Greek is spelled (\"Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s\"),\nwhich was transcribed to Latin \"Arist\u00f3teles\", from where it was loaned into other languages\nand followed their linguistic development.(In \"classical\" Greek of Aristotle's time, lower-case letters were not used, and the name was spelled .)\nWhen this process continues over several languages, it may fail miserably in conveying the original pronunciation.\nOne ancient example is the Sanskrit word \"dhy\u0101na\" which transcribed into the Chinese word \"Ch'an\" through Buddhist scriptures. \"Ch'an\" (\u79aa Zen Buddhism) was transcribed from Japanese (\u30bc\u30f3 \"zen\") to \"Zen\" in English. \"dhy\u0101na\" to \"Zen\" is quite a change.\nAnother complex problem is the subsequent change in \"preferred\" transcription.\nFor instance, the word describing a philosophy or religion in China was popularized in English as Tao and given the termination -ism to produce an English word Taoism.\nThat transcription reflects the Wade-Giles system.\nMore recent Pinyin transliterations produce Dao and Daoism."}

Williams is known as \"the Father of Country and Western Music\", because his songs were some of the first to come from that . As with many musical , Williams did not set out to create a new kind of music. He simply wanted to make music that his listeners would enjoy, that he would also enjoy making for them.\nSome of Williams's songs are \"Your Cheatin' Heart\", \"Hey Good Lookin'\", \"Jambalaya\", and \"Cold, Cold Heart\". The songs were easy to remember, and many fans sang along when they heard them. Other singers began to include Hank Williams songs in their . Williams made recordings, performed on radio and early television, and also made live appearances.\nEarly life.\nWilliams's parents, Elonzo Huble \"Lon\" Williams and Jessie Lillybelle \"Lillie\" Skipper married on November 12, 1916. Hank Williams was of English-American ancestry. Elonzo Williams worked as an engineer for the railroads of the W.T. Smith lumber company. He was drafted during World War I, serving from July 1918 until June 1919. He was severely injured after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone and sustaining a severe hit to the head. After his return, the family's first child, Irene, was born on August 8, 1922. Another son of theirs died shortly after birth. Their third child, Hiram, was born on September 17, 1923, in Mount Olive. Since Elonzo Williams was a Mason, and his wife was a member of Order of the Eastern Star the child was named after Hiram I of Tyre (one of the three founders of the Masons, according to Masonic legend), but his name was misspelled as \"Hiriam\" on his birth certificate.\nAs a child, he was nicknamed \"Harm\" by his family and \"Herky\" or \"Poots\" by his friends. \nPersonal life.\nWilliams was one of the first to have problems with alcohol and drugs. Well-meaning fans and friends would buy Williams drinks, or invite him to parties, and he would lose control. He began to miss shows, and to give bad performances because of the effects of drugs and alcohol. He lost many of his best engagements, and his suffered.\nDeath.\nWilliams died at age 29 on January 1, 1953, after a of alcohol drinking. He left behind a wife and son, Hank Williams Jr., who also grew up to become a country musician. Williams' songs are still popular, and sung by many musicians. Hank Jr. performed his father's music for many years, but later found success with songs of his own."}

Some music stands are made of wood. These are sometimes very and therefore quite expensive. \nOrchestras usually give their players very heavy metal music stands. This is because the light, fold-up ones are easily knocked over. It is also very difficult to write on music on a fold-up metal stand because there is nothing to press against (in rehearsals musicians often have to write fingering, bowing and other markings in the music).\nThere are also very small music stands that do not have legs and are designed to be put on a table. These can be used for any kind of instrument that can be played sitting at a table.\nThere are also small ones that can be attached to the instrument itself. These are used in marching bands. Thomas Jefferson, former president of the United States, invented a revolving music stand which he never patented because he wanted people to be able to use his invention for free.\nThere are also digital music stands. When the violinist Tasmin Little played the Ligeti\"Violin Concerto\" at a Prom in 2003 she used a special, computerized music stand that had been made for her. There were no gaps in the music where she could have turned the pages of an ordinary music score. Instead, the music was on a computer screen, and she moved to the next page by pressing a pedal with her foot. There was also another pedal for turning back a page which was important to have when practising and for rehearsal."}

There are a certain number of choices. This is a process sometimes known as proportional voting. Each voter has a certain number of points he or she can spread over the choices. That way it is possible to choose more than one option, and to weigh the choices. Usually, this applies when there is more than one position being elected at the same time. For example, it can be used to elect more than one member of a governing board. In cumulative voting, if five positions are to be elected, a voter could cast one vote for each of five different candidates, or the voter could give all five of his votes to one candidate, or two votes to one candidate and three votes to a different candidate. Bullet voting is giving all of the votes to one candidate.\nCumulative voting is used to elect representatives in many companies. Cumulative voting allow shareholders to vote proportionately to the number of shares they hold. This allows a shareholder with 100 shares to cast the equivalent of 100 votes toward any single issue. \nIt is also used to elect some governments.

Previously called \"hokku\", haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nThe traditional hokku usually was written in six verses or more or less 5, 7, 5 syllables and they had to follow (\"on-ji\"). The Japanese word \"cow\", meaning \"sound\", corresponds to a \"mora\", a phonetic unit similar but not identical to the syllable of a language such as English. A haiku has a special \"season word\" (the \"kigo\") to represent the season in which the poem is set, or a reference to the natural world.\nHaiku usually breaks in three parts, called \"kireji\", normally placed at the end of the first five or second seven \"morae\". In Japanese, there are actual kireji words. In English, kireji is often replaced with commas, hyphens, elipses, or breaks in the haiku. Japanese haiku are normally written in one line, while English language haiku are traditionally separated into three lines.\nIn Japanese, nouns do not have different singular and plural forms, so \"haiku\" is used as both a singular and plural noun in English as well.\nExamples.\nJapanese hokku and haiku are traditionally printed in one vertical line.\nFamous writers.\nNon-Japanese poets.\nAll of the poets below have some haiku.

Texas produces the most wind power of any U.S. state, followed by Iowa with 3,670\u00a0MW.\nSeveral forces are working to the advantage of wind power in Texas: the wind resource in many areas of the state is very large, large projects are relatively easy to site, and the market price for electricity is relatively high because it is set by natural gas prices. The wind power industry is also creating many jobs and farmers may earn extra income by leasing their land to wind developers.\nThe Roscoe Wind Farm (781 MW) is the world's largest wind farm. Other large wind farms in Texas include: Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center, Sherbino Wind Farm, Capricorn Ridge Wind Farm, Sweetwater Wind Farm, Buffalo Gap Wind Farm, King Mountain Wind Farm, Desert Sky Wind Farm, Wildorado Wind Ranch, and the Brazos Wind Farm.\nOverview.\nWind power has a long history in Texas. West Texas State University began wind energy research in 1970 and led to the formation of the Alternative Energy Institute (AEI) in 1977. AEI has been a major information resource about wind energy for Texas.\nTexas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development in the USA, ahead of Iowa and California. The expanding wind power market will help Texas meet its 2015 renewable energy goal of 5,000 new megawatts of power from renewable sources.\nThe table below lists the larger wind farms in Texas, currently operating or under construction. Wind farms which are smaller than 120 MW in capacity are not shown.\nSeveral forces are driving the growth of wind power in Texas: the wind resource in many areas of the state is very large, large projects are relatively easy to site, and the market price for electricity is set by natural gas prices and so is relatively high. The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable:\n\"Wind resource areas in the Texas Panhandle, along the Gulf Coast south of Galveston, and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans-Pecos offer Texas some of the greatest wind power potential in the United States. Currently there are over 2,000 wind turbines in West Texas alone. Most of the new wind capacity added in the last two years has been in the Abilene-Sweetwater area. The Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center is the largest wind power facility in the nation with a total capacity of 735 MW. It is spread across approximately 47,000\u00a0acres in Taylor and Nolan County near Abilene.\"\nWind is a highly variable resource, but with proper understanding it can be readily incorporated into an electric utility's generation mix. Many areas contain areas with winds presently suitable for electric power generation. The number of commercially attractive sites will expand as wind turbine technology improves and development costs continue to drop.\nTexas farmers may lease their land to wind developers for either a set rental per turbine or for a small percentage of gross annual revenue from the project. This offers farmers a fresh revenue stream without impacting traditional farming and grazing practices. Although leasing arrangements vary widely, the U. S. Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that a farmer who leases land to a wind project developer can generally obtain royalties of $3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year in lease payments. These figures are rising as larger wind turbines are being produced and installed.\nThe wind power industry is also creating thousands of jobs for communities and for the state. Wind technology and the various aspects of producing electricity from wind power can help to keep employment in Texas after the rigs stop producing oil.\nTerrorism and industrial accidents can be potential threats to the large, centrally located, power plants that provide most of Texas\u2019 electricity. Should one of these plants be damaged, repairs could take more than a year, possibly creating power shortages on a scale that Texans have never experienced before. Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected."}

While in Heaven, Muhammad met Adam and Moses and Allah (God), and then came back down to Earth.\nEvery year, Muslims hold a festival for the Isra and Mi'raj.

He is the son of country music legend Hank Williams. His nickname is \"Bocephus\", given to him by his father. He has a half-sister, named Jett Williams.\nFrom his boyhood, Hank Jr., performed his father's music publicly, because many people were still interested in it, and Hank Sr.'s career was cut short by alcohol and drug abuse. Young Williams wanted to perform music of his own, and to have his own musical career apart from his father's, but it was hard to \"get out from his father's shadow\", and be recognized for his own talents.\nIn time, Williams met musicians who liked him for his own ideas, and helped him to develop his own kind of music. He was able to become an original writer and performer, while still being proud to be Hank Sr.'s son. Some of his father's fans were sad that he wanted to do this, but others understood. He also gained new fans, performing his new music.\nSome of Williams's songs are \"Eleven Roses\", \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"All My Rowdy Friends\", and \"A Country Boy Can Survive\". Even though he had hit records and many fans, it took years for people in country music to accept him and his chosen style. Williams lost out on many awards he could have earned. Finally in the 1980s, he began to win awards as a country performer.\nIn the 1990s, Williams recorded a with his father, by using an old recording, and the two appeared together in a music video through electronic editing.\nIn 2005, Williams donated $125,000 to relief efforts in Mississippi, after Hurricane Katrina. He continues to record and to perform."}

He had married Neeltje Huisman, a fisherman's widow who already had 6 children. Shortly after the marriage, the oldest of Neeltje's daughters had a child of her own, and so at only 23 years old Dorus became known as \"Opa\" in Den Helder where he lived. Although the nickname began as a joke, Dorus soon started acting and looking like a grandpa, and from that time on he became primarily known by his nickname.\nCareer as a lifeboat captain.\nDorus gained most of his fame as a result of his service to the Noord- en zuid-Hollandsche Redding Maatschappij (NZHRM), one of the two main Dutch lifeboat-societies at the time. The NZHRM would later become the Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij (KNRM).\nHowever his life-saving career began in 1872 before he joined the NZHRM, while acting as captain of his own boat. While at sea, he saved all 25 crew members of the barque \"Australia\" from drowning at sea. Because of this incident, Dorus gained a reputation as a rescuer, which preceded his joining the NZHRM as a volunteer. On the basis of his reputation, he was granted the position of coxswain upon joining the NZHRM without having to prove his qualifications. His rank of coxswain entitled him to immediately command his own boat and crew.\nAlthough Dorus joined the NZHRM as a volunteer, he worked so many hours that it precluded him from taking on other paid work. Dorus and all of his crew members received a sum for each trial and each service.\nDuring his nearly 30 years service with the NZHRM, Dorus saved hundreds of people from drowning at sea, becoming legendary long before his retirement. In the waters where he served, he saved such large number of people with such effectiveness that the survival statistics increased dramatically. At the end of his career, although he remained active, his role became more symbolic in nature. \nHonored by King William III.\nIn 1888, Dorus Rijkers met King William III of the Netherlands after rescuing sailors from the German barque \"Renown\". The King gave Dorus a gold medal of honor and smoked a pipe with him.\nRetirement.\nIn 1911, Dorus retired at age 64, after which he received only a very small pension. He struggled to make ends meet by eating simple food and living plainly.\nDuring an October 1922 interview with Dr. L.A. Rademaker, editor of the Hague newspaper 'Het Vaderland', Dorus complained about his situation. He claimed that he had been forced to sell the gold medal of honour in order to buy himself a bicycle. The Helden der Zee Fonds 'Dorus Rijkers' (Dorus Rijkers Fund for the Heroes of the Sea) was created after Dorus' plight and that of other retired life-savers were chronicled in 'Het Vaderland'.\nDeath.\nIn April 1928, Dorus Rijkers died at the age of 81. He was given a funeral that was so grand that it resembled a state funeral in size and style. There was music, a big parade, thousands who came to pay their last respects including a large number of Marine Officers, also high ranking government officials, among them representatives of the Ministry of the Marine. The grandeur of his funeral showed the great public esteem in which Dorus was held at the time. Dorus Rijkers had become a national hero and was by far the most popular Dutchman of those years (according to a poll that surveyed many people in the Netherlands during the 1920s).\nLegacy.\nThere is a very large statue in honor of all the Netherlands sea-rescuers, opened in 1935. This statue is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be in honor of Dorus. In fact, a separate, smaller statue of Dorus was erected in 1939 One of the rescue boats of the KNRM still carries his name with pride. Dorus is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest rescuers of all time."}

They should not be confused with polar lows since people happen to use the same term for polar cyclones. Polar cyclones are usually 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers wide in which the air is moving in a spiral counterclockwise fashion in the northern hemisphere. The reason for the rotation is the same as tropical cyclones, the Coriolis effect. They also exist in places such as Greenland, the Eurasian Arctic area, and northern Canada, with about 15 cyclones per winter. Polar cyclones can form in any time of the year, although summer polar cyclones are usually weaker than the ones that form in the winter. Also, they are not closely studied and are rarely destructive since they happen in areas with little or no population.\nOne center is near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, it is usually near the edge of the Ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude. \nThe Antarctic vortex of the Southern Hemisphere is a single low-pressure zone that is found near the edge of the Ross ice shelf, near 160 west longitude. When the polar vortex is strong, the mid-latitude Westerlies (winds at the surface level between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 latitude from the west) increase in strength and are persistent. When the polar vortex is weak, high-pressure zones of the mid-latitudes may push poleward, moving the polar vortex, jet stream, and polar front equatorward. The jet stream is seen to \"buckle\" and deviate south. This rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm, moist air of the mid-latitudes, resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a \"cold snap\".\nOzone depletion occurs within the polar vortices \u2013 particularly over the Southern Hemisphere \u2013 reaching a maximum depletion in the spring.\nHistory.\nThe polar vortex was first described as early as 1853. The phenomenon's sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) develops during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere and was discovered in 1952 with radiosonde observations at altitudes higher than 20\u00a0km.\nThe phenomenon was mentioned frequently in the news and weather media in the cold North American winter of 2013\u20132014, popularizing the term as an explanation of very cold temperatures.\nA deep freeze that gripped much of the United States and Canada in late January 2019 has been blamed on a polar vortex. The US National Weather Service warned that frostbite is possible within just 10 minutes of being outside in such extreme temperatures, and hundreds of schools, colleges and universities in the affected areas were closed. Around 21 people died in US due to severe frostbite. States within the midwest region of the United States had windchills just above -50\u00b0F (-45\u00b0C), which is colder than the frozen tundra and Antarctica. \nThe Polar vortex has also thought to have had effects in Europe. For example, the 2013\u201314 United Kingdom winter floods were blamed on the Polar vortex bringing severe cold in the United States and Canada. Similarly, the severe, brutal cold in the United Kingdom in the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11 were also blamed on the Polar vortex.\nIdentification.\nPolar cyclones are low-pressure zones embedded within the polar air masses, and exist year-round. The stratospheric polar vortex develops at latitudes above the subtropical jet stream. Horizontally, most polar vortices have a radius of less than . Since polar vortices exist from the stratosphere downward into the mid-troposphere, a variety of heights/pressure levels are used to mark its position. The 50\u00a0mb pressure surface is most often used to identify its stratospheric location. At the level of the tropopause, the extent of closed contours of potential temperature can be used to determine its strength. Others have used levels down to the 500 hPa pressure level (about above sea level during the winter) to identify the polar vortex.\nDuration and power.\nPolar vortices are weakest during summer and strongest during winter. Extratropical cyclones that migrate into higher latitudes when the polar vortex is weak can disrupt the single vortex creating smaller vortices (cold-core lows) within the polar air mass. Those individual vortices can persist for more than a month.\nVolcanic eruptions in the tropics can lead to a stronger polar vortex during winter for as long as two years afterwards. The strength and position of the polar vortex shapes the flow pattern in a broad area about it. An index which is used in the northern hemisphere to gauge its magnitude is the Arctic oscillation."}

They are skilled at different Japanese arts, like playing classical Japanese music, dancing and poetry. Some people think that geisha are prostitutes, but they are not.\nThe term 'geisha' is made of two Japanese words, () meaning 'art' and () meaning 'person who does' or 'to be employed in'. The most literal translation of geisha to English is 'artist'. Geisha are respected as artists and performers: it is difficult to become one.\nKyoto is the city with the most strict geisha traditions. Geisha have worked there for the longest time. Becoming a professional geisha can take up to five years of training in Kyoto.\nApprentice geisha are called . This name is made of the Japanese words () meaning 'dancing' and () meaning 'child'. wear white make-up called and long-sleeved kimono of many bright colours. in some places wear a belt, called an , that is up to long. Many wear fancy hairstyles made with their own hair, though in some places wear wigs. Full geisha wear simpler kimono, and only use white make-up at special times. Geisha also wear wigs, and their kimono belt is much shorter.\nThere are also geisha in other cities, though there are differences. In Tokyo, becoming a full geisha takes from six months to a year. Geisha apprentices in Tokyo are called , which means 'half jewel' or 'half pay'. Apprentice geisha in Tokyo are also called , which means 'one who serves (alcohol)'. Geisha in Tokyo are normally older than geisha in Kyoto.\nMany geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called in neighborhoods called which means 'flower town'. Older geisha who are successful may have their own home. A geisha always needs to be registered to a geisha house in order to work.\nThe world that geisha are a part of is called , which means 'the flower and willow world'. One very famous geisha, , said this is because \"[a] geisha like a flower, beautiful in her own way, and like a willow tree, gracious, flexible, and strong\".\nGeisha are considered to be cultural icons of Japan.\nHistory.\nBefore the geisha appeared there were some women who worked as artists and entertainers. In the Heian Period (794-1185), some women entertained people at the Imperial Court through singing and dancing, and these women were known as .\nLater on, women who worked as prostitutes and courtesans entertained men in the red-light districts of Japan. In 1589, authorized the building of a neighborhood in Kyoto, closed from the outside with walls. It was called , and it was dedicated to pleasure. was established as a red-light district officially in 1640, and became one of three areas in Japan where people could legally practice prostitution; the other two areas were in Tokyo, which had been established in 1617, and in Osaka.\nThese areas were known as , and they were the only places where women were allowed to be prostitutes. Courtesans were collectively called , and they were very expensive. entertained men with singing, dancing, poetry, music and conversation as well. The highest ranking were called , and these women did not engage in prostitution like other . Instead, they would have one or two rich clients act as their patron, and these men would pay a lot of money to be entertained by the they were a patron of.\n could turn men away and got to decide who they did and did not entertain. were raised from a young age to be very skilled in different types of art and entertainment, and many of them became celebrities. Many woodblock prints and paintings of famous , and other , exist.\nGeisha only appeared much later, in the Tokugawa period. Originally, geisha were men, who travelled throughout the red-light districts, entertaining clients with music, dancing and poetry. These men were known as geisha, but were also called , and because they played the , a Japanese drum.\nMale geisha were very low-class entertainers, but were thought to be upper class. Every man who wished to be with an had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette, as well as having enough money to pay for her time. Because of this, only the richest nobility got to be entertained by . Because of this, many tea houses () appeared outside , offering entertainment that was not offered inside . At some of the tea houses, some women practiced cheaper prostitution; these women were called . However other women, who were called ('dancing girls'), acted as dancers and musicians. These women soon became very popular. They started calling themselves 'geisha', like the male artists who worked in .\nBy about the year 1700, female geisha had become much more popular than male geisha. A few years later, almost all geisha were women.\nThe government made laws that prohibited geisha from working as prostitutes, and only gave them permission to act as entertainers. One of these laws said that they had to tie their (sash) in the back, as wore theirs at the front as a sign that they were available for sex. Geisha had to wear simpler hairstyles, less hair accessories, less make-up and simpler kimono. If an accused a geisha of stealing her customers, the geisha would be investigated.\nSoon, the geisha became so much more popular than the , that in 1761, the last of retired. Though continued to work in Kyoto and Osaka, as a whole were seen as outdated, too traditional and too expensive. could not leave the red-light districts because they had a lot of debt to the owner of the brothel they worked in, and were not thought of as celebrities or fashionable any more. Most people could not afford to hire them. In contrast, geisha were cheaper, more fashionable, and could leave the red-light districts whenever they wanted. They sang popular songs and did not need several expensive meetings before they would entertain a client. New geisha neighborhoods () were created in Kyoto and other cities.\nIn the 19th century, geisha were in better position than common women, but they also had problems in Japanese society. Sometimes, poor people sold their daughters to a geisha house, though this was not as common as some people think, with many geisha coming from families where their mother or another female relative had once been a geisha. Geisha could not marry, but they could have a patron to pay for their expenses, and some retired when they gained a rich patron. Other men paid a lot of money to take the new girls' virginity (), and if the owner of a geisha house was dishonest and greedy, a young geisha could have her virginity sold a number of times to different men.\nHowever, the reputation and respect for the geisha grew in the Meiji Restoration, and even more after World War II. Important laws that protected them were created. Young girls could not be sold to the geisha houses anymore, and the virginity of young geisha could not be bought. Since then, women only become geisha by their free will.\nModern geisha.\nNumbers of geisha.\nThough people often talk about how there are not many geisha left in Japan, and that geisha might be about to die out, the geisha profession is very resilient. In history, sometimes the numbers of geisha fell, because of changes in the economy or because of war. However, the number of working geisha usually rose again not long after.\nIn the 1920s there were over 80,000 geisha in Japan. In 1944, all geisha districts were shut because of World War Two, and geisha, like everyone else, had to help out with the war; in Tokyo alone, close to 9,000 geisha were still entertaining guests before they were told they could not work as geisha anymore. After the war, geisha districts opened up again on 25 October 1945. By 1967, there were nearly 5,000 geisha in Tokyo again.\nToday, there are far fewer geisha. The exact number of geisha working today is not known, but it is estimated to be around 1,000 to 2,000.\nGeisha in the 21st century.\nGeisha today live and work throughout Japan, in different geisha districts () that have their own traditions of arts, training and clothing. The most well known geisha live in Kyoto, where there are five geisha districts, and the most famous geisha district in Kyoto is , which is sometimes just called . There are also lots of geisha in Tokyo, and in towns with hot springs in them, like the town of . In some places in Japan, people have decided to bring back the geisha districts that had no geisha in them for decades.\nMany geisha houses and districts now use social media to advertise their work, and geisha do not need to be born into a geisha district to work there. Some geisha districts put on events to attract tourists; in Kyoto, places like Corner put on dances performed by that anyone can go and watch.\nPeople can also pay to dress up like geisha or for the day. Being dressed up as a geisha or is known as . Some dress-up services, like those in Kyoto, allow you to walk around the city for the day in dress-up. However, they will not dress someone completely accurately, so that real geisha and cannot be confused with people in costumes. If someone wearing wants to be dressed the exact same as a geisha or , they cannot walk around outside. Most, if not all, services will take photographs of someone in dress-up for them to keep. Real geisha do not have the time to take pictures with tourists, so most women dressed as geisha or who appear on the photos of tourists are in fact people in .\nYoung women who wish to become geisha now usually begin their training after finishing junior high school, or even high school or college. Many women begin their careers as adults. Geisha still study traditional musical instruments like the , the (bamboo flute), and drums, as well as traditional songs, Japanese traditional dance, tea ceremony, literature and poetry. By watching other geisha, apprentices also become skilled in the difficult traditions of dressing, make-up, and in dealing with clients.\nGeisha are often hired to go to parties and gatherings, at tea houses or at traditional Japanese restaurants (). Their time is measured by the time it takes an incense stick to burn, and is called ('incense stick fee') or ('jewel fee'). In Kyoto the terms and , meaning 'flower fees', are used instead. The clients hire the service of geisha through the geisha district's union or registery office, known as the , which takes care of the geisha's schedule, and will make appointments for her to entertain customers and train in the traditional arts.\nTraining.\nTraditionally, geisha began their training at a very young age. Although some girls were sold to become geisha as children, this was not normal practice in hanamachi with good reputation. Daughters of geisha were often educated as geisha themselves.\nThe first part of training is called \"shikomi\". In the past, when girls first arrived at the okiya, they were put to work as maids, or do everything they were told. The work was difficult, to \"make\" and \"break\" the new girls. The most junior shikomi of the house had to wait late into the night for the senior geisha to return from work, sometimes as late as two or three in the morning. During this stage of training, the shikomi went to classes at the hanamachi's geisha school. In modern times, this stage still exists, but it is not as hard as it was in the past. Now, shikomi become used to the traditions and dress of the \"kary\u016bkai\" (\"flower and willow world\").\nWhen the apprentice became skilled in the geisha arts, and passed a final and difficult dance test, she was promoted to the second stage of training: \"minarai\". Minarai did not do the housework anymore. This stage also exists today, but is much shorter than in the past (only a month). The minarai learn in the field. They go to banquets and dance with the geisha, but they do not participate: they just sit, watch and learn from their \"onee-san\" (\"older sisters\"). Their kimono are more elaborate than even a maiko's, to do the talking for them.\nAfter a short time, the third (and most famous) stage of training begins, called \"maiko\". Maiko are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for years. Maiko learn from their senior geisha and follow them around to every presentation she does. The \"onee-san/imoto-san\" (\"older sister/younger sister\") relationship is very important. The onee-san teaches her maiko everything about working in the hanamachi. She will teach her the right ways of serving tea, playing the shamisen, and dancing, and everything about the art of \"Iki\" (see below). Maiko have to wear heavy white make-up, elaborate hairstyle, and have her lips painted almost all the time. Their kimono and obi have more vibrant colors and richer embroidery than those of full geisha. Like the minarai, maiko do not charge as much money to go to parties or gatherings as a full geisha.\nAfter a period of only six months (in Tokyo) or five years (in Kyoto), the maiko is promoted to a full geisha and charges full price for her time. Geisha use kimono of fewer colors and only use make-up for work or dance, because she is more mature than a maiko, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. Geisha remain as such until they retire.\nThe art of geisha and \"Iki\".\nGeisha must be very skilled at traditional Japanese music, dance, and poetry, because they use all these arts when they work. The art of make-up, hairstyles, and clothing are very important too.\nThe most important principle of a geisha is called iki. Iki started in the 18th century as a reply to the extravagant ways of the courtesans (\"oiran\") and those who liked their style. Oiran wore very elaborate clothes, make-up, and jewelry. Geisha preferred to be discreet, and more intelligent. They created iki as a style that gave more importance to conversation and wit. Instead of working with sex, like oiran did and simple prostitutes do today, geisha try to be sexy. A geisha will flirt, tease, and joke with men, but always with art and elegance. Japanese clients know that nothing more can be expected. Men enjoy the illusion of that which is never to be. Geisha do not have sex with clients for money.\nGeisha give more importance to their reputation than prostitutes do, and they almost never enter a relationship with a client. Those that do generally act with care usually get married. Normally, when a geisha marries, she retires from the profession. The most important quality of a geisha is her trustworthiness, especially to Japanese clients. Anything that her clients do, or tell her, must remain a secret. Anything said or done at a tea house will remain anonymous.\nBecoming a geisha needs much discipline. A geisha believes she must be a work of art in herself. They work every day to improve, in everything they do. A geisha's movements, her way of walking, sitting and talking are very important. Geisha are geisha all the time, even when they are at home or not working. An example of this dedication is the old custom of \"kangeiko\" (\"lessons in the cold\"). Until the early 1920s, apprentice geisha used to put their hands in icy water, and then go outside in cold weather to practice playing the shamisen until their fingers bled."}

Midgley was accidentally killed by something he was inventing.\nEarly life.\nMidgley was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. His father was also an inventor. He grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from Cornell University in 1911 with a degree in mechanical engineering. His name was Thomas Midgley Jr because his father's name was also Thomas Midgley.\nDiscovery of Leaded Gasoline/Petrol.\nMidgley began working at General Motors in 1916. In December 1921 Midgley discovered that the addition of Tetraethyllead to gasoline prevented \"knocking\" in internal combustion engines.\nDiscovery of Freon.\nIn the 1930s Midgley developed a non-poisonous substance called CFC (chlorinated fluorocarbon) for use in refrigerators, inhalers and aerosol spray cans.

Polar lows can be difficult to detect using standard weather reports and are a problem to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms.\nPolar lows have been also known as by using many other terms, such as \"comma cloud\", \"mesocyclone\", \"polar mesoscale vortex\", \"Arctic hurricane\", \"Arctic low\", and \"cold air depression\".

He also was an orator, and general of Athens. He lived between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the Alcmaeonid family.\nPericles had great influence on Athenian society. Thucydides, a contemporary historian, described him as \"the first citizen of Athens\". Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the \"Age of Pericles,\". This period though can include times as early as the Persian Wars, or as late as the next century.\nIn Pericles late 20\u2019s he sponsored a major dramatic production for the festival of Dionysus, and he also entertained the whole city. Pericles also got married and had 2 sons. His wife's name is unknown. He associated with a courtesan named Aspasia. A decade later the people started to like him more and more. He got involved with the politics called Ephialtes. Pericles and Ephialtes took away the noble's powers. Ephialtes was later assassinated.\nPericles promoted the arts and literature. This was a chief reason Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural centre of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that built most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis (including the Parthenon). This project made the city more beautiful., It also showed its glory, and gave work to the people. Furthermore, Pericles fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics call him a populist."}

They were used as government centers, storerooms, stores, and administrative offices. Most palaces were very big. The Cretans might have gotten the money to create these palaces from working for the Egyptians. The royal palace was very different. Everyone had toilets, baths, and running water.

It was first performed on October 14, 1903.\nHistory of its composition.\nElgar had been thinking for many years about writing a musical work about Jesus's Twelve Apostles. He was already 42 when his orchestral work \"Enigma Variations\" was first performed in 1899. He was then asked by the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival to compose a big work for the following year. At first he thought of writing \"The Apostles\", but then he realized he would need more than a year to write it, so he composed an oratorio called \"The Dream of Gerontius\". When it was first performed it was not a success. This was because the orchestra and choir had only had two weeks to learn it and also because the conductor did not like Elgar's music anyway. Then it was performed in D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany and shortly afterwards in Westminster Cathedral, London. Both these performances were greeted with lots of applause. Elgar was given a doctorate (title of Dr) by the University of Cambridge and he was becoming famous. He started to work on \"The Apostles\", and it was performed in Birmingham in 1903.\nOriginally Elgar wanted to write three oratorios which would belong together. \"The Apostles\" is the first one, the second one became \"The Kingdom\" but the third one, which would have been about the Last Judgement, was never written.\nThe words and music.\nThe oratorio is about the disciples of Jesus and the way they react to the amazing things that Jesus does. There are six soloists: the narrator (who tells the story)- he has a tenor voice and also does the part of St John, St Peter (bass), Jesus (bass) and Judas (bass) and the two female singers: the soprano who is both the Blessed Virgin and the angel Gabriel, and the mezzo-soprano who is Mary Magdalene.\nSometimes \"The Apostles\" is criticized for not being a carefully thought out dramatic story. Elgar was more interested in what makes people behave in the way they do. He was particularly interested in the two sinners Mary Magdalene and Judas Iscariot.\nThe orchestra is very big. The music includes the call of the shofar. Often this is played on a brass instrument. There is a double choir and a small choir (semichorus).\nThe parts of the oratorio.\nThe work is in two parts and seven sections, each played without a break. Elgar chose the words himself. He spent a lot of time looking at different translations of the Bible and combining sentences from several of the versions.\nEvaluation.\nUnlike \"The Dream of Gerontius\" which people did not like the first time they heard it, \"The Apostles\" was an immediate success with audience and critics. People were getting used to the kind of big oratorio that Elgar was writing. However, today \"The Dream of Gerontius\" is the most popular of Elgar's oratorios. \"The Apostles\" is a strange mixture of words from different parts of the bible, but it has some very beautiful music. Elgar often wrote the music first and then added the words afterwards.\nElgar uses leitmotifs in this work: melodies that are associated with particular people or ideas. He got this idea from Wagner. Some of the leitmotifs heard in \"The Apostles\" can also be heard in \"The Kingdom\"."}

It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI. It is used around the world in meteorology and for maritime and aviation purposes.\nDefinition.\n1 international knot = 1\u00a0nautical mile per hour = 1.852\u00a0kilometres per hour exactly. This is based on the internationally agreed length of the nautical mile, as adopted by the US in 1954 (which previously used the US nautical mile of 1853.248 m), the UK in 1970 (which previously used the UK or Admiralty nautical mile of 1853.184 m) and other countries. This is the definition used in most, if not all, modern circumstances. Knot is sometimes used for the nautical mile itself, but this is incorrect.\nThe speed of a vessel relative to the fluid in which it travels is usually measured in knots. This may be referred to as 'boat speed', 'vessel speed' and, for aircraft, 'air speed'. The speeds of relevant fluids, such as tidal streams, river currents and wind speeds, are also usually specified in knots. Knots are then also used to describe the actual speed of a vessel over the ground (SOG) and for its rate of progress toward a distant point ('velocity made good' or VMG).\nConversions.\nOne (international) knot is the same as 1.852 kilometres per hour (km\u00b7h\u22121), and is approximately equal to the following:\nDiscussion.\nAlthough knots do not fit within the primary SI system, they are used for nautical and aviation use for navigational reasons, because the length of a nautical mile is almost identical to a minute of latitude. As a result, distance in nautical miles on a navigational chart can easily be measured by using dividers and the latitude indicators on the side of the chart."}

It travels around to give concerts in many places.\nHistory.\nThe RPO was started just after World War II, in 1946, by the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. Beecham did not start to get his players together until three weeks before the first concert which took place in Croydon on September 15, 1946. Beecham was principal conductor until his death in 1961.\nWhen the orchestra toured the United States in 1950 they were the first British orchestra to visit America since the London Symphony Orchestra in 1912.\nBeecham controlled all the organization of the orchestra. After Beecham\u2019s death, the orchestra was made into a self-governing group, like the other London orchestras. They went through some difficult years. In 1963 the Royal Philharmonic Society decided they would stop asking the RPO to play for their concerts, and in Glyndebourne, where the RPO had played for the opera since 1948, the London Philharmonic Orchestra became the resident orchestra instead. Sir Malcolm Sargent helped the orchestra to put on its own concerts at a cinema in north London.\nThe orchestra had made an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society about the concerts it would play. This meant it could call itself \u201cRoyal\u201d. In the 1960s the work they were doing no longer allowed them to call themselves \u201cRoyal\u201d, so in 1966 the Queen officially gave them the title \u201cRoyal\u201d.\nIn 1992 the orchestra appointed Peter Maxwell Davies as associate conductor and composer of the RPO.\nOn April 7, 1994, the Royal Philharmonic had the honour of performing at the Vatican in the historic \"Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust\" with Sir Gilbert Levine.\nThe RPO give a series of concerts in the Cadogan Hall, London, and in the Royal Albert Hall. They tour all over Britain and also abroad. In the period 2002-2007 they played in 30 different countries.\nRecordings.\nThe orchestra made many recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1964 Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera \"The Rake's Progress\" with the RPO. From 1964 to 1979 they recorded many Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D\u2019Oyly Carte Opera Company.\nNon-classical work.\nThe Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra is part of the same organization. They spend their time playing lighter classical music. The RPO have also worked with pop music groups and has given its own series of children\u2019s concerts.

He went to school in Westminster School and studied at Christ Church, Oxford. He then went to the Leipzig Conservatory where he learnt to conduct by watching the great Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch. He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913, where he went to watch Nikisch conduct.\nDuring World War I he worked for the War Office, and while he was there in 1918 he planned a series of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra, which included several important new British works including Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", \"A London Symphony\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Elgar's \"Symphony No. 2\". When Boult was a boy he had already met Elgar. Elgar now wrote to him and said he felt sure the future of his music was safe in Boult's hands. Boult was at the start of a great career in which he conducted a lot of 20th century British music.\nBirmingham and the BBC.\nIn 1924 Boult became conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra\u2014now the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra \u2014 and in 1930 he was made Director of Music at the BBC. When the BBC formed the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Boult also became its chief conductor, combining both jobs.\nBoult became famous for conducting a wide repertoire, including the very modern-sounding music of Arnold Schoenberg. In 1933 he married Ann Wilson, the ex-wife of the singer and administrator Steuart Wilson. The marriage lasted until Boult's death. Boult was knighted in 1937.\nWar years and after.\nDuring World War II the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated to Bristol. Even there it was not safe from the bombing and they moved again to Bedford.\nAfter the war the BBC started the BBC Third Programme and Boult was involved in many new plans for concerts and recordings.\nIn 1948, Steuart Wilson became Director of Music at the BBC. Some people were saying that the music on the BBC was not so good and that Boult ought to retire when he became 60 in 1949. He then became conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he made many recordings.\nLater years.\nBoult continued to conduct until he was very old. His many recordings, including music he had heard Nikisch conduct many years before. His last public performance was conducting Elgar's ballet \"The Sanguine Fan\" for London Festival Ballet at the Coliseum, in London on 24 June 1978. \nBoult was made a Companion of Honour in 1969.\nWritings.\nBoult wrote two books about conducting, \"Thoughts on Conducting\" and \"A handbook on the technique of conducting.\" He also wrote an autobiography: \"My Own Trumpet\" (the expression \u201cto blow one\u2019s own trumpet\u201d means: \u201cto boast about oneself).

{"id": "67821", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67821", "title": "Rings of Neptune", "text": "The planet Neptune has a dim planetary ring system which is made up of several separate rings and some \"ring arcs\". The \"rings arcs\" are part of the outer ring called the Adams ring and are not to be seen anywhere else. The ring \"particles\" (small parts) are unusually dark colored, and have large amounts of microscopic dust. Neptune has thirteen known moons. Four of them orbit the planet inside the outermost rings.\nDiscovery and observations.\nThe rings around Neptune could not be seen from Earth with strong telescopes. The evidence that they were there was first seen when scientists were watching the planet as it passed between the Earth and a star. (When this happens, the light of the star is blocked. This is called \"stellar occulation\".) Scientists watched this happen 50 times, and on five of those times in the early 1980s they saw the star give a little \"blink\" just before or after the planet covered it. This meant that rings around the planet were blocking the light, but the rings were not complete.\nIn 1989 the unmanned spacecraft \"Voyager 2\" flew by Neptune. \"Voyager 2\" sent back pictures that gave most of the information that scientists now have about the rings of Neptune. The pictures also help scientists to know why the rings looked incomplete. Not only did the pictures give a closer view, but they also showed the rings in a way that cannot ever be seen from earth. From earth the rings are always seen with the light of the sun shining \"towards\" them. When the spacecraft went past the planet, it took pictures with the sun shining \"behind\" the rings, as well. Big \"particles\" in the rings looked dark against the sunlight, but all tiny dust \"particles\" (microscopic dust) shone brightly when the sun was behind it. This allowed the scientists to work out what the rings were made of, and how all the particles were arranged.\nAs better types of telescopes have been developed, scientists can now see some of the rings from earth. The brightness of Neptune makes it hard to see the rings, which are much dimmer and the faintest rings still cannot be seen, even with vey powerful telescopes.\nAdams ring and the Ring Arcs.\nThe most famous of Neptune's rings is the thin outer Adams ring, although by comparison with the rings of the planets Saturn or Uranus, it is very hard to see. It was originally named as \"1989 N1R\". The reason that the Adams ring is famous is that it has a feature that has not been seen on any other planetary rings. These are three long narrow \"arcs\" which are much brighter and look more solid than the rest of the ring system. Each one spans from 4-10\u00b0 of the whole ring. All the arcs are close to each other, spanning under 40\u00b0 of longitude, only about 1/8th of the edge of the ring. It has been a puzzle to understand why the stuff in these arcs does not spread out evenly through the whole ring.\nThe three arcs have been named with French names \"Libert\u00e9\", \"\u00c9galit\u00e9\", and \"Fraternit\u00e9\". These names came from the famous saying of the French Revolution, which translates into English as \"Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood!\". These names were suggested by the scientists who discovered them during \"stellar occultations\" in 1984 and 1985.\nFour of Neptune's 13 moons are inside the ring system. The one that is nearest to the Adam's ring is called Galatea. It is a lumpy mass of rock that orbits around the planet at about the same speed as the planet is rotating. It is about 1000 kilometers inside the ring.\nMany scientists now think that it is the effect of the moon Galatea that is causing the three arcs in the Adam's ring. The ring also has 42 wiggles, which are like waves 30 kilometers high. Scientists are able to use this information to work out the mass of the moon Galatea. .\nThe best photos that came back from Voyager 2 showed that there are clumps of particles in the rings, but no-one can tell whether they are made of fine dust, or if there may be bigger particles in the clumps as well. All of Neptune's rings have a lot of \"microscopic dust\" but particularly the arcs of the Adam's ring. Scientists know this because they looked very bright in the photos that Voyager 2 took with the sun shining behind them.\n There is much more dust in the rings of Neptune than there is in the rings of Saturn.\nThe Adams ring is very red. The background particles that make up the ring look twice as bright near the three arcs as they do on the side of the ring that is opposite the arcs.\nArc dynamics.\nWith the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and adaptive optics ground-based telescopes the ring arcs have been re-examined several times, starting in July 1998.\n This has showed that they are amazingly active, changing a lot over only a few years: Fraternit\u00e9 and \u00c9galit\u00e9 have been exchanging material and changing their lengths noticeably. Even more dramatically, Libert\u00e9 appears to be fading away, being only 30% of its original 1989 brightness in 2003, and hardly visible in Hubble Space Telescope images from June 2005. In the meantime, it seems to have gotten a split two-humped profile, and wandered several degrees closer to the more stable \u00c9galit\u00e9. Courage, a very small and dim arc during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998, while more recently it was back to its usual dimness but had advanced by an additional 8\u00b0 ahead of the other arcs. That is, it appears to have jumped over to the next stable corotation resonance position. There were also some suggestions that the ring arcs may have been normally fading away. However, visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately steady, but they are dimmer in the infra-red where previous observations were taken. This activity of the ring arcs is not currently understood.\nInner rings.\nIn addition to the outer Adams Ring, the other ring arrangements in the direction of Neptune's surface are:\nVoyager pictures appear to also suggest a wide disc of scattered material extending inside of the 50,000\u00a0km radius which surrounds the Galle ring, but is difficult to tell apart from Neptune's brightness, and for this reason its existence is uncertain.\nList of rings.\nThe rings are named after astronomers who made important discoveries to the study of Neptune.\nFour of Neptune's moons: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and Galatea orbit inside the ring system."}

Many hybrids are known, both naturally occurring and in cultivation, because willows are very fertile between their own species.\nWillows have watery bark sap, charged with salicylic acid (defence against herbivory). They have soft, usually pliant (bendy), tough wood, slender branches, and large, fibrous, often stoloniferous roots. The roots are remarkable for their toughness, size, and are hard to kill. Roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant.\nWillows are dioecious, with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on separate plants. The catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves."}

There are 15 species in 4 genera. The tallest is the sarus crane, \"Grus antigone\", which can grow to a height of up to 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft),\nCranes look a lot like herons but they are usually larger, and have a partly naked head, and a more heavy bill. When they are flying, their long neck is stretched out in front, and the legs trail out behind.\nThe earliest fossils of cranes were discovered in North America. Living forms are living everywhere all over the world except in Antarctica and South America. Many populations are endangered by hunting and habitat destruction.\nDescription.\nCranes are tall birds with long legs. Cranes are large birds, the world's tallest flying birds. They range in size from the demoiselle crane, which is 90 cm (35 in) in length, to the sarus crane, which may be up to 176 cm (69 in). The heaviest is the red-crowned crane, which can weigh 12 kg (26 lb) before migrating. They are usually brown, white, or gray in color. There are over 15 kinds of species of cranes. They look rather like herons. The whooping crane (\"Grus americana\") is the tallest American bird. Adults stand 5 feet tall and have a wingspan of up to 7 feet.\nLife.\nCranes are omnivores. They eat many kinds of plants, reptiles, small mammals, and other birds. The average life time of a crane is from 20 to 25 years. Cranes are highly social birds that live in large flocks. Some species of cranes are thought as holy in Asia, especially in Japan.\nReproduction.\nCranes usually build their nests in marshy areas and lay two eggs at a time. Cranes can make sounds that are heard from far away. Cranes dance special dances when they mate, and they include stepping quickly, high leaps, stretching, and bowing. Crane chicks grow very quickly and at two to four months, they develop their flight feathers. Cranes are very vocal. They use several different types of calls. They also communicate with their bodies.\nBehaviour.\nAll cranes are able to defend themselves quite well. They are mostly quite large, and peck, kick and batter opponents with their wings. They are territorial, and males will fight even more vigorously than usual at mating seasons. Zookeepers use acrylic riot shields to protect themselves against crane attacks.\nEvolution.\nCranes are an ancient type of wading bird. Their first definite fossils are in the Eocene epoch, The rails (family Rallidae) are their nearest relatives in the order Gruiformes. Most of the other groups in the Gruiformes are flightless birds. These lived in forests, and left little or no fossil record.\nThreatened.\nThe biggest threats to cranes are hunting and habitat destruction. Cranes need large habitats. All cranes are protected by international agreement."}
