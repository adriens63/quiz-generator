The town was named for Elizabeth, wife of governor George Carteret. The town served as the first capital of New Jersey. During the American Revolutionary War, there were over a hundred battles and skirmishes fought in and around Elizabeth.\nOn March 13, 1855, the City of Elizabeth was created by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature. On March 19, 1857, the city became part of the newly created Union County. Portions of the city were taken to form Linden Township on March 4, 1861.\nThe Singer Sewing Machine Company was the first major industry in Elizabeth. They had up to 2,000 workers. In 1895, one of the first car companies opened. This was the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company. They were soon joined by another electric car builder, Andrew L. Riker. The Electric Boat Company got its start building submarines for the United States Navy in Elizabeth. The first boat to launch was the USS \"Holland\" (SS-1) in 1897. Elizabeth grew in parallel to the larger city of Newark for many years. But Elizabeth has been more successful in retaining a middle class presence and was spared riots in the 1960s."}

PRK is especially preferred over LASIK for people with high prescriptions, thin corneas, and people who are more likely to get eye injuries, such as athletes or police officers. Potential side effects or complications include seeing haloes, starbursts, or glare, corneal haze, dry eye, infection, blurry vision, double vision, and the continued need for glasses or contact lenses. Side effects are more likely if an old or obsolete laser is used, which many clinics still use. Side effects are usually temporary but may become permanent. Some temporary side effects may be caused by the eye drops used, and not the surgery itself.\nProcedure.\nThe surgeon gives anesthetic drops in each eye, to prevent the patient from feeling pain. The epithelium (outer layer of the cornea) is brushed off, and the surgeon uses a laser to remove small amounts of the cornea, changing its shape. Mitomycin C is then applied to the eye, which helps prevent corneal haze. A bandage contact lens is then placed over the eye, and the epithelium grows back behind the contact lens. Vision will be blurry for a few days, and there will be some pain and discomfort. The recovery period is longer and more painful than LASIK. Several sets of eye drops, applied several times each day, are necessary for at least a week or longer. After about a week, the epithelium has grown back, and the surgeon removes the contact lens. The patient must sleep with a protective shield over the eyes until the contact lens is removed."}

The size increase can be as small as one cup size, or as large as 10 cup sizes or more. \nThe larger the increase, the greater the risk of complications. Complications may include leaking of the implants, which may require the implants to be replaced. With larger breasts the whole weight balance of the body is changed, which may cause stress to the muscular and skeletal systems. \nA surgical implant is either an implant filled with saline-solution, or an implant filled with silicone-gel. The fat-graft transfer uses grafts of adipose fat tissue from the woman\u2019s own body. A full assessment of this method is not yet available. The method does not allow for the huge size increase possible with implants, and slim women may not have enough fat tissue to allow the method to be used. \nMethods.\nSilicone and saline implants.\nImplants are inserted into the breast and filled with silicone or a saline solution. This is the most common method of augmentation.\nPolypropylene string implants.\nYarn-like polypropylene string is inserted into the breast, where it irritates the breast, causing it to fill with fluid. Polypropylene string produces very large size increases, often well over 20 cup sizes. It has a very high complication rate and is now banned in the United States and many other countries.\nFat grafting.\nFat is removed with liposuction from an area of the body where it is not desirable. The fat is then cleaned and injected into the breast."}

The NDP are represented by their groups in charge of the ridings in those territories (both Nunavut and the Northwest Territories each have one riding).

It was written for TV by Andy Breckman. It stars Tony Shalhoub. The show was on the air from July 2002 to December 2009. The last episode before the series was cancelled was one of the most-watched in cable television history. Other actors in the show were Bitty Schram, Jason Gray-Stanford, Ted Levine and Traylor Howard.\nStoryline.\nAdrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) had been a good detective for the San Francisco police department. After his wife Trudy was killed by a car bomb, Monk had a nervous breakdown. He was too upset and afraid to work. He was then let go by the police department.\nAfter that he stayed inside his house for many years. He finally began to go outside his house; but only with the help of his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). He could only go places when she went with him to protect him from his fears. This let him do some work as a private detective. He still has a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sometimes, the obsessive-compulsive disorder helps him figure out the answers to clues in cases. He has a great memory for details. Since he was a child, Monk has been able to notice small things that others miss.\nMonk has to have everything clean and spends a lot of his day cleaning over and over. He also has a fear of germs. He cleans his toothbrush with boiling water. He vacuums his walls and ceilings in his home.\nCaptain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall \"Randy\" Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) ask Monk for detective help when they can't figure out a crime scene. Stottlemeyer is usually frustrated by Monk's idiosyncrasies. But he respects Monk's amazing crime solving abilities.\nWhen Monk is not working, he tries to solve his wife's murder. He often works on cases that involve women or bombs, because it reminds him of his wife.\nIn the middle of Season 3, Monk's nurse, Sharona Fleming, decides to move back to New Jersey. Monk then hires another assistant. Her name is Natalie Teeger (played by Traylor Howard). Natalie has a daughter named Julie Teeger. Her husband was in the United States Navy and was killed in combat years earlier."}

The nickname for the creek comes from gases that bubbled out of the riverbed due to the decomposition of blood and entrails that were dumped in the river in the early 20th century by local meatpacking businesses that surrounded the Union Stock Yards.\nAuthor Upton Sinclair wrote an expos\u00e9 called \"The Jungle\", which was an unflattering portrait of the meat packing industry of America. In it, he wrote:\n\"\"\"Bubbly Creek\" is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the Union Stock Yards; all the drainage of the square mile of packing-houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily. The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out. Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterwards gathered it themselves. The banks of \"Bubbly Creek\" are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the packers gather and clean.\"\""}

It has the highest sexual dimorphism among other spiral-horned antelopes.\nThe nyala is mainly active early in the morning and late in the afternoon. As a herbivore, the nyala eats leaves, fruits and grasses. They prefer water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala is not a territorial animal. Family groups of up to 10 individuals can be found. Old males live alone but family groups of up to ten members live in thickets within dense and dry savanna woodlands. The main predators of the nyala are lion, leopard and Cape hunting dog, while baboons and raptors hunt for the young. Mating peaks during spring and autumn.\nNyalas live in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. They have been introduced to Botswana and Namibia, and reintroduced to Swaziland, where they became extinct in the 1950s. Populations are stable and are of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats to the species are poaching and habitat loss resulting from human settlement. The males are highly demanded as game animals in Africa."}

Most interstates have rest areas every few dozen miles.\nWhat is needed.\nTo be an Interstate Highway, there cannot be any stoplights. To get on or off the freeway, an interchange is needed. The speed limit is usually at least 55 miles per hour. It must have at least two lanes going each way. The lanes must be at least 12 feet wide. There has to be a median or barrier between cars going different directions.\nNumbering.\nNorth-south interstates have odd numbers. The numbers go up from west to east. East-west interstates have even numbers. The numbers go up from south to north. One and two digit freeways go long distances. Three digit freeways go into or around cities. Freeways that go into cites are called spur routes and start with an odd number. Freeways that go around cities are called loop routes and start with an even number. The last two digits in a spur or a loop route are the same as the freeway it started from."}

He is a member of the Democratic Party. On July 1, 2013, became mayor of Meridian, Mississippi.\nEarly life.\nBland was born in Crystal Springs, Mississippi on September 23, 1970. He grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. He attended St. Joseph High School. He earned a B.S. in Chemistry at Xavier University of New Orleans. He played collegiate basketball. Bland earned a Master\u2019s of Public Health (MPH) degree at the University of Southern Mississippi.\nCareer.\nBland went to work for the Fulton County Health Department in Atlanta, Georgia. There he was an epidemiologist in the Tuberculosis Control Department. Bland met his wife Deidre in Atlanta. They married on August 15, 1999. Deidre Bland is a teacher at Ross Collins in the Meridian Public School District. Bland returned to Mississippi and became the Human Resources Director and Marketing Director with the G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center. Bland moved to Meridian to run a State Farm Insurance Agency.\nCommunity involvement.\nIn 2007, Bland was co-chair to pass a bond issue for the first major renovations and improvements to Meridian\u2019s public schools in more than 20 years. The bond issue was for $19.5 million. The bond issue passed on March 27, 2007 with 71.3%.\nBland also helped establish the Magnolia Youth Sports Association. He still runs his own Summer Basketball Camp. Bland helped establish the First Tee Golf Program in Meridian, the first in the state, a golf program aimed at improving the quality of life of primarily inner-city children.\nMayor of Meridian.\nOn June 4, 2013, Bland won the election for mayor of Meridian by 54% of the vote. Before he took office, he formed a team from the community to study five issues and make recommendations about how to move improve those areas in Meridian. The areas are education, community development, public safety, infrastructure and city partnerships. Bland was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of the city of Meridian on July 1, 2013.\nDuring his first Meridian City Council meeting as mayor, on July 2, 2014, Bland proposed his livable wage policy. He proposed a $9 an hour minimum salary for all city employees. That was to be funded by money saved through cuts to other areas of the municipal budget. Bland's livable wage proposal became city policy when the city council passed the municipal budget on September 17, 2013.\nBland and several local businesses began recognizing an outstanding teacher or staff member from two MPSD schools a month during the 2013-14 school year. Improvements to public safety were made to the newly annexed part of Meridian. A new warning siren was put at the fire station in that area. Meridian youth sports were brought together through one program in the Meridian Parks and Recreation Department. The program brought in more mentors, more coaches, and more churches as partners for the City of Meridian to work with youth through athletics. In May 2014, the City of Meridian pledged $750,000 to help build a new community center.\nIn May 2014, the City of Meridian launched a series of new programs to help fight crime in the city. These included a new gang task force, a new team of Meridian police officers and citizens to help with tips on crime, and penalizing parents when their children do not comply with the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law."}

During World War II was drafted into the Soviet Red Army, where he was captured as a German prisoner of war.\nWorld War II.\nAlthough he was a survivor of the notorious Nazi concentration camps system, he was convicted in 2011 in Germany for alleged war crimes as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews while acting as a guard named Ivan Demjanjuk at the Nazi extermination camp near Sobib\u00f3r in occupied Poland. Since his conviction was pending appeal at the time of his death, Demjanjuk remains innocent under German law, and his earlier conviction is invalidated. According to the Munich state court, Demjanjuk does not have a criminal record.\nLife in the United States.\nIn 1952 he emigrated from West Germany to the United States, and was granted citizenship in 1958 whereupon he formally anglicized his name from \"Ivan\" to \"John\".\nDeportation.\nIn 1986 he was deported to Israel to stand trial for war crimes, after being identified by eleven Holocaust survivors, many from Israel, as \"Ivan the Terrible\", a notorious guard at the Treblinka extermination camp in Nazi occupied Poland. Demjanjuk was accused of committing murder and acts of extraordinarily savage violence against camp prisoners during 1942\u201343. He was convicted of having committed crimes against humanity and sentenced to death there in 1988.\nThe verdict was overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993, based on new evidence that \"Ivan the Terrible\" was probably another man, Ivan Marchenko. After the trial, in September 1993, he returned to his home in Ohio. In 1998 his citizenship was restored after a United States federal appeals court ruled that prosecutors had suppressed exculpatory evidence concerning his identity.\nLater charges.\nIn 2001 Demjanjuk was charged again, this time on the grounds that he had, instead, served as a guard named Ivan Demjanjuk at the Sobibor and Majdanek camps in Nazi occupied Poland and at the Flossenb\u00fcrg camp in Germany. Demjanjuk became again a stateless person in 2002 (until his death in 2012). His deportation was again ordered in 2005, but after exhausting his appeals in 2008 he still remained in the United States, as no country would agree to accept him at that time.\nOn 2 April 2009, it was announced that Demjanjuk would be deported to Germany, where he would stand trial, since in a bid to disassociate from the nation's past, Germany began the policy of prosecuting prisoners of war from other nations whom the German Nazis made the accessories to their crimes. On 11 May, Demjanjuk left his Cleveland home by ambulance, and was taken to the airport, where he was deported by plane, arriving in Germany the next morning. On 13 July, he was formally charged with 27,900 counts of acting as an accessory to murder, one for each person who died at Sobibor during the time he was alleged to have served as a guard. On 30 November, Demjanjuk's trial began in Munich.\nConvictions.\nOn 12 May 2011, Demjanjuk was convicted pending appeal by an ordinary German criminal court as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews at Sobibor and sentenced to five years in prison. The interim conviction was later annulled, because Demjanjuk died before his appeal could be heard. He was later released pending trial and final verdict by the German Appellate Court.\nDeath.\nHe lived at a German nursing home in Bad Feilnbach, where he died on 17 March 2012. Despite decades of legal wrangling and controversy, Demjanjuk died a free man and legally innocent."}

A package manager made only for Arch Linux named \"pacman\" can be used to install, remove and update packages of software on the computer.\nHistory.\nArch Linux was inspired by CRUX, another minimalist Linux distribution.\nOriginally, Arch Linux was only for 32-bit x86 systems, but 64-bit was supported in April 2006. In January 2017, 32-bit support was discontinued, but a derivative by the community called Arch Linux 32 has been produced for 32-bit systems.\nInstallation.\nUnlike other Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Arch Linux's installation requires the user to enter commands manually. This can be scary for beginners, but the wiki suggests that new users can still install Arch Linux by investing time and effort.\nPackage Management.\nPacman is the official package manager of Arch Linux. It was written in the C programming language by Judd Vinet. The package manager handles all the packages on the system, and does installation, removal, upgrades, and more.\nAs a rolling release system, Arch Linux's repositories are being constantly updated.\nArch Build System (ABS).\nThe Arch Build System is a system that automatically makes packages from a PKGBUILD file.

The lyrics for the song were written by guitarist Kim Thayil and the music was written by drummer Matt Cameron.\nLead guitarist Kim Thayil said of the song: \nI really liked the music to the song and it needed words, and since no one else pursued it, I decided to. It's not really about things that have actually happened to me. It's more about experience in general. I've heard a lot of good ideas from people telling me what it's about.

This has obvious advantages, especially it helps animals find food.\nThe colour vision of many herbivores allows them to see fruit or (immature) leaves which are good to eat. In hummingbirds, particular flowers are often recognized by colour. Predators also use colour vision to help them find their prey.\nAll this applies mainly to animals in the daytime. On the other hand, nocturnal mammals have much less-developed colour vision. For them, space on the retina is better used with more rods since rods collect light better. Colour differences are much less visible in the dark.\nArthropods.\nApart from vertebrates, the only land animals to have colour vision are arthropods. Aquatic arthropods such as crustacea also have colour vision. As with vertebrates, the details differ, but the molecules which do the work the opsins \u2013 are very similar.\nVertebrates.\nFour photopigment opsins exist in teleost fish, reptiles and birds. This suggests that the common ancestor of tetrapods and amniotes (~360 million years ago) had:\nMammals.\nIn contrast, mammals lost much of their colour vision capability during the long period in the Mesozoic when they lived as nocturnal animals. \nMany primates do live as daytime animals, and one group \u2013 the Old World monkeys \u2013 has developed trichromatic vision. The anthropoid apes and humans are descended from this group of monkeys, and also have good colour vision. So it comes about that most monkeys and humans have good colour vision, but most other eutherian mammals do not: They have only two opsins, and so they are \"bichromatic\".\nUV light.\nUltraviolet light plays a part in colour perception in many animals, especially insects.\nColour vision, with UV discrimination, is present in many arthropods\u2014the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to have this trait.\nBirds, turtles, lizards, many fish and some rodents have UV receptors in their retinas. These animals can see the UV patterns found on flowers and other wildlife that are otherwise invisible to the human eye."}

Dravidians are linked to the neolithic Zagros Mountain farmers, and this West Asian population forms the main ancestor of modern South Asians.\nA genetic and biogeographical study (Das et al. 2016) concluded that Dravidian peoples belong to the Caucasoid race. According to the study, these proto-Dravidians migrated into India around 8,000 years ago from a region later known as Elam in modern day Iran. The authors suggest that this results support the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis.\nThe Indus Valley civilization is suggested to be of Dravidian origin. Genetic tests show that the ancient Indus Valley Civilization was predominantly of neolithic Zagros mountain farmers ancestry (98%) and this ancestry component is linked to early Dravidians.\nToday.\nToday there are around 220 million Dravidian speakers worldwide. Most live in South India. Others live in parts of Central India, Eastern India, Bangladesh, Southern Pakistan, Sri Lanka the Maldives and Nepal. The biggest groups of Dravidians are the Tamil people, Telugu people, Kannada people, and the Malayali people.

Females also have horns, but they are thinner and shorter. Mountain gazelles are sexually dimorphic, which means that males are larger than females. Male can weigh from 17-29.5 kg. Females can weigh 16\u201325 kg. Mountain gazelles can run up to 80 km/h (50 mph).\nHabitat.\nGazelles have adapted to live in dry, desert-like places. They spend most of their time at the top of mountains and hills. Mountain gazelles prefer to sleep on the tops of hills/mountains to avoid the heat in the day. Around dawn and dusk, they will be found leaving the hills to eat in light forests, fields, or desert plateaus.\nFeeding.\nIt is a grazing species, though this varies with the amount of food available. They can survive for a long time without a source of water. During that time, they get freshwater from succulent plants and dew from plants."}

In 1989, the AMCU changed its name to the Mid-Continent Conference, or MCC (those initials, however, were also being used by the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, now the Horizon League).\nThe Mid-Continent saw many changes in the first part of the 1990s, with the biggest coming in 1992 and 1994. In 1992, the conference added women's sports after it absorbed the North Star Conference, a league that only sponsored women's sports. Then in 1994, six schools (including three charter members) left for the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. They were replaced by six other schools, five of them coming from the collapsed East Coast Conference. None of the schools that joined in 1994 are now in the league.\nSince the 1994 changes, the conference has had anywhere from 8 to 10 members.

One plays three sports in the conference and three more house one sport in the conference. (Note that the NCAA counts men's and women's teams in the same sport as playing two different sports, and also considers swimming and diving to be a single sport.)\nFormer members.\nNo fewer than 22 schools have been full members, but are no longer in the league."}

Henry became King Henry III of Navarre and King Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon king of France. She became the Duchess of Vend\u00f4me by that marriage.\nJeanne was the acknowledged spiritual and political leader of the French Huguenot movement, and a key figure in the French Wars of Religion.\nFirst marriage.\nAs a girl, she had a remarkably strong character. Her parents wanted her to marry William \"the Rich\", Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg. He was the brother of Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England. She was 12 or 13 at the time, quite normal then for a girl's marriage.\nShe refused, and her mother had her whipped. The whipping was extremely severe, but the girl continued to resist the marriage. Finally, she was carried bodily to the altar by the Constable of France, and married against her will.\nEvidently she still continued her resistance, because the marriage was eventually annulled on the grounds of non-consummation.\nSecond marriage.\nHer second marriage was also a political marriage. Its intent was to unify territory in the south and north of France. However, this time there was love involved. A contemporary wrote \"she had no pleasure or occupation except in talking about or writing to [her husband]. She does it in company and in private . . . the waters cannot quench the flame of her love\".\nThe couple had five children, two of whom survived to adult life.\nQueen of Navarre.\nOn 25 May 1555, Henry II of Navarre died, at which time Jeanne and her husband became joint rulers of Navarre. Jeanne and Antoine were crowned in a joint ceremony according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church on 18 August 1555 at Pau.\nJeanne's husband died on 17 November 1562, so for the last ten years of her life she was the sole ruler of Navarre.\nReligion.\nDuring Jeanne's life, religion in France was a battleground between the Catholic church and the Protestant Calvinism of the Huguenots.\nIn religion Jeanne was influenced by her mother, towards religious reform, humanist thinking, and individual liberty. Jeanne converted to Calvinism on Christmas Day 1560. This conversion made her the highest-ranking Protestant in France.\nFollowing the imposition of Calvinism in her kingdom, priests and nuns were banished, Catholic churches destroyed, and Catholic ritual prohibited. She commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and B\u00e9arnese for the benefit of her subjects.\nShe was described as \"small of stature, frail but erect\". She was highly intelligent, but austere and self-righteous. Agrippa d' Aubign\u00e9, the Huguenot chronicler, described Jeanne as having \"a mind powerful enough to guide the highest affairs\".\nIn addition to her religious reforms, Jeanne worked on reorganising her kingdom; making long-lasting reforms to the economic and judicial systems of her domains.\nJeanne died in Paris from a fever (probably an infectious disease) at the age of 44."}

In research, tertiary sources are used as a guide to help find primary and secondary sources of information. Tertiary sources are very useful to find search terms for online literary searches. While tertiary sources are easy to find they are usually not considered useful for college-level research projects.\nExamples.\nSome examples of tertiary sources are encyclopedias, dictionaries, newspapers and Magazines. Encyclopedias are useful to gain a general overview of a subject. At best they are a starting point in doing research. They are useful to gain an immediate understanding of otherwise unfamiliar subjects. Encyclopedias, however, are not usually a reliable source for the details of a subject. As your research progresses they should be replaced with secondary or primary sources. Newspapers and magazines should be used with some caution. Some are reliable but many tend to misrepresent or oversimplify research reported in secondary sources. \nSecondary or tertiary?\nThe distinction between sources can be relative to a specific field of study. In some academic disciplines the distinction between a secondary and tertiary source can sometimes be confusing. Almanacs, fact books and handbooks can at times be considered tertiary while at other times secondary sources. Some manuals and textbooks would be considered tertiary sources while others would be secondary sources. Many of these sources have to be evaluated or vetted to determine which they are. Another view taken by the Purdue University guide (\"Writing a research paper\", 2010) refers to the \"distance\" a source is from the original research. A primary source \"is\" the research; the raw data. A secondary source reports on primary sources and includes interpretation (or explanations), analysis and commentary. A tertiary source is the furthest from the original research. In most cases their purpose is to provide a general introduction to a topic. In many scholarly fields, tertiary sources are not used for research."}

Because there are other blights of potatoes, this one is sometimes called late blight of potato.\nThe infestation caused widespread famine. It was caused by an oomycete \"Phytophthora infestans\". The oomycetes or water moulds have many features which are similar to fungi, but they are in a different Kingdom.\nOverview.\n\"Phytophthora infestans\" in Ireland caused over one million to starve to death and another two million people emigrated from affected countries. During the 1840s the blight damaged crops in Scotland and Europe also. It was the only important cash crop in Ireland, which explains its greater effect there. Also, most of the Irish crop was one variety, the Irish Lumper.\nThe first recorded instances of the disease were in the United States, in Philadelphia and New York City in early 1843. It crossed the Atlantic Ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for Belgian farmers in 1845. All of the potato-growing countries in Europe were affected, but the potato blight hit Ireland the hardest. The lack of genetic variability created a susceptible host population for the organism.\nGenetic engineering.\nGenetic engineering for resistant cultivars is developing. A resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been found in a wild relative of the potato. It is introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato."}

This is important because it was not known whether this group had proto-feathers. These structures probably had the function of temperature regulation: they were not flight feathers.\nThe original specimen was a partial skull with lower jaws. The volcanic ash layers of the formation form a \"Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte\" with exceptional preservation. From 2010 onwards, more fossil material has been discovered, including subadult and juvenile individuals.\nFeatures of the body surface.\nSpecimens show large parts of its body surface (skin or 'integuent'). There are rows of scales on top of its tail and a covering of scales branching into feather-like structures. Until its discovery proto-feathers were thought to be only in the Theropoda. The feather remains discovered are of three types. \nThe first type consists of hair-like filaments covering the trunk, neck and head. These are up to three centimetres long and resemble the \"dino-fuzz\" already known from theropods like \"Sinosauropteryx\". The second type shows groups of 1.5 centimetres-long filaments, each group coming from a base plate. These are on the upper arm and thigh. The base plates are ordered in a hexagonal pattern but do not touch each other. The third type is unique. It was found on the upper lower legs and consists of bundles of six or seven ribbon-like structures, up to two centimetres long. Each ribbon is made from about ten parallel filaments up to 0.1 millimetres wide.\nThe filaments earlier reported in Ornithischia, on \"Psittacosaurus\" and \"Tianyulong\", could be homologous to the \"protofeathers\" found in non-avian theropods. This would imply that feathers are original to the Dinosauria as a whole and possibly to the Archosauria as a whole, since there are similar structures in the Pterosauria.\nThere are also three types of scales. Overlapping hexagonal scales, up to 3.5 millimetres in diameter, are present on the lower shins. Small round non-overlapping scales, less than one millimetre in cross-section, cover the hands, ankles and feet. The top of the tail is covered by five long rows of arched rectangular scales, measuring up to one by two centimetres. With these scales the trailing edge of each scale slightly overlaps the front edge of the scale behind it. In the middle, to the contrary, a small spur projects forward, covering the trailing edge of the preceding scale. The authors think the scales were not ossified scutes or osteoderms."}

The BJS was a political party created by Syama Prasad Mookerjee in 1951. At that time, the Indian National Congress was the political party that ruled India. The BJS's goal was to stop the Indian National Congress's policies. \nMany people thought the BJS was part of the RSS because they had the same ideologies on leading the Government of India.\nCampaign for Kashmir.\nThe party's first election campaign was about Kashmir. Kashmir was an area divided between India and Pakistan(2393squareKm). The BJS wanted to make Kashmir a part of India. The party's founder, Mookerjee, was arrested for protesting in Kashmir, when he was ordered not to do so. He died in prison, so Deendayal Upadhyay became the party's leader.\nEven though there was slight public support for the party because of the campaign about Kashmir, the BJS only managed to win three seats in the Lok Sabha in the 1952 elections.\nLater elections.\nIn the 1967 Indian elections, many political parties, including the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, joined up together to win a majority of the seats of many Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time the BJS had held any political office. In 1977, after the end of a State of Emergency declared by the Congress Government, BJS joined with several other parties to form BJP.\nIn 1996 BJP became the largest party in Parliament. It did poorly in the 2004 elections and became the major opposition party. The 2014 elections gave BJP enough seats to form a government."}

{"id": "458432", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458432", "title": "The Weather Channel", "text": "The Weather Channel is a cable and satellite television channel that is shown in the United States. The Weather Channel broadcasts weather newsshows and recorded weather-related documentaries 24 hours a day. The Weather Channel is most often filmed inside a studio near Atlanta, but some people working there sometimes go out to the place where the storm or weather is happening to film it. The Weather Channel also provides weather forecasts to over 700 radio stations, 50 newspapers, 30 websites, as well as mobile applications for smartphones and tablet computers. The Weather Channel is similar to a channel called The Weather Network in Canada.\nHistory.\nPrior to the channel's launch, the original concept for providing continuous weather reports to the public over television stations stretched as far back as the late 1950s and early 1960s on the varying incarnations of CATV. Through those systems, which typically brought in up to a dozen stations to the viewer from across the region, twelve slots on a cable dial would often leave a few vacancies.\nEarly cable providers then devised a system where a single black and white camera, often one that was formerly used for local news production after an upgrade, would be placed on a rotating pedestal, capturing various dials and gauges on different stations to which it would pan automatically and remain in a given view for a few seconds before moving on. The different stations featured the time, temperature, barometer, wind speed, wind direction, and wind chill factor. Slides with the day's complete forecast, brief news headlines and community events often drawn up by the station's art department rounded out the package. This was the same system as that used by the early Devotional Channels and for the Stations of the Cross during the Christmas season.\nThe Weather Channel itself was the brainchild of veteran television meteorologist John Coleman (former chief meteorologist at WLS-TV in Chicago and Good Morning America forecaster), who took his idea to Frank Batten, the then-chief executive officer of Landmark Communications. A major part of the plan for the new network was that it would be able to provide localized weather information to its viewers. This would be done through the use of specialized computer units, known as WeatherStars (\"STAR\" being an acronym for \"Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver\"), which would be installed at the headends of cable providers that agreed to carry the channel. These WeatherStars were able to insert current local conditions, forecasts and weather warnings over the national feed, with the weather data being received from the vertical blanking interval of the TWC video feed and via satellite, which is then transmitted to the WeatherStar unit; the WeatherStar systems would also be capable of adding or removing segments seen during each local forecast segment, and providing other forms of non-forecast data (primarily local contact and address information for businesses advertised on the channel's national feed, which the STAR unit overlaid on a static graphic seen after certain commercials). The Weather Channel, Inc. was founded in Atlanta, Georgia on July 18, 1980.\nThe Weather Channel launched on Sunday, May 2, 1982. Programming began with an introduction to the channel by Batten and Coleman, which led into an inauguration ceremony that launched the channel's first official broadcast at 8pm that evening, anchored by meteorologists Bruce Edwards and Andr\u00e9 Bernier. The bulk of TWC programming consisted of a local forecast segment 8-12 times hourly. The Weather Channel originally gathered its national and regional forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its local forecasts were sourced from the various National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices around the country. The first slogan was unveiled: \"We Take the Weather Seriously, But Not Ourselves.\"\nHowever, after only one year in the role, in 1983, John Coleman was forced out as the channel's president and CEO; at that time, he returned to his previous occupation as a television weathercaster, first becoming employed at WCBS-TV in New York City. Slogan was also updated to \"The Cable Television Network for America's Lifestyle.\" This only stayed for a year, before moved to \"Weatherproofing America.\"\nThe original Weather Star I model often interfered with the channel 2 signal at the cable headend; this issue was fixed with the upgrade to the Weather Star II in January 1984. The channel later rolled out Weather Star III, the third-generation STAR unit, to cable providers \u2013 which began upgrading to the system in early 1986; the Star III included additional hardware improvements, and also added several extra forecast and observation features.\nIn 3/1986, The Weather Channel launched its fourth slogan: \"You Need Us for Everything you Do\" and a campaign to promote this. It included a custom lyrical theme (which was remixed in 1989) \u2013 two versions of which were created: a full one-minute theme that was rarely seen on-air, and a more commonly seen 30-second version. In 1989, the channel introduced \"Prime Time Tonight\", a 3-minute segment that appeared 8 times nightly from 7:57 to 11:27 p.m., which served as guide to programs airing on other cable channels and provided airtime information and video clips.\n1990 saw the introduction of the first Weather Star 4000 models, which similar to the Weather Star III, originally generated only text-based products. Radar imagery was added to the units in June of that year, with graphical backgrounds being introduced in July, making the 4000 the first STAR to be capable of generating graphics and the first to incorporate the channel's logo in the forecast segments. Also in 1990, The Weather Channel began including snow condition reports at five minutes after the hour.\nLargely considered the height of the classic TWC by enthusiasts, The Weather Channel underwent a major graphical revamp (with the introduction of a new slogan, \"Weather You Can Always Turn To\") on March 6, 1991. Graphic elements included heavy use of gradients and the Caxton typeface. On July 3, The Weather Channel Connection, a toll-free phone service providing weather information, was launched. Originally 1-900-288-8800, the phone number was reassigned in 1992 to 1-900-WEATHER (or 1-900-932-8437), a number was also used to promote the service in on-air and print advertisements. On November 1, The Weather Channel filed for a trademark on TWC, a common shortening of the name that was sometimes seen on-air.\nBy 1993, The Weather Channel was available to 90% of U.S. households with cable television service. On January 10, 1994, TWC placed an order to build 1,000 units for a new STAR model known as the Weather Star Jr, a budget model developed by Wegener Communications, which builds equipment for cable headends.\n1995 brought a variety of changes to TWC, setting the stage for more changes that occurred the following year. Minor graphical tweaks were made, while local forecast segments began incorporating Short Term Forecasts issued by local National Weather Service offices as the \"Local Update\" (which in turn destabilized flavor lineups and caused the discontinuation of narration). The 30-Day Outlook was discontinued (which was required by National Weather Service). New programs included the introductions of \"WeatherScope\" (a half-hourly weather discussion) and a special on how weather affected the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7. That year also featured the premiere of \"Sky on Fire\", a documentary on lightning. The music of Trammell Starks, used on Weatherscan and emergency cases since 2000, premiered at the end of the year with Starks' various other music pieces being used by the channel until early 2012.\nFrom 1996 to 1998, The Weather Channel dramatically changed its on-air presentation. The first wave of change came in October 1996, with the introduction of a new slogan (\"No Place on Earth Has Better Weather\"), that was heralded with a trio of humorous spots (blizzard/breezy/flood) promoting the accuracy of TWC's weather coverage. Months later, The Weather Channel received its biggest graphical overhaul since 1991, the modernization of TWC's presentation included the introduction of a newer, flatter logo (although its previous logo remained in use on some segments, and some specialty segments retained narration by Dan Chandler and/or the previous TWC logo into late 1997), as well as a new graphics package featuring rotating globes and compass points for introductions, and new music. 1996 also saw the launch of The Weather Channel's website, weather.com. \"Local on the 8s\", a concept in which local forecasts aired in ten-minute intervals at times ending in \"8,\" also made its debut.\nOn October 15, 1996, Landmark Communications purchased a building at 300 Interstate North (near the junction of Interstates 75 and 285 in Atlanta) to house The Weather Channel's operations. Landmark had been looking for new studio facilities for the channel, and requirements included 18-foot ceilings. Improvements were made to bring the building up to code before TWC moved into its new headquarters at the end of 1996 (but it did not begin broadcasting from the facility until early 1997). By 1996, The Weather Channel reached 63 million homes, with average ratings totaling at 130,000 viewers at that time.\nOn March 31, 1997, the channel revised its programming schedule with the introduction of a news wheel format. On August 25, the channel debuted a memorable advertising campaign, \"The Front\", created by ad agency TBWA Chiat/Day. The promos (which used the slogan, \"Weather Fans, You're Not Alone\") were set in something akin to a sports bar, with the major difference being that weather was the central focus. That October, 1997 World Series became the first major event that TWC covered with live reporters. New title bars were introduced for national segments on January 6, 1998.\nIn March 1998, TWC introduced a graphical refresh, featuring heavy use of the Akzidenz-Grotesk typeface and footage of clouds at the core of the new identity. For the first time in the channel's history, there was no slogan or unifying theme. \"WeatherScope\" was replaced with \"Weather Center\" on March 10, a program which essentially comprised The Weather Channel's entire 24-hour daily programming schedule at the time in the form of three separate programs (\"Weather Center AM\", a morning program (5 a.m.-noon) focusing primarily on business, commuter and leisure travel weather; Weather Center PM, an evening program (7 p.m.-5 a.m.) with a focus on forecasts for the day ahead; and an afternoon broadcast (12 p.m.-7 p.m.) simply using the Weather Center title, which focused on ongoing weather conditions). April 1998 saw updates to \"The Front\" image campaign; one of the new advertisements specifically mentioned the 36-hour text forecasts (which, at the time, were still supplied by the National Weather Service), but heralded new Local Forecast graphics. The machine that produced those graphics, the IRIX-based Weather Star XL, was released to cable providers later that year as the first new mainline STAR unit manufactured in eight years. The catalyst for a top-to-bottom modernization of the local forecast segment, the XL's graphical and technological capabilities were significantly more advanced than the 4000, with an animated, high-quality output consistent with TWC's national graphics and new scalable icons that would be used for eight years on TWC (these icons remain in use by Weather Star XLs still in service and on certain downloadable web widgets).\n1999 brought the removal of the unpredictable-length Local Update product on the Weather Star 4000, which stabilized flavor lineups. Also in March 31 that year, The Weather Channel launched a spin-off network called Weatherscan Local, a channel offering continuous weather information 24/7, which exclusively provided local forecasts generated by specialized STAR units. Originally exclusive to Comcast systems, cable operators could add optional packages featuring expanded weather information or specialty forecasts (such as golf, boat and beach, or marine weather) to their Weatherscan STAR systems. The Weather Channel also appointed Decker Anstrom to serve as president of the network. By 1999, The Weather Channel reached 70 million homes, or 98% of all households that subscribe to cable television. It also provided weather forecasts to 52 newspapers and 250+ radio stations. Between 1999 and 2000, TWC aired weather observation reports from Mount Everest using battery-powered sensors.\nIn 2000, the channel's Weather Star XL systems introduced an audio function, Vocal Local, which assembles narration tracks heard during local forecast segments to introduce forecast products, and read descriptive forecasts and primary weather observations; while most cable operators added the Vocal Local feature, some did not employ it on their Weather Star XL units. The cycling of music playlist changes was increased from a quarterly to a monthly basis; as such, 2000 is considered to be the year the split between the \"classic\" TWC and \"modern\" TWC occurred by several websites. On August 23 of that year, the channel debuted \"Atmospheres\", a weekly newsmagazine-style program hosted by Jim Cantore and Mishelle \"Mish\" Michaels. It aired Wednesdays at 8pm, Saturdays at 5pm, and Sundays at 8pm and 11pm. Encore editions were aired on Saturday and Sunday at reverse time.\nOn January 3, 2000, The Weather Channel began reducing \"Weather Center\"'s broadcasting time. The first news program to be broadcast was titled \"Your Weather Today\", airing weekdays from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. Presenters were Heather Tesch and Marshall Seese.\nOn March 20, 2000, another weather news program was unveiled, titled \"First Outlook\", airing for two hours right after \"Your Weather Today\". On-air team was Rick Griffin and Cheryl Lemke, along with travel analyst Dennis Smith.\nOn April 21, 2001, \"Weekend Now\" was the first news programme to cut into the weekend timeslot of \"Weather Center\". It aired from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays, presented by two teams of meteorologists: one was Kelly Cass and Bill Keneely and the other team was Melissa Barrington and Bob Stokes. Any given hour of the program would be hosted by one team while a member of the other team provided special segments like \"Travel Forecast\" (other cities' forecasts) and \"Weather Maker\" (details behind the day's most important wearher system).\nIn June 2001, \"Weather Center\"'s name no longer featured the \"AM/PM\" distinction.\nOn August 20, 2001, \"Evening Edition\" dropped the 9 p.m.-5 a.m. block of \"Weather Center\". Because of long-form programs, Evening Edition aired its first hour, then long-form programs, then two hours, then long-form programs repeated from earlier, followed by the overnight hour, and finally this final hour was repeated twice. The show was presented by various meteorologists. In 2003, 4:30-7 a.m. weekend block now showed \"Weekend Outlook\", which presented by Ray Stagich only. (In case of severe weather, the show would start from 3 a.m, and another meteorologist would join him). Also at this year, 7-11 a.m. weekend block had a new show: \"Weekend Planner\", so \"Weekend Now\" moved to the 11 a.m.-2 p.m. block instead (this time, less special segments than before). As a result of these changes, \"Weather Center\" aired from 9 a.m.-9 p.m. weekdays and 2 p.m.-5 a.m. weekends.\nIn October 2002, Kim Cunningham left \"Evening Edition\" for \"First Outlook\".\nOn September 29, 2003, \"PM Edition\" was launched, interrupted the block of \"Weather Center\". It aired weekdays between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., presented by Carl Parker and Kristina Abernathy. It was preceded by another all-new show, \"Afternoon Outlook\" from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. At the same day, one more forecast program was launched, \"Day Planner\" from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. As a result, it could be known as weekday edition of \"Weekend Now\", as both shows aired at the same timeslot.\nOn October 4, 2003, \"PM Edition Weekend\" was launched, airing at a late night time: 11 p.m.-2 a.m. Two presenters were Adam Berg and Betty Davis."}

It was the sixteenth roller coaster that was built at the park. It was the first roller coaster to be over tall and was the tallest roller coaster in the world before its record was broken by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure when it opened in May 2005. Top Thrill Dragster, along with Kingda Ka, are the only strata coasters in the world.\nThe ride.\nAfter it leaves the station, the train enters the launch area. To the left of the launch area is a \"Christmas tree\" light, which is similar to a Christmas tree light at a drag strip. A message is then played to riders: \"Keep arms down, head back, and hold on.\" Once the train is ready to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. The train is then launched from the track at a speed of in 3.8 seconds. After it reaches its top speed, it goes up at a 90 degree angle and climbs a hill, or top hat element. Once it goes down, the track twists 270 degrees before it levels out, and then it is stopped by magnetic brakes.\nProblems.\nSometimes, a train does not have enough speed to go over the hill. This is known as a rollback, and it usually happens during cool, wet, or breezy weather. It can also happen when the wind is blowing against the train. In these conditions, the launch doesn't give the train enough speed to go over the hill, which causes it to stop before reaching the top of the hill and then roll back down the hill, which is why it is called a rollback.\nOn extremely rare occasions, the train may stall at the top of the hill. When this happens, a mechanic takes an elevator to the top of the hill and pushes the train forward down the hill. This has only happened three times with passengers on board the train, June 24, 2005, October 25, 2008, and May 25, 2009."}

Another word to describe a sock puppet would be alter ego. Often, a sock puppet identity is used to promote ideas or gather intelligence anonymously. Very often, they are used by individuals on the Internet praising themselves while pretending to be someone else. Politicians have frequently been accused of using sock puppets. sockpuppets are designed to create political mischief (making fun of an opponent's position for example). It can make it appear many people hold a certain opinion, when in fact that is false. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.\nHistory.\nThe term \"sockpuppet\" was used as early as July 9, 1993. By 1996 it was in general use. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" at first defined it as \"a person whose actions are controlled by another\". In 2000 the U.S. News and World Report associated the word minion with a sock puppet. In 2006, an aide to a Republican congressman was caught posting messages on Democratic Party sites. Using a false identity the aide was trying to convince Democrats not to support a certain candidate.\nMeatpuppet.\nA meatpuppet is similar to a sockpuppet, except a person joins users to a website, such as Wikipedia, to be used with sockpuppet behaviors. Such users are actually real individuals that come to support another user. If a person uses real people to create accounts that support that person's opinions, this form of meatpuppetry is often called \"astroturfing\", a type of false impression of support."}

{"id": "458717", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458717", "title": "Knowledge of results", "text": "Knowledge of results is a term in the psychology of learning.p619 A psychology dictionary defines it as feedback of information:\nIt describes the situation where a subject gets information which helps them to change behaviour in a desirable way, or to gain understanding. A primitive example is avoiding a behaviour after punishment. An advanced example is the way a human may improve understanding and behaviour after a teacher explains what was wrong with the previous effort.\nThere are a number of similar terms in psychology, but all of them have some problems.\nSo, knowledge of results, or sometimes \"immediate\" knowledge of results, is a useful term. It can be used for any learning where a student (or any animal) gets information after the action. The information is about how satisfactory the action is.\nExperimental evidence.\nAn early experiment on knowledge of results was the machine invented by Sidney Pressey, where a device both tested and taught multiple-choice questions. Note that this method tells the user (by inference) only whether the choice was correct or not. Since the material was multiple choice items, it was only intended as an addition to collecting classroom test scores.\nLater work in training research and education used the term \"knowledge of results\" frequently.\nAn important question was whether scores would be improved more if direct teaching was given either before or after the question was asked. The answer in both cases was (broadly) yes. Using instructional films, Michael and Maccoby split groups into two halves. Half the students were given material which required active, explicit responses. After a pause, they were told the correct answer. The other half was not given feedback. Instructional time was identical. The result showed a \"slight but significant gain\" for the active-response procedure without feedback, but more gain when feedback was provided. The experimenters later described this as \"KCR\" rather than \"feedback\". Research on the active response itself is summarised in p614. Later discussion of experiments like these suggested that the results might be due to practice rather than feedback. Undoubtedly, the set-up had given extra practice on the questions as well as knowledge of results. In technical terms, the experiments had confounded the two factors.\nAnother factor is that knowledge of results may give information to the instructor as to ways the material can be improved. Using a teaching program on decimal arithmetic, an experienced teacher can put student mistakes into types. For example, one group of mistakes are due to the learners not understanding the rules about placement of the point in decimal multiplication. This shows where and how the learning material needs to be revised.\nConscious thought not always essential.\nConscious thought is not necessary for knowledge of results to have its effect. Research on implicit learning shows that complex information can be got by humans without their awareness. This is also shown by experiments on animal learning which show the effects of knowledge of results on later behaviour. It seems likely that unconscious learning by results evolved first in early metazoa, and conscious thought very much later. This is what Reber calls the \"primacy of the implicit\", meaning implicit (unconscious) learning came first in evolution."}

He became one of the FBI's \"Public Enemies\" in the 1930s. He and a partner in crime were shot dead in an ambush by FBI agents in downtown Bangor, Maine in 1937. \nBiography.\nAl Brady was born in Indiana in 1910. Both his parents died while he was still young. At age 18, he committed his first robbery in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was shot and wounded. After getting out of jail, he got together with a gang. Using guns, they stole cars and robbed places in Indiana; mostly grocery stores. They murdered a 23-year-old Indianapolis store clerk. Then they killed an Indianapolis policeman. After probably killing another police officer, the gang was put in jail in 1936. Brady and some of the gang escaped from jail and robbed a bank in Goodland, Indiana. While running away, they killed one policeman and injured another.\nGun fight and death.\nBrady and his gang ended up hiding out in Bangor, Maine. They had about $5,000 left from their robberies. Brady thought Maine would be an easy place to get guns and ammunition without questions being asked. This was because there are many deer and bear hunters in the area.\nIn Bangor, Brady began trying to buy automatic weapons at Dakin's Sporting Goods store, in downtown Bangor. On Sept. 21, 1937, Brady asked the owner, Everett Hurd, for 500 rounds of 30 calibre ammunition. Seeing a large amount of cash, the store owner became suspicious. Hurd called the police after taking their order. He told them to return in a few weeks to pick up their guns. \nBrady and his gang came back to the store on October 12, 1937. Many FBI agents were waiting in ambush, inside the store and across the street. One of the gang was caught by an FBI agent in the store. Brady and the other one drew their weapons in the street. They were shot down in a lot of gunfire.\nBrady was killed by FBI agent Walter Walsh. Walsh was wounded, and recovered. He lived to be the FBI's oldest retired Special Agent.\nPictures of the bodies lying dead in the middle of the downtown street became locally famous. For many years, they could be looked at in Dakin's store. In the pictures, a large crowd of people is shown. It was Columbus Day, so people were already lining the streets to see a parade before the shooting began.\nBurial.\nNo one came to get Brady's body, because he did not have any family. He was buried in a grave without a headstone at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor. In 2007, the grave was finally marked with a stone, with a short funeral."}

Gaylord (January 4, 1921 - August 1, 2014) was an American actress, model, and former Miss Minnesota, whose career was most successful during the 1940s.\nHe is not married thier life.\nEarly Life.\nShe was born Karen Xandra Gaylord on January 4, 1921, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to a working class family. She was the oldest of four children (all girls). Her father worked as an engineer with the Northern Pacific Railway. \nAfter she graduated from North Community High School in 1939, Gaylord wanted to go to college to study music and art. But then a friend of hers saw a notice in a magazine called \"Movie Mirror.\" It said that the movie studios in California were accepting photographs with names and addresses to help them find new actors for movies. Without telling Gaylord, her friend mailed in Gaylord's picture. Not long after, Gaylord got a letter telling her that she had been chosen to come to California for a tryout.\nThe entire Gaylord family decided this would be a good chance for all of them. The whole family moved to California with Karen. \nCareer in entertainment.\nAfter moving to California, Karen began going to all of the major studios in Hollywood, doing screen and wardrobe tests (tryouts to see how she acted and looked on movie screens and in costumes). \nIn 1941, Gaylord was in her first film, \"The Chocolate Soldier\" with Nelson Eddy (though she was not listed in the credits at the end of the movie). Between 1941 and 1949, she acted in about 36 films (see the \"Filmography\" section lower on this page). But she was only listed in the credits for these movies once, for the 1944 film \"Cover Girl\" with Rita Hayworth.\nIn 1942, the Chamber of Commerce of Minneapolis, Minnesota, chose Gaylord as their 1942 'Miss Minnesota.' Not long after this, film producer Samuel Goldwyn chose Karen to become one of his six new Goldwyn Girls. (The Goldwyn Girls were a group of female dancers that included some very famous women.) \nGaylord also became a popular stand-in, and stood in place for leading ladies like Linda Darnell, Barbara Stanwyck, Laraine Day, Evelyn Keyes, Gene Tierney, and Jeanne Crain. (A stand-in plays an actor's role when the actor is not there.)\nTeaching and later life.\nIn 1949, Gaylord left the entertainment industry. She moved to Clearwater, Florida, to begin her lifelong dream of teaching music and art. In 1950, she legally changed her name from Karen Xandra Gaylord to Jane Goerner. \nUp until the 1990s, she gave private music and art lessons out of her home. \nIn the last years of her life, she had some serious health problems. She sold her home and moved to Ocala, Florida, to live with her sister and brother-in-law. She died in her sleep at the age of 93 on August 1, 2014. There were no funeral services or memorials. Her body was donated to medical science through the body donation program at the University of Florida's College of Medicine."}

He was one of the most popular French riders. He won the King of the Mountains competition of the Tour de France seven times, which is more than any other cyclist. Virenque finished third in the Tour de France in 1996 and second in 1997.\nHe was part of a famous doping scandal in 1998.\nEarly career.\nHe rode for the V\u00e9lo Club Hy\u00e8rois from the age of 13. He said he knew he could climb well from the start.\nHis first win was in a race round the town at La Valette-du-Var. He and another rider, Pascale Ranucci, lapped everyone else. He then did his national service in the army battalion at Joinville in Paris.\nIn 1990 he came eighth in the world championship road race at Utsunomiya, Tochigi in Japan. He was then offered a professional contract with the team RMO.\nProfessional career.\nHe turned professional for RMO in January 1991.\nVirenque rode his first Tour de France in 1992 as a replacement for Jean-Philippe Dojwa. On the third day he took the maillot jaune of leadership and held it for a day, losing it to his team-mate Pascal Lino, who led for the next two weeks. Virenque finished second in the polka dot jersey climbers' competition.\nAfter the Tour de France Virenque joined another French team, Festina. He stayed there until the team closed down after a doping scandal in 1998.\nVirenque first wore the yellow jersey of the Tour de France in 1992 and for the last time in 2003. In 2003 he wore the jersey on the climb of Alpe d'Huez.\nVirenque was good at climbing but not at time trials.\nFestina affair.\nIn 1998 the Festina cycling team was disgraced by a doping scandal, known as the \"Festina affair\".\nVirenque's teammates, Christophe Moreau, Laurent Brochard and Armin Meier, admitted taking EPO after being arrested during the Tour and were disqualified. Virenque said he was innocent.\nVirenque changed teams to Team Polti in January 1999. He rode the Giro d'Italia in 1999 and won a stage.\nA few weeks later Virenque's name emerged in an inquiry into Bernard Sainz. Sainz was later jailed for practising as an unqualified doctor. Franco Polti, the head of Virenque's team, fined him 30 million lire.\nRace director Jean-Marie Leblanc banned Virenque from the 1999 Tour de France. He was made to let Virenque race by the Union Cycliste Internationale. Leblanc said he hoped Virenque would not win. Virenque rode on a bicycle painted white with red dots to resemble the polkadot jersey of best climber, but he didn't win the competition. He had a bodyguard, Gilles Pagliuca.\nIn 1999 he wrote a book called \"Ma V\u00e9rit\u00e9\". In the book he said he was innocent of doping. He wrote that his team-mates confessed to using EPO because of pressure from the police. He said Moreau's urine showed EPO had not been detected.\nThe Festina affair led to a trial in October 2000. Virenque was a witness as well as others from the Festina team. He at first denied he had doped himself but then confessed. But he denied doping himself intentionally.\nVirenque was criticised by the media and satirists for denying doping even though there was evidence. He was also criticised for pretending he had been doped without his knowledge.\nVirenque lived near Geneva in Switzerland and the Swiss cycling association suspended him for nine months. The sentence was reduced by an independent tribunal to six and a half months. He was fined the equivalent of 2,600 euros and told to pay 1,300 euros in costs. He became depressed.\nPost-suspension career.\nIt was difficult for Virenque to find a team after he returned from his suspension.\nOn 5 July 2001 he joined Domo-Farm Frites. He had help from Eddy Merckx who paid the extra money after the main sponsors wouldn't pay. Domo kept him the following season. On 25 October 2002 he signed for another two years.\nVirenque returned to fame by winning Paris\u2013Tours on 7 October 2001. This was unusual because Paris\u2013Tours is a flat race and sprinters usually win, not climbers. The French magazine, \"V\u00e9lo\", called the victory \"extraordinary.\" \"L'\u00c9quipe\" 's headline on the front page was \"Unbelievable!\"\nVirenque was beaten by Laurent Jalabert in the 2001 and 2002 Tour de France King of the Mountains competition. He won his sixth polka dot jersey in 2003. In 2004 he won the polka dot jersey for the seventh time. This is the most of any cyclist.\nRetirement.\nVirenque rode the Olympic Games road race in Athens. He announced his retirement on 24 September 2004.\nHe won \"Je suis une c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9, sortez-moi de l\u00e0!\" (the French version of \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\") in Brazil in April 2006. In autumn 2005 he opened Virenque Design, a company to design and sell jewellery. Since 2005 he has been a commentator for Eurosport. He has also advertised an energy drink and a pharmacy company.\nPersonal life.\nIn December 2007, Virenque and his wife, St\u00e9phanie, divorced. They had been together for 17 years. They have two children, Clara and Dario.\nVirenque lives at Carqueiranne in the Var region of France. He likes dancing, wine, gardening and flowers. \"Put me in a good garden nursery and I'm in heaven,\" he says.\nPalmar\u00e8s.\nGrand Tour General Classification results timeline.\nDQ = disqualified"}

In odd-numbered years, the men's side of the draw is held in Montreal and the women's are held in Toronto, and in even years they switch cities.\nHistory.\nThe men's tournament started in 1881. It was first held at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club. The women's side of the tournament started later, in 1892. There are only two leading tournaments that started before the Canadian Open, the Wimbledon and the US Open.\nBefore 1968, the tournament was known as the Canadian National Championships. Since the start of the open era, the tournament has had many sponsors. In the 1970s, it was held under the Rothmans International tobacco brand, Player's Limited was the main sponsor in the 1980s, and the sponsor changed again in 1997 to the cigarette company Du Maurier. Since federal measures came into place to restrict tobacco advertising, Rogers, a media company, has become the head sponsor.\nCanadian success.\nNo male Canadian tennis player has won the men's singles tournament since 1958. However, in 2013 Milos Raonic was the first Canadian player to reach the final since the start of the open era, after he beat fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil in the semifinals.\nFaye Urban was the last woman to reach the women's singles final, after her win in 1969.

He was a humanist and romantic in his approach.\nHe founded several schools in German and French-speaking regions of Switzerland, and wrote explaining his principles of education. His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\". \nIn 1780 Pestalozzi published anonymously a series of aphorisms, entitled \"The Evening Hours of a Hermit\". They are his earliest works which outline ideas that would later be known as Pestalozzian. \nHe drew from these experiences and published four volumes of a story titled \"Leonard and Gertrude\". These four volumes are about the lives of four characters: Gertrude, Gl\u00fcphi, an unnamed parish clergyman and Arner. Gertrude is a wife and mother who teaches her children how to live moral upstanding lives. Gl\u00fcphi, a school teacher, sees the success Gertrude has with her children and tries to model his school around her teachings. A parish clergyman also adopts Gertrude's teachings. The work of Gertrude, Gl\u00fcphi and the clergyman are helped by Arner, a politician, who gets help from the state. Through these four, harmony is achieved and a comprehensive education is offered to all people.\nHis next endeavor, \"Enquiries into the course of nature in the development of the human race\", was not so popular. His education was built on the idea that all understanding can be achieved through a psychologically ordered sequence of learning.\nPestalozzi's method was used by the cantonal school in Aarau that Albert Einstein attended.

Tree-dwelling (arboreal) species are slim, delicate and have a long tail. Ground-dwelling species are heavier, and their tail may be small or nonexistent. All species have well-developed thumbs. \nLike many Old World monkeys, they have pads on their bottoms. These are called \"ischial callosities\". They let the monkeys sleep sitting upright on thin branches, beyond reach of predators, without falling off. In some species, these pads change their colour during the mating period.\nThese monkeys are active in the daytime, and live together in social groups. They live in all types of terrain and climate, from cool mountains to rain forests, savannah, bald rocky areas or even snowy mountains, as does the Japanese macaque.\nMost species are omnivorous, with diets ranging from fruits, leaves, seeds, buds, and mushrooms to insects and spiders to smaller vertebrates. All species have cheek pouches in which they can store food. \nGestation lasts approximately six to seven months. Young are weaned after three to 12 months and are fully mature within three to five years. The life expectancy of some species can be as long as 50 years."}

If the workstation was the recipient of the message, it sends a new empty token, otherwise it passes the token along.

It stars Robin Williams as Peter Banning / Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, and Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee. It acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel \"Peter and Wendy\" focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic lawyer with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to Neverland to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.\nSpielberg began developing the movie in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 silent movie and 1953 animated Disney movie. It entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. Hart developed the script with director Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.\nReleased on December 11, 1991, \"Hook\" received mixed reviews, who praised the performances (particularly those of Williams and Hoffman), John Williams' musical score, and production values, but criticized the screenplay and tone. Although it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Spielberg also later came to be disappointed with the movie. It has gained a strong cult following since its release. It was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. It also spawned merchandise, including video games, action figures, and comic book adaptations."}

It is a way of creating a program or application that is focused around distinct tasks or services. With an SOA model, each piece of the program or application performs a specific task (such as retrieving a piece of data, performing a mathematical operation, etc). The tasks are performed completely independent of each other.\nBenefits.\nEasy to test.\nSince each component of the program works independently, each component can be tested by itself without needing the whole program to be completed first. The program can be built piece by piece with confidence that each piece works.\nEasy to reuse legacy programs.\nOften, a company has already created a program or application to perform a specific task. If that is the case, this legacy program, (program that has already been written) or a piece of this legacy program can be reused without the need to re-code that specific task. Consequently, programs with SOA can be developed faster than traditional programs in some circumstances.\nEasy to manage.\nThe benefit is that unlike in a big combined program, each task is isolated, so it is easy to manage and troubleshoot the program after completion. If there is a problem, a developer can check each service component systematically until the problem is detected. After it is detected, only that small service would need to be fixed as opposed to a much larger section of a combined application"}

Twelve or so party members met with Ryutin and read the document. This was in August 1932. They passed it on to other party members. Stalin thought Ryutin and his friends were trying to have him assassinated. Ryutin was arrested. When Stalin tried to have him executed, he was instead sent to a labor camp for ten years. Every party member who read the document was arrested. In 1933 as many as 800,000 were arrested. In 1934 another 340,000 were sent to camps. This shows that Stalin did not yet have enough power to order Ryutin's execution. But by 1937 things had changed. After a 40-minute trial on 1 January 1937 Ryutin was executed."}

It does not have much hair or fur on its body, but it is not truly hairless. The skin is soft because it has a fine layer of down. It may or may not have whiskers. The skin is the color the fur would be. This cat has all the same coat patterns found on other cats, such as a calico or tabby. The pattern is just seen on the Sphynx skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than cats with fur. This makes them feel warm when touched. They also like to seek sun or warm places because they are naturally cold.\nThe lack of hair can cause health issues with kittens in the first weeks of life because they can get sick with respiratory infections. Good breeders should not let their kittens go to new homes without being at least 14 weeks of age. This is to make sure the kitten is mature enough to cope in a new environment.\nHistory.\nThe Sphynx was not the first hairless domestic cat. Some were seen in other places around the world for at least 90 years.\nThe Sphynx breed began in 1966, in Toronto, when a hairless kitten, named Prune, was born to a black and white shorthair cat, named Elizabeth, in Ontario, Canada. The kitten was mated with its mother, so one more naked kitten was born. Along with a few naked kittens found later, the hairless breed began.\nA natural birth of a Sphynx cat happened on a Minnesota farm. The owners found hairless kittens in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s. Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, named Epidermis and Dermis, were also an important part of developing the breed. More hairless cats were found in Texas, Arkansas, and Minnesota. So, the modern Sphynx breed began with the Canadian cats and the Minnesota cats.\nThe first breeders did not know much about cat genetics and they had some problems. The gene pool was small and many kittens died. Many of the females had seizures.\nBehavior.\nSphynxes are friendly and not shy. They have a lot of energy, intelligence, curiosity, and love for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like breeds of cats. They run and greet their owners at the door and are friendly when meeting strangers.\nCaring for a Sphynx.\nEven though Sphynx cats do not have a coat to be brushed, they do need a bath once a week to wash off oils that get on their skin. They should not be left outside and need to be an indoor cat. First, sunlight can give them a sunburn. Secondly, they cannot keep warm when outside, so some owners dress them in warm clothes in the winter."}

The city is located adjacent to and partially within the Town of Oshkosh.\nHistory.\nIn 1670, a French priest, Jean Claude Allouez, landed his canoe in what is now Menominee park in Oshkosh. He came to hold mass for the Indians. European settlers came to the area as early as 1818 and a trading post was set up. By 1837 the small community became known as 'Athens'. In an election in 1840 the name was changed to honor (or flatter) the Menominee chief Oshkosh (meaning 'claw' or 'brave'). Oshkosh became a city in 1853.\nIn 1847 the first Sawmill began making lumber. Soon other sawmills were operating up and down the Fox river. Oshkosh provided lumber for the railroads. When the Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of Chicago in 1871, Oshkosh sawmills provided much of the lumber used to rebuild the city.\nBy 1870, Oshkosh had become the third-largest city in Wisconsin. It had a population of over 12,000. The \"Oshkosh Daily Northwestern\" newspaper (now the Oshkosh Northwestern) was founded around this time. Oshkosh State Normal School later became the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh).\nOshkosh B'Gosh.\nOshkosh B\u2019Gosh, a clothing manufacturer, started here in 1903. They started out making adult work clothing. But they became famous making children's clothing. Their bib overalls allowed children to dress just like their working fathers. In 2005 the company was purchased by Carter's, Inc., a children's clothing company. Oshkosh B'Gosh is still sold as a separate brand of clothing. The clothing is no longer made in Oshkosh but the corporate headquarters are still there.\nThe EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In.\nThe Experimental Aircraft Association, headquartered in Oshkosh, holds a yearly air show called \"AirVenture Oshkosh\". It is mainly for experimental and recreational aircraft. The event has been held at Oshkosh since 1970. The large number of planes coming and going during the fly-in week makes the Wittman Field air traffic control tower the busiest in the world. The event has become so popular that fans simply call it \"Oshkosh\"."}

One of the colors is always white, with no yellow tone. Other colors can be black, red, blue, and cream. The fur may or may not have tabby stripes. These cats are strong with muscles and are medium-sized. The paws are medium in size and have a round shape.

He means the way fascist, communist and socialist governments try to control every aspect of the economy. \nThe rights and wishes of the individual are important, and the state should not interfere too much. When the state controls too much, that leads to a loss of freedom, an oppressive society, and eventually the tyranny of a dictator. The individual citizen becomes a serf. Hayek argued that fascism and socialism had roots in central economic planning and giving the state power over the individual.\nAfter its publication in 1944, \"The Road to Serfdom\" became a popular account of market libertarianism. It has sold over two million copies.\n\"The Road to Serfdom\" was to be a popular edition of the second volume of Hayek\u2019s \"The Abuse and Decline of Reason\". The title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century French classical liberal Alexis de Tocqueville on the \"road to servitude\".p116 The book was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944, during World War II, and was quite popular. Hayek called it \"that unobtainable book\", due to wartime paper rationing.p128 \nIt was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in September 1944 and became popular. The American magazine \"Reader's Digest\" published an abridged version in April 1945. This got \"The Road to Serfdom\" to a wider group of readers than before. The book had a big impact on twentieth-century conservative and libertarian economic and political thinking. It is often cited today by commentators."}

They have large eyes and a short coat of fur. They do not need much brushing because they do not lose much hair. Their coat has three types of markings. First is their background solid color. It is paler than their pattern, which is spotted like a tabby. Their legs and tail have rings or stripes. Their face and neck also have lines of color. The accepted colors are blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon and fawn.\nBehavior.\nAustralian Mists are okay with being picked up and held. They do not scratch much. When they are kittens, they have a lot of energy. As adults, they settle down to be quiet cats. They make good indoor cats. Some can be trained to go for walks with a collar and a leash. "}

Its name literally means 'water wolf'. The Northern pike is a freshwater game fish and the second largest member of the Esox (Pike) family. It is also that family's namesake. In North America they are native to Alaska, Canada and the Upper Midwestern United States. Their natural range also includes Northern Europe and Asia. They are a cold water fish and do best in deep lakes. Northerns are voracious feeders that require large supplies of fish for steady growth. If they are overpopulated in a body of water their growth rate is often stunted.\nPhysical description.\nNorthern pike and Muskellunge look very similar and are sometimes confused. The Northern has light colored markings on a dark body (the opposite of the Musky). Also the Northern has a rounded tail fins while the Musky's are pointed. The northern has a long body. It has a large number of very sharp teeth. The northern is the only member of the pike family with spots on its side that are lighter than the body color. Another difference is they have five or less pores under the jaw; muskies have six or more.\nHabitat and forage.\nNorthern pike are frequently found in very shallow water. They prefer weeds and are often found near fallen logs. In the early spring Northerns move to very shallow water. They often spawn in weedy marshes. As the weather warms up, Northerns move to deeper water close to the edges of weed beds. \nNortherns eat other fish: they eat a lot of other fish. They control other fish species from becoming overpopulated. They feed on whatever is easiest to catch. They wait in ambush and can rush forward with tremendous speed."}

It was caused when the damaged wall of a utility tunnel beneath the Chicago River opened into a breach which flooded basements and underground facilities throughout the Chicago Loop with an estimated of water. No one was killed or hurt during the incident. It caused an estimated $1.95 billion of damage.\nThe tunnels.\nIn 1906 a small tunnel system opened under the downtown. The streets were crowded with horse-wagons. The tunnels were meant to carry things inside with no horses. Coal and \"ashes\" (burnt coal) were always part of the business. Most tunnels were wide and tall. The walls were made of concrete about thick. The tracks were \"gauge\" (the distance between the rails) and an electric \"trolley\" wire was mounted on the ceiling. Two axle electric motor locomotives used electricity from the trolley wires. They pulled small freight cars.\nThere were up to of tracks under the downtown. They went under most streets in a space about by . The tunnel under Kinzie St. went under the Chicago River.\nThe tunnels were a failure. Not enough buildings connected with them and there wasn't enough business. Then trucks replaces horses and the tunnels had even less business. Most buildings stopped using coal and then there were no ashes. The tunnels lost money until they were closed in 1959. After then the city owned them. They are now used for telephone and other wires.\nThe bridge.\nThe Kinzie St. bridge is one of many drawbridges over the Chicago River (a railroad bridge next to it is left open). When it was built in 1909 it opened many times a day. It has a control tower where a bridge-tender could see both ends of the bridge when raising and lowering it. Now it does not open very often and nobody works there. \"Pilings\" (logs pounded into the ground) were bumpers to stop boats from hitting the bridge.\nWhen the pilings were being changed one of the new pilings was moved a little. Nobody thought it was important. The company filled out some paperwork but didn't do anything with them. The city inspectors didn't check the plans or the work. Changing the pilings seemed simple so nobody was careful.\nWhen the new pilings were put in they pushed an older pile into the tunnel. The concrete cracked and a little mud started leaking into the tunnel. An inspector for a cable TV company saw the leak and took pictures. He told the city. Nobody thought it was very important and work was slow.\nThe flood.\nIn the morning of April 13 the tunnel wall broke and water started coming in. The tunnels are below river level and filled up with water. Twenty four older buildings connected to the tunnels. Their basements started to flood. Most had doors closed and locked but the doors were not waterproof. The City Hall/County Building had to move legal paperwork out of the basements. Other buildings also saved things. The tunnels connected to two subways that were closed. Some places not connected to the tunnels also flooded. A low part of an Interstate Highway also flooded. All electricity was turned off and the downtown was closed.\nA whirlpool was seen by the pilings on the southeast corner of the Kinzie St. bridge (that was where the bridge-tender's tower was). A large construction company started to put gravel and sandbags into the hole (the hole was the size of a car). Later quick-drying concrete plugged it. Concrete walls were built in the tunnel on both sides of the river. On April 19, six days after the flood started, the leak was stopped. Two days later the water started to be pumped out. It was pumped out slowly so no other problems happened. On May 21 the pumping was done.\nAfter the flood.\nAfter the flood the tunnels were cleaned out and fixed up. The tunnels were still strong, they were just wet and dirty. Before the flood the city was getting ten million dollars a year in rent from wire companies. Mud (and old train cars left behind) was taken out. Waterproof doors and walls were built and more \"sump-pumps\" put in. Now the tunnels are clean, painted, and still used."}

It is in the Scottish Highlands. It is best known for having been the home of two famous people. First was the writer and occultist Aleister Crowley. Then later, it was the home of Jimmy Page, the guitarist for Led Zeppelin.\nThe house was mostly burned down by fire in December 2015. Boleskine House is a Category B listed building in the United Kingdom, along with the stables and a small lodge (cottage). This means it has historical and cultural importance.\nHistory.\nBoleskine House is 21 miles south of Inverness and close to the village of Foyers. The house was built in the 18th century as a hunting cottage or lodge. The house is right next to a graveyard. The graveyard was already thought to have ghosts and supernatural happenings, even before Crowley bought it.\nAleister Crowley.\nCrowley bought Boleskine House from the Archibald Fraser family in 1899. There were rumors of him using black magic and rituals while he lived at the house. His housekeeper had bad things happen while living there, including the death of his two children. Crowley later said that he had used too much black magic. He sold the house in 1913, because he was running out of money.\nJimmy Page.\nPage was already collecting things about Aleister Crowley. He was reading about him and was interested in his ideas. He bought the house and land in 1970. He thought it would be a good spooky place to help him write songs. At the time it was in bad shape and needed repairs. But, even though he had the house fixed up; he did not spend much time there. Page sold the house in 1992. He actually lived there for less than six weeks.\nA fantasy scene for Page that was shown in Led Zeppelin's movie \"The Song Remains the Same\" was made around Boleskin House. It was made during a full moon in December, 1973. Page is climbing a mountain in the moonlight.\nLater history.\nAfter Page sold it, the house was run as a guest-house. In 2009, the house and land were put up for sale. The sale also included 140 feet of shoreline of Loch Ness. The new Dutch owners, who are not known, were using it as a holiday home. It is now owned by the Boleskine House Foundation and will open to the public after it has been restored.\nFire.\nOn the afternoon of 23 December 2015, a motorist passing by saw flames and smoke coming from Boleskine House. By the time fire crews arrived, almost 60 percent of the home was already burned. Flames were rising up to 20 feet high. The firefighters tried to save the west wing of the house, as the rest of the building had been too badly damaged. The fire was thought to have started in the kitchen, but no one was home.\nIt is not known how much of Boleskine House is still standing since the fire. A former owner said that the damage is so bad it \"is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult wanting to spend a lot of money.\""}

They may think of their family as their herd to take care of. The Komondors are and must be at least high. But they can be much bigger; this is the minimum height. They live 12\u201314 years; which is a long life for a big dog.\nBehavior.\nKomondors are calm, intelligent and independent. They do not always need a human to tell them what to do. This trait can make them more difficult to train. They are loyal and will often follow family members around the house. A Komondor is a large dog. To protect a herd or family is instinctive to this breed. Komondors can be aggressive with people they meet, if they do not learn how to be friendly and social with people and other pets. This ability to be friendly must be taught while they are puppies. Komondors are generally quiet dogs. They do not bark without a good reason. Giving a glaring stare can be a warning to intruders to leave, or the Komondor will attack.\nKomondor dogs should be trained to listen to owners and caregivers. Otherwise they will just go on doing things their own way. This is because that is what they learned to do for hundreds of years. The Komondors were often left alone to take care of the herd. The Komondors learned to make decisions and not wait for directions to tell them what to do if a wolf or bear was coming.\nKomondors as pets.\nThe Komondor is usually silent and sleeping during the day. But when the night comes the Komondor starts moving around. The Komondor will walk up and down all over the area he is supposed to guard. The dog will take care of any thief, burglar or bad people who want to make trouble. The Komondor often knows how to tell a friendly person from a burglar. The Komondor just knows and feels if somebody will come with a bad intention."}

In legends, it is said that St. Helen brought hundreds of cats to get rid of poisonous snakes that were taking over the monastery. The monastery had two bells. One rang to call the cats for their food. The second one rang to send the cats out to the meadows to hunt snakes. Now, the monastery has very few cats that live there.\nBehavior.\nCyprus cats are strong, athletic and full of energy. They live both in the cool mountains and in hotter areas near the sea coasts. They can adapt to any climate or living space."}

They curl back away from the face and seem to be sideways. This cat is a rare breed, but now lives in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and other parts of the world. The American Curl is usually a strong and healthy breed.\nBoth longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners.\nAppearance.\nThe American Curl is a medium-sized cat (5\u201310\u00a0lbs). It is not completely grown until 2\u20133 years of age. American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, like any other kittens. The ears begin to curl in about eighty-two days. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer. Then they become hard and feel stiff.\nA house pet American Curl may have almost straight ears. To qualify for cat shows, ears must curl at an angle between 90 and 180 degrees. More curl is better, but cats will be not allowed to be shown if their ears touch the back of their skulls.\nHistory.\nThe breed began in Lakewood, California in a natural birth of kittens, but with a genetic mutation. In June 1981, two stray kittens were found and taken in by the Ruga family. The kittens were both longhaired, one black and the other black and white. The family named the black cat Shulamith. The black and white was named Panda. Several weeks later, Panda went missing. This left Shulamith to be the first female of the American Curl breed.\nIn 1986, an American Curl was judged in a cat show for the first time. In 1992, a longhaired American Curl became a champion in The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl was the first breed the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship Class allowed in both longhair and shorthair categories.\nHealth.\nAmerican Curl cats' ears need cleaning often to keep away infections. The ears must also be handled very gently to keep from breaking the cartilage."}

It was brought to Hungary with the Magyars in the late 9th century. They are used as herding and guard dogs.\nFemale Pulis are about high. Males are . Females weigh . Males weigh a little more.\nBehavior.\nThe Puli is an intelligent and active dog. It needs obedience training while still young. If a Puli gets enough exercise it can live in the city, even in an apartment. \nBut Pulis do best when not kept as indoor pets in a small living space. Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their energy, or they can became either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for. A Puli without enough exercise can became mischievous and cause trouble. The right kind of exercise includes running, biking, hiking, jogging and field work; not just a walk around the corner. Pulis are best kept in a house with a garden.\nThe Puli is happiest when it has work to do. Then this dog will show excellent intelligence, strength and ability to work with humans. This satisfies their strong instinct to guard their herd.\nAs a working dog, the Puli is obedient and focused when doing a task. Some of them are used as police dogs. They are one of the best sheepdogs. Pulis don't need to be taught how to guard the sheep. They naturally protect their territory and flock. Even though they are not big dogs, they will still try to scare away anyone they do not know.\nIf well trained, they understand even the smallest instructions and obey. They are excellent in obedience trials for dogs. These are also dogs who are sensitive (get their feelings hurt easily). Pulis hate being bullied or made fun of. Because they are so intelligent, they understand that they are being mistreated. If not treated well, they lose their desire to cooperate.\nPulis are not very friendly with people they do not know. With owners and friends, these dogs are funny, lovely and playful. Pulis bark quite a lot.\nFur.\nThe coat of fur on a Puli is corded, like dreadlocks. The puli is a one-colored dog. It is usually black. It can also be white, gray, or cream. All Pulis, even the white ones have black eyes, black noses and black feet. The Puli's coat needs a lot of care to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. About 45 minutes of grooming work each week is recommended. When the dog is older the cords can become quite long and heavy. They sometimes are so long that they touch the ground. The cords can be thinner or thicker cords. The thin, nice cords are made by keeping the fur clean and cared for. Thin ropes are made by hand forming thinner ropes. \nThis breed has little to no shedding (see Moult)."}

Also, there are some differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy and intelligent working breed. Because of having been bred to meet show dog qualities, it is no longer an ideal working dog. These Spaniels now have many health problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.\nThe American Cocker has a medium long silky coat of fur. It has an upturned nose, either black or brown. It has long, silky ears that hang down. The eyes are large, dark in color and round. Fur colors can be black, tan, cream, dark red, buff, roan and sometimes merle.\nBehavior.\nThis dog breed is nicknamed the \"Merry Cocker\". It is a friendly dog and not shy.\nIt is smart as a hunting dog. IQ tests given in the 1950s and 1960s showed the American Cocker did best of all dogs tested on hunting skills. But, they did not do as well on other skills. These showed they were slower in uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string. The American Cocker Spaniel is in 20th place in Stanley Coren's \"The Intelligence of Dogs\". This means this dog is excellent in \"Working or Obedience Intelligence\" and in being trained.\nIf they are played with and loved as puppies, American Cockers can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed has a tail that wags most of the time. It likes best to be around people. It is not meant to be left alone in a backyard. Cockers can get stressed by loud noises and by being treated roughly or fussed at.\nBecause they have now been bred to have a long coat, they can no longer be active enough to hunt or be exercised outside."}

The vision was of The Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, John the Evangelist, angels, and Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. A church was later built on the site, to worship and remember this event.\nThe vision.\nOn the evening of 21 August 1879, at about 8 o'clock, fifteen people, aged from five years to seventy-five included men, women, teenagers and children, witnessed this event.\nThey all said they saw an apparition of Our Lady, Saint Joseph, and Saint John the Evangelist on the wall of the small parish church. The little church was called the Church of Saint John the Baptist.\nDescription.\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary was said to be beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white dress. She had a crown on her head. The crown was golden, sparkling, and glittering. She was described as \"in prayer\", with her eyes raised to heaven.\nSaint Joseph, also wearing a white robe, stood on the Virgin's right hand. Behind the figures, to the left of Saint John was a plain altar. On the altar was a cross and a lamb, with angels around. The lamb is the symbol of Jesus. This symbol is from the religious phrase The Lamb of God)\nThose who saw the apparition stood in the rain for up to two hours.\nEvidence.\nAn ecclesiastical inquiry was held to decide if the vision was true and not a mistake or fake.\nThe evidence was found to be trustworthy and not a lie. At a second Commission of inquiry in 1936, the surviving witnesses confirmed the evidence they gave to the first Commission.\nEvery August, ten thousand pilgrims go to visit the Knock Shrine .\nThe original little church is still there. A new Apparition chapel with statues of Our Lady, St Joseph, the lamb and St John the Evangelist, has been built next to it. Knock Basilica is a separate building showing a tapestry of the apparition.\nRecent history.\nMother Teresa of Calcutta visited the Shrine in June 1993."}

Prime numbers are not distributed evenly across the number range. The theorem formalizes the idea that the probability of hitting a prime number between 1 and a given number becomes smaller, as numbers grow. This probability is about n/ln(n), where ln(n) is the natural logarithm function. This means that the probability of hitting a prime number with 2n digits is about half as likely than with n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (ln\u00a0101000 \u2248 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (ln\u00a0102000 \u2248 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first \"N\" integers is roughly ln(\"N\").\nFifteen-year old Carl Friedrich Gauss suspected that there was a link between prime numbers and logarithms in 1793. Adrien-Marie Legendre also suspected such a link in 1798. Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jean de La Vall\u00e9e Poussin proved the prime number theorem in 1896, over a century after Gauss."}

This righting reflex starts to happen at 3\u20134 weeks of age. The cat has entirely learned how to do this by 6\u20137 weeks. Cats are able to do this because they have a flexible backbone and a clavicle that does not move. The minimum height needed for this to happen safely in most cats is about 12 inches.\nCats without a tail can also do this. This is because a cat mostly moves its hind legs and does not use much angular momentum to set itself up for landing. So a tail is not really needed for this skill.\nUsing this righting reflex, cats can often land without injury. But, this is not always true, since cats can still break bones or die from extreme falls. \nIn a 1987 study, written in the \"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association\", 132 cats were looked at after having fallen from buildings. The injuries per cat were more, depending on the height fallen; up to seven stories high. Above seven stories, the injuries were less. The study authors think that after falling five stories, the cats reached terminal velocity. At that time, the cats relaxed and spread their bodies to increase drag.\nHow the cat does it.\nFirst, cats decide which is up or down, by looking to see or by using senses in the inner ear. Then, cats manage to twist themselves to face downward, without ever changing their angular momentum. They do this in these steps:\nIf the cat is not flexible enough (able to bend easily), it may need to do steps two and three again in order to completely right itself.\nTerminal velocity.\nBesides this righting reflex, cats have body features that help keep them safe in a fall. Their small size, light bones, and thick fur decrease their terminal velocity. Also, once righted they may also spread out their body to increase drag and slow how fast they are falling. They also relax as they fall, which protects them some when they land."}

This is named the cat righting reflex. This reflex lets them land on their feet if dropped from high enough up (about ). Toast, not being alive, does not have the ability to turn itself over. Nor does it want to, since it cannot think.\nToast usually lands on the floor butter-side-down. This is because of how it is dropped from a table. As the toast falls from the table, it rotates or turns. Using the average speed of rotation for a slice of toast as it falls from the table and the usual height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor 81% of the time. This is because the buttered side is heavier. When an object has a heavy and light side, in most cases it will fall heavy side first.\nDomestic cats usually weigh between . A regular slice of bread weighs only one ounce and a pat of butter about one fourth ounce. So attaching a very small piece of toast with butter to a much larger cat would hardly have any effect on how the cat would move."}

Following the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, France became a republic. He spent 21 years in exile before being made king after the abdication of Charles X of France in 1830. His relatively short reign (1830\u20131848) was known as the July Monarchy. Louis-Philippe promoted friendship with Great Britain. He sponsored colonialism, notably the conquest of Algeria. His popularity faded quickly when French troops fired on demonstrators. This set off the French Revolution of 1848 causing Louis Philippe to flee to England as \"Mr. Smith\". He lived out his life in exile in England. His eldest son and heir died before succeeding him. This brought the Kingdom of the French to an end.\nEarly life.\nBorn at the Palais Royal in Paris he was named Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Louis Philippe in honour of his father. His parents were the Duke and Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans. One of the most senior members of the French royal court. He was born a Prince of the blood which entitled him to be addressed as \"His Serene Highness\". From birth he was given the title of Duke of Valois one of his fathers subsidiary titles. He was the eldest of four children born to the duke and duchess. He was a member of the House of Orl\u00e9ans, itself a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon. The two branches were both directly descended from Louis XIV and were often in competition with one another. \nHis education was carried out by Madame de Genlis who was later his fathers mistress. It was her that instilled a fairly liberal attitude within the young prince. When Louis Philippe's grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and Louis Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.\nHis parents had a strained marriage the Duke was famous for his many extramarital affairs and his wife just quietly accepted his infidelity. She was a notoriously religious woman who relished watching her children grow up. Louis Philippe was the eldest of four children born to the couple. Louis Philippe was very close to his brother, the younger Duke of Montpensier. \nIn 1792 he joined the French army and went to fight in Austria. But in April 1793 he deserted. He could not return to France so he found work as a teacher in Switzerland. He then went to live in Sweden. After that he lived in the United States and finally he moved to England.\nAfter the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Louis Philippe returned to France. King Louis XVIII gave him back his Orl\u00e9ans estates.\nMarriage.\nIn 1808, proposed to Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George III of the United Kingdom. His Catholicism and the opposition of her mother Queen Charlotte meant the princess reluctantly declined the offer.\nIn 1809, Louis Philippe married Princess Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Maria Carolina of Austria. They had ten children. Maria Amalia was also a niece of the late Queen Marie Antoinette.\nHe died on August 26, 1850 in Claremont, Surrey, England.\nLegacy.\nWhen king of the French he made his children and descendants legally able to bare the title of Prince/ss of Orl\u00e9ans. With the style of \"Royal Highness\". \nReferences.\n "}

The company was founded in 1898 and incorporated in 1901. The cars made by the company were called Stanley Steamers. They were produced from 1896 to 1924. In the early 1900s steam was used to power locomotives, steamships, even sewing machines. It seemed natural that steam could power cars. Of all the steam driven cars made in the early 20th century, the Stanley Steamer was the best-known and most popular. Today Stanley Steamers are rare automobiles and hard to find outside of museums and a few car collections.\nEarly history.\nTwins Francis E. Stanley and Freelan O. Stanley were the co-inventors of the Stanley Steamer automobile. Freelan was a teacher and high school principal. Francis was also a teacher, but left teaching in 1874 to become a photographer. In 1885 they both left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The brothers had become interested in making cars and wanted to do that full time.\nBuilding steam cars.\nMany inventors were working on making cars during this time. The Stanley brothers built their first two cars as a hobby. In 1898 they brought their cars to the first Auto show in the US held in Boston. Cars from the US and Europe were on exhibition. There was also an outdoor competition. Their Stanley Steamers were faster and could climb hills much better than other cars. No gasoline engined car could climb the 15% grade. A Whitney steam car nearly climbed the 20% grade. The Stanley steamer easily climbed the 30% grade.\nWith the money from the sale of their company to Eastman Kodak, they began making steam cars. In 1899, they produced and sold over 200 cars, more than any other U.S. maker. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road; the descent was accomplished by putting the engine in low gear and using the car's brakes. The twins later sold the rights to this early design to Locomobile, and in 1902 they formed the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.\nStanley licensed their designs to several other motor car companies. The White Motor Company was one who used the Stanley design and continued to produce steam cars until 1912. Stanley was the last manufacturer of steam powered cars. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. The numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. Francis Stanley died in an automobile accident later the same year (1918). His brother Freelan opened a hotel in Colorado called The Stanley Hotel. He lived to be 91 years old. Stanley Steamers were made until 1924.\nDesign and operation.\nEarly Stanley cars had bodies made of wood. The bodies were attached to steel frames by leaf springs. Later bodies were made of aluminum. A Kerosene burner heated a drum-shaped boiler. The boiler stored steam. The driver controlled the steam going to the engine by a throttle. There was no need for a transmission. Starting a Stanley in the morning would wake everyone who lived nearby. It sounded like a steam locomotive, hissing and chugging. It was very hard to steal a Stanley Steamer. It took 20 minutes to gather enough steam before it could move. Once it was moving it seemed to have unlimited power. An early Stanley Steamer was capable of 75 miles per hour. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour in Florida. To operate a Stanley Steamer, the driver had to watch a number of gauges. There were 13 handles, pumps and valves to adjust. They carried only a small amount of water due to its weight. The car could only go about 40 miles before it had to add water. The kerosene burner was known to cause fires. The easier to operate gasoline powered internal combustion engine caused the steam car to become obsolete."}

It is then mixed with songs, commercials and other elements to make it sound like a live air shift. Voice-tracking is mostly used in radio stations, especially during the night, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. Most radio stations also use it as a way to save money instead of having disc jockeys around the clock.\nVariations.\nSometimes, voice-tracking is done so that people can do other jobs. For example, a DJ may also have a job as a program director or general manager. Voice-tracking allows that person to record a three-hour shift in less than a half-hour, leaving him or her time to do office work. A popular live weekday morning radio host can record parts for a Saturday show, allowing him or her to be on the air six days a week without spending more time at the station. It is also helpful during holidays such as Christmas or Easter, when people are off spending time with their families.\nFormatics.\nDifferent radio stations want their DJs to speak only at certain times. Here is an example:\nAs an example, see the picture below:&lt;br&gt;\nAs one song ends, the next song begins. At this point, the DJ doesn't start talking until the second song starts and he stops at the point where the song's vocals start."}

It was created by John D. Beck and Ron Hart. It originally aired on Disney Channel from July 19, 2013 to March 24, 2017. The show stars Dove Cameron in a dual role as identical twin sisters. They have completely different personalities and are best friends. Liv is an actress. She has come back to her home after living in Hollywood for four years. She was the star of a popular television show called \"Sing It Loud!\". Maddie is a basketball prodigy. The show is about Liv having to get used to normal family life again after production on \"Sing It Loud!\" ended. It is also about the two sisters being best friends despite their different personalities and different interests. The show also stars Joey Bragg, Tenzing Norgay Trainor, Kali Rocha, and Benjamin King. The characters they play are Joey Rooney, Parker Rooney, Karen Rooney, and Pete Rooney. Joey and Parker are Liv and Maddie's younger brothers. Karen and Pete are their mother and father. In the last season of the show, Lauren Lindsey Donzis joined the cast. She played Liv and Maddie's younger cousin Ruby. Ruby becomes their \"sorta-sister\". Her character replaced Pete. Pete was not in any of the episodes of the fourth season.\nPlot.\nAfter finishing a four-year stint in Hollywood filming a popular television show called \"Sing It Loud!\", actress Liv Rooney returns to her birthplace of Stevens Point, Wisconsin to the open arms of her family, despite being offered more roles in other shows and movies. Liv decided to come home because she missed her family and wanted to see them again. She is happily reunited with her identical twin sister Maddie. Maddie is her best friend. Liv is a girly girl. She enjoys anytime someone mentions her former career. Maddie is a tomboy with a talent for basketball. She is the captain of her school's basketball team. The twins have two younger brothers. They are Joey and Parker. Joey is a typical awkward teen. He is one year younger than the twins. Parker is a clever tween. He has a mischievous personality. Parker is the youngest child of the Rooney family. Their father Pete is the coach for Maddie's basketball team. He eventually achieves his dream of becoming the coach of a college team in Beloit, Wisconsin. Their mother Karen is the school psychologist and later vice principal starting in the second season.\nIn the first three seasons, most events take place at either Ridgewood High, the high school that Liv, Maddie, Joey, and later Parker, due to being a child prodigy, all attend, or the Rooney residence. At the end of the third season, the Rooney house collapses due to a series of tunnels created by Parker and Maddie is accepted into a college in Los Angeles, California. This prompts the rest of the Rooneys, except Pete who remains in Wisconsin to continue his coaching job, to move to Malibu, California, to take up residence with Karen's younger sister Dena and her daughter Ruby, where the show's forth season takes place. In the last episode of the series, all the Rooneys part ways. Liv is invited to perform in a musical called \"Double Duchess\" on Broadway, Maddie is given a grant to build tiny houses for the homeless in New Orleans, Joey is invited to go on a comedy tour with Jim Breuer, and Parker is invited to go with his friend Val to a biodome in the salt flats of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia to study life on Mars.\nA big part of the show are documentary-style cutaways where major characters and the supporting characters talk to the viewers to explain various things and their opinions on the situations in which they are featured in each episode. In the last episode, it is revealed that the cutaways are part of a reality series that airs in Luxembourg called \"Bits and Pieces\". This is a reference to the working title of \"Liv and Maddie\".\nSeries overview.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt; &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn the spring of 2012, Oops Doughnuts Productions had shopped the script of a project called \"Bits and Pieces\". It was about a blended family similar to shows like \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"Step by Step\". The show followed Jodie Sullenger (Kali Rocha), mother of Alanna (Dove Cameron) and Sticky (Joey Bragg). Sullenger married Pete Fickman (Benjamin King), father of Crystal (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and Brody (Tenzing Norgay Trainor). All six have to get used to life under the same roof. Eventually, Disney chose to change the concept of \"Bits and Pieces\" into one about a pair of twins. Now titled \"Liv and Maddie\", the show began production in April 2013.\nThe show was produced under a joint venture between Beck &amp; Hart Productions, Oops Doughnuts Productions, and It's a Laugh Productions. The show's creators, John D. Beck and Ron Hart, are a production-writing team. Their credits include \"According to Jim\", \"Hey Arnold!\", and \"Shake It Up!\". They also served as executive producers alongside Andy Fickman. Fickman was the only director who participated in all four seasons of the show. He directed 20 of the 21 episodes of the first season. He also directed four episodes of the second season, two of the third season, and four of the fourth season.\nOn January 13, 2014, Disney Channel renewed \"Liv and Maddie\" for a 13-episode second season. The second season was later expanded to 24 episodes. The first season ended on July 27, 2014. The season season premiered on September 21, 2014. On April 3, 2015, the show was renewed for a third season by Disney Channel. The second season ended on August 23, 2015. The third season premiered on September 13, 2015. On December 21, 2015, Dove Cameron stated that Disney Channel was picking up \"Liv and Maddie\" for a fourth season.

The show ended on March 24, 2017.\nCasting.\nCasting took place during the spring of 2012; however, only a pilot episode was made. Instead of hiring a new cast, production chose to keep those whom they had already hired and make a completely new pilot. The story now focused on Dove Cameron playing dual roles with the same parents and brothers. Lead billing for Cozi Zuehlsdorff was later dropped to guest star. The family name of \"Rooney\" was picked because of Sullenger's enjoyment of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team owned by the Rooney family.\nMusic.\nA full version of the \"Liv and Maddie\" theme song, \"Better in Stereo\", was recorded by Dove Cameron. It was released as a promotional single by Walt Disney Records on October 15, 2013. A music video was made. The music video aired on Disney Channel on the night of October 29, 2013. The song was featured twice in the show. The first time was in the last episode of season three, \"Californi-A-Rooney\". The second time was an acoustic version sung by Cameron.

Born in exile in his mother's native Sicily, he was their heir to the House of Orl\u00e9ans from birth. Following his father's succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the \"Prince Royal\" and subsequently Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (French: \"duc d'Orl\u00e9ans\"), the title by which he is best known. Dying in 1842, he never succeeded his father nor saw the collapse of the \"July Monarchy\" and subsequent exile of his family to England.\nInfancy and background.\nHe was named after his two grandfathers King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9. He was born in Palermo and given the title of Duke of Chartres. He was also a prince of the blood at the French royal court of Versailles. This gave him the style of \"Serene Highness\". His father was banned from attending court at Versailles due to his liberal views. Prince did not attend either. He instead remained at his father's court at their Parisian residence the Palais Royal. \nHeir to the throne.\nHis father became King of the French in 1830. This made the prince the heir to the title of Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and heir to the throne. From that time the heir to the French throne was to be known as the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. His father also declared his descendants through the male line were entitled to use the style of \"Royal Highness\". They also used the title (a title in its own right) of Prince of Orl\u00e9ans. The prince became known as His Royal Highness, Prince Ferdinand Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. His sons were also entitled to the same style and title.\nMarriage.\nThere were plans for him to marry his cousin, Louise Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Artois. But the plans never materialised. There were also negotiations for the young prince to marry an Austrian Archduchess as well as a Russian grand duchess. But the plans again never materialised as the new monarchy in France was seen as fragile and not expected to survive. Instead the choice came in the form of Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was a member of a minor ducal family native to Germany. The couple eventually married on 30 May 1837. This gave her the style of Royal Highness and made her one of the first princesses of Orl\u00e9ans by marriage. The couple eventually had two sons and had a very happy marriage."}

It is part of the greater Boston area. The population was 31,915 at the 2010 census. Watertown is one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities that have been granted city forms of government but kept the name town.\nHistory.\nThe area of Watertown was inhabited for thousands of years before the arrival of settlers from England. The tribes of the Pequossette and the Nonantum, had settlements on what is now called the Charles River. The Pequossette built a fishing to trap herring. This was at the site of the current Watertown Dam. Every year the alewife and blueback herring swim upstream from their adult home in the sea. this is to spawn in the fresh water where they came from.\nThe first settlement of Watertown was at the Saltonstall Plantation in 1630. This was one of the earliest of the Massachusetts Bay settlements. It was begun by a group of settlers led by Richard Saltonstall and the Rev. George Phillips. It was officially incorporated that same year. The alternate spelling \"Waterton\" is seen in some early documents.\nThe first buildings were on land that is now in the city of Cambridge. It was known as Gerry's Landing. For its first quarter century Watertown ranked next to Boston in population and area. Since then its city limits have been greatly reduced.\nThe Stanley Brothers built the first of their steam-powered cars, called Stanley Steamers, in Watertown in 1897."}

It was used to break open the stone walls of castles or splinter their wooden gates.\nIn its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log carried by several people and banged against an obstacle. The ram damages the target if the big log hit the target again and again. Later rams were covered in the log with an arrow-proof, fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels. Inside the canopy, the log was swung from chains or ropes.\nRams were great weapons of war against old fashioned wall-building materials such as stone and brick. These walls were weak in tension: they cracked when struck with sufficient force. With many blows, the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created. Eventually, a breach would appear in the fabric of the wall. It would cause armed attackers to force their way through the gap.\nThe introduction in the later Middle Ages of siege cannons causes the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons. Much smaller, hand-held versions of battering rams are still used today, however, by law enforcement officers and military personnel to bash open locked doors."}

He and his twin brother Freelan Oscar Stanley invented and manufactured the Stanley Steamer car. They were pioneers in the use of steam engines to power cars.\nEarly life.\nFrancis E. Stanley and his twin Freelan O. Stanley were born on 1 June 1849 in Kingsfield, Maine. Their parents were Solomon and Apphia (French) Stanley. Solomon Stanley was both a farmer and a teacher. He and his brother graduated from Farmington State Normal School in Farmington, Maine. The school is now the University of Maine at Farmington. Francis became a teacher, and taught at New Portland, Cape Elizabeth and Strong, Maine. In 1870 he met and married Augusta May Walker, another teacher. Together they had three children. In 1875 he left teaching and moved to Auburn, Maine. He became an artist and photographer opening a studio there. He began to do more portrait photography and opened two more studios in Lewiston and Bridgton, Maine. In the early 1880s he started experimenting with the new dry plate way of taking pictures.\nIn 1885 both brothers left their jobs and started a company to make photographic plates for photographers. they sold their shop four years later when they moved to Watertown, Massachusetts. They started another photographic plate business, but sold it to Eastman Kodak in 1904. The photographic plate business had made both brothers very wealthy.\nThe Stanley Steamer.\nIn 1897 the two brothers began experimenting and making steam-powered cars. They were soon making about 200 cars a year. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.\nThe cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.\nLater years.\nAs other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, the Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, his car ran off the road. He was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918. He was 69 years old. His brother Freelan lived to be 91 years old."}

At the start, MIPS was an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. Most of it is done in RISC. In a full RISC architecture, all commands have the same length. This simplifies the design of the microchip and allows to use fast clock cycles. At the start, the architecture used a 32 bit bus, but from 1991, a 64 bit architecture was used.\nIn 2015, MIPS implementations are primarily used in embedded systems such as Windows CE devices, routers, residential gateways, and video game consoles such as the Sony Playstation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Until late 2006, they were also used in many of SGI's computer products. MIPS implementations were also used by Digital Equipment Corporation, NEC, Pyramid Technology, Siemens Nixdorf, Tandem Computers and others during the late 1980s and 1990s. In the mid to late 1990s, it was estimated that one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS implementation."}

In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown and began building their cars. They then sold their car company to John B. Walker and Amzi L. Barber for $250,000 USD. With it they sold the rights to their car designs. The sale had a clause that the two Stanley brothers could not build and sell cars for two years. The Stanley brothers broke the clause and had to give their new design to the company Walker and Barber formed, the Locomobile Company of America. In 1901 Francis and Freelan Stanley formed a new car company, the Stanley Motor Carriage Company.\nThe cars they produced, called Stanley Steamers, had many advantages. The cost was $650. That was $300 less than the cost of a Ford Model T. The cars were very quiet and only made hissing sounds from the boiler. They had no transmission because there was no need to change gears as there was with gasoline-powered cars. Their cars began making news. In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of these cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. In 1906 a Stanley Steamer broke the land speed record at 127 miles per hour on a beach in Florida.\nLater years.\nIn business, the twins looked exactly alike and dressed the same. They even trimmed their beards the same. People they worked with said the only way to tell them apart was each had a different reaction when you told him a joke. As other car companies moved from steam to gasoline power, their Stanley Steamer became the most popular steam powered car. As the internal combustion engine designs improved, however, steam and electric cars lost much of their popularity. Finally, the numbers of cars sold went down to less than 600 a year in 1918. That year the Stanley brothers sold the company to Prescott Warren, a Chicago businessman. both brothers retired. A few months later, while he was driving home from a trip to Maine, Francis' car ran off the road. Francis was driving a new 1918 Model 735 Stanley Steamer. He died in the accident, July 21, 1918.\nIn 1903 Freelan came down with tuberculosis and was given less than a year to live. He and his wife Flora came to Colorado to try to improve his health. The couple fell in love with Estes Park, Colorado. Stanley's health began to improve and in 1906 he began building a large hotel. The site had spectacular views of Rocky Mountain National Park. He opened his hotel in 1909. It had luxuries (for that time) of telephones, electricity and indoor plumbing. He had a fleet of Stanley Steamers to bring guests to his hotel, named The Stanley Hotel. The Stanley Hotel was the inspiration behind Stephen King's book \"The Shining\". King wrote much of the book while he was a guest in room 217. Other famous guests of the hotel include Theodore Roosevelt, Molly Brown and the Emperor of Japan.\nStanley made a number of contributions to Estes Park. He built a hydroelectric plant to provide electricity to the town. He gave land for parks, a fairground and he improved roads in the area. He spent every summer in Estes Park for 37 years. He died on October 2, 1940 at age 91."}

They made their headquarters in Rochester, New York. It began as the Eastman Dry plate company. The company made Photographic plates for Photographers. It changed from a partnership to a corporation in 1884. In 1888 it changed its name again to the Eastman Kodak Company. This is when they released their first hand-held camera called the Kodak. It used a roll of photographic film which the company had started making in 1885. It was a camera simple enough for anyone to take pictures. Eastman Kodak re-invented photography and became an American success story. But their success would not last.\nHistory.\nAt first photographers used glass plates they had to coat with an emulsion. But they had to be used within minutes of being coated. They also had to be processed into a picture right away. In 1878, Eastman successfully created dry plates that could be coated with a gelatin solution. These could be used at the photographer's convenience. They did not require all the heavy equipment wet plates did. Eastman decided to go into business selling them. He invented a machine to mass-produce dry plates. In 1888, the company sold the first Kodak box cameras. The slogan was \"you press the button, we do the rest\". For $24 USD the camera came already loaded with film capable of taking 100 pictures. The camera was sent back to the factory where for $10 the film was developed into pictures. These cameras first used paper film but later turned to Nitrocellulose film. An indexing roller to hold film was invented by David Houston. It had square holes in the edge of the film to advance the film with no waste or Multiple exposures. But Eastman did not want to pay to license his patent. So they bought his patent in 1899. Kodak kept making dry plates until that market dried up. Their main profit was in film and film developing papers and chemicals. They made film for the movie industry, 16mm film for hobby filmmaking and cameras of all kinds. In the mid- 1920s they came out with color film. In 1929 Kodak created motion picture film for adding sound to motion pictures.\nProblems.\nIn 1947 Edwin H. Land invented the Polaroid instant camera. The camera could develop its own pictures inside the camera in 60 seconds. Within five years Polaroid sold over a million cameras. Kodak took notice. Since Kodak held 80% of the market for photographic development, instant cameras were a real threat. Kodak quickly came out with their own instant camera. Land sued Kodak for $12 billion for using its technology. In 1990 Land won and Kodak quit making instant cameras. But they won only a fraction of what they said Kodak's action had cost them, and Land went out of business in 2001. \nFujifilm, the Japanese photography company, began selling inexpensive film in the United States in the 1980s. Since their film cost much less than Kodak's, by 1999 they had a large share of the film market. Kodak lost millions of dollars and had many layoffs. When Digital cameras became popular, Kodak quickly joined that market. By 1999 they were the second largest maker of digital cameras. But they lost $60 on each one they sold. \nKodak made so many marketing mistakes that its stock dropped from $76 a share in 1999 to $25 in 2004. They dropped out of the film manufacturing business. Finally Kodak was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In 2012 the 131-year-company filed for bankruptcy. After selling off many of its products to other companies, Kodak came out of bankruptcy a much smaller company."}

These cats often have a mark that looks like the letter \"M\" on their foreheads. Tabbies are not a cat breed. Tabby cats are very common. About two-thirds of the world's cat population are tabbies.\nThe tabby pattern is in many pure breeds of cats, as well as in mixed breeds. The tabby pattern happens naturally because of cats' closest ancestor, the African Wildcat. It has the same colors and patterns. \nTabby patterns.\nThere are four tabby patterns that are genetically different: mackerel, classic, spotted, and ticked.\nThere is also a fifth pattern that includes tabby as part of another basic color pattern. The \"patched\" tabby is a calico or tortoiseshell cat with tabby patches (also known as \"caliby\" and \"torbie\").\nMackerel is the original pattern and is by far the most common tabby pattern. The legs and tail have dark bars as do the cat's cheeks. A \"mackerel tabby\" has narrow stripes that run in parallel down its sides. This is what some people refer to as a \"tiger.\" An \"M\" shape appears on the forehead along with dark lines across the cat's cheeks to the corners of its eyes. Mackerels are also called 'Fishbone tabbies' probably because of the mackerel fish. A mackerel tabby pattern is the only striped coat pattern seen in domestic cats.\nThe classic tabby cat (also known as \"blotched\" or \"marbled\") has a pattern usually in the colors of dark brown, ochre, and black; but sometimes grey. Classic tabbies have the \"M\" pattern on their foreheads too. The body is marked with a whirled or swirled pattern (often called a \"bullseye\") on the cat's sides. There is also a light colored \"butterfly\" pattern on the shoulders and three thin stripes (the center stripe is dark) running along its spine. Classic tabbies have dark stripes on their legs, tail, and cheeks. Classic tabby is a recessive trait, so these cats are not as common as mackerel tabbies.\nA ticked tabby pattern makes a grizzly color of fur of dark and light bands or bars. These break up the tabby pattern into a \"salt-and-pepper\" look. Some stripes or bars can often be seen on the lower legs, face and belly and sometimes at the end of the cat's tail.\nThe spotted tabby has a gene that breaks up the mackerel tabby pattern so that the stripes appear as spots. Sometimes, the stripes of a classic tabby's pattern may be broken into larger spots. Both large spot and small spot patterns can be seen in the Australian Mist, Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Maine Coon, and Ocicat breeds.\nColors.\nTabbies may be brown, grey, orange, or calico, including dilute versions of these colors. The most common tabby color is brown. All orange cats are tabbies, and the orange portion of calico cats will always show tabby patterns. Since the orange gene is on the X chromosome, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male, and nearly all calico cats are female. Colorpoint cats (Siamese, Himalayan, etc) that are tabbies are referred to as lynx point. As with solid-color cats, tabbies may also be partly white, such as tuxedo or van patterns. The tabby pattern is not visible at all in the white portion.\nHistory.\nThe mackerel tabby pattern was the first tabby pattern in domestic cats. It is believed to have come from the African Wildcat and the European Wildcat. Both of these wild cats have a pale, striped tabby pattern. But when those breeds mixed, it made a more distinct mackerel tabby coat. At first, the mackerel tabby was common in all domestic cats. But later, other tabby patterns happened because of mutations and selective breeding of the mackerel tabby. All domestic cats have the tabby gene. But the genes of some cat breeds hide the tabby appearance. "}

It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871. By 1879 the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemical work done at the factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers. \nHistory.\nThe first practical way to take photographs was called the daguerreotype. It was introduced in 1839. It used sheets of copper coated with silver. The plate was then exposed to chemical fumes, then taken to the camera. Introduced in the 1850s the Collodion process was introduced. It used what were called wet plates. But a wet plate had to be prepared and used within minutes. It also had a very slow photographic speed. The preparation of wet plates required numerous chemicals. These had to be mixed in the dark in a portable tent if the photographer was planning on photographing away from the studio. In the 1880s the gelatin dry plate replaced the wet plates. The dry plate allowed much faster exposure times. Now a moving subject could be captured on film. The dry plates could be manufactured in a factory and used whenever the photographer wanted."}

It was directed by Richard Lowenstein. It starred Michael Hutchence as Sam, a drugged dazed singer of a band named Dogs in Space.\nThe story was from Lowenstein's personal experience of living in a shared house in Melbourne in the late 1970s. Lowenstein had already worked with Michael Hutchence making rock videos. He also produced video clips for songs from the INXS album \"The Swing\". He wrote the lead role of Sam with Michael Hutchence in mind.\nThe character Sam is about a real member of a punk rock band that Lowenstein had lived with in the 1970s. The house in the movie was the one they had shared. It was rented from its new owners and changed back to its original condition for the movie. The cost for the deconstruction of the house was part of the movie's budget.\nCopies of \"Dogs in Space\" are being preserved by the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra. This means the movie will be protected from damage that happens to older film that was used to make movies.\nPlot.\nA group of young music fans share a house in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond. It is not too far away from the city to be an active part of the music scene. Sam and Tim are members of a band named Dogs in Space. They share the house with a group of social misfits and quite troubled young people. These include Sam's girlfriend Anna and a really smart university student, Luchio. He is actually trying to study for exams even in the confusion of the house. There is also a nameless teenager, who is just called The Girl. She comes and goes; sometimes sleeping over.\nThe scenes cover the day-to-day lives of the characters, mainly the sexual relationship between Sam and Anna. There are many party scenes with live music and drug use. During quiet times, the housemates move the television outdoors into the street to watch it on sofas and eat junk food and drink beer. The group makes frequent trips to a convenience store to restock.\nFootage of Sputnik 2 is intermittently seen in the movie (in tribute to the title: \"Dogs in Space\"). The footage mostly shows Laika, the first Soviet Union dog in space. These scenes can also be seen in the background when the television is playing. There are trips to many local pubs for live punk music. In the end, the group's dangerous lifestyle costs a life of a loved one. Anna dies from a heroin overdose.\nSoundtrack album.\nThere was a punk rock soundtrack album released with the following songs and artists. The album and the later CD are both out of print. Rare copies sell well and fetch the asking price.\nSide One:\nSide Two:"}
