Her name means \"Okuni from Izumo\". Her performing arts evolved from traditional dancing. Okuni founded kabuki.\nBirth.\nShe is from Izumo Taisha shrine in the late 16th century. She was a daughter of Sanemon Nakamura but it is not sure when she was born and died.\nHer early dancing.\nShe started to dance Kagura-mai and Nenbutsu-odori (two traditional dances) in kimono in order to gather money for repairing Izumo Taisha. Although dance was holy at that time, Okuni went on stage in the highest fashion. She inserted a song and character of ghost on stage. It became popular because it was unique.\nOrigin of kabuki.\nAt first Okuni danced simple dances. Later, she danced with clothing of a man, and showed at the Kitano Tenmangutemple in 1603. This became the first kabuki. \nOkuni's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. In particular, Okuni herself was best known for her roles as samurai and Christian priests. As her group gained fame, she was copied by many others, particularly brothels. They offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, and get prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female groups became known as shibai, onnakabuki, (from onna, the Japanese word for \"woman\" or \"girl\") and Okuni kabuki.\nIn 1629, due to public outcry for moral reform, those under the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu forbade women from performing in kabuki."}

It happened on April 3, 2016 at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It was the third WrestleMania to take place in Texas. WWE also hoped that WrestleMania 32 would break the record for people to show up at a wrestling event, aiming for 100,000 people at AT&amp;T Stadium. At the event they said 101,763 people showed up at WrestleMania 32, breaking 1987's WrestleMania III's record of 93,173. However, wrestling expert Dave Meltzer said only 93,730 people showed up. But this still would break WrestleMania III's record. But Meltzer adds that he believes the record was actually held by SummerSlam's (1992) 79,127 while only 78,000 actually showed up for WrestleMania III. Meltzer has also written that WWE would have said the attendance was higher than it actually was because they didn't want to let their fans down. \nTwelve matches took place at this event and at least two made history. Charlotte went into her match as the WWE Divas Champion, but became WWE Women's Champion at the end of the match and the Divas title has not existed since. After The Rock defeated Erick Rowan, ring announcer Lilian Garcia said that the match ended in six seconds, a WrestleMania record. The previous record wasKane versus Chavo Guerrero, Jr. from WrestleMania XXIV which lasted eleven seconds. \nMatches.\nFandango, Damien Sandow, Shaquille O'Neil, Big Show, Viktor, Diamond Dallas Page, Konnor, Tatanka, Jack Swagger, R-Truth, Goldust, Curtis Axel, Adam Rose, Heath Slater, Tyler Breeze, Mark Henry, Bo Dallas and Darren Young were also in the Andre the Giant memorial battle royal and they were eliminated in that order.

It is by far the largest network of its kind in the Americas. It operates as part of the Toronto Transit Commission's public transport network, and shares a common fare system with buses and subway services.\nUnlike modern light rail systems that are becoming more commonplace in North America, streetcars runs on city streets and call at frequent bus-type stops, where the passenger waits on the sidewalk for the next streetcar and pays his or her fare on board the vehicle. There are 685 of these stops, eight of which are shared with and connect to the subway system. The system mainly serves the downtown and waterfront areas of the city, and acts as feeder routes to the subway.\nThe system, which has been one of the longest in continuous operation, was opened in 1861 as a horse tramway. The system was bought by the Toronto Railway Company in 1891 and it was electrified in 1892. Vehicles run on of tracks with a non-standard gauge of and collect power from overhead lines at 600 V DC using trolley poles mounted on each streetcar.\nMore than 300,000 people ride the system on an average weekday, and about 100 million on an annual basis, making it among the busiest systems in the world."}

Hunting game birds is a sport, and a way of getting food. Usually there are laws which govern the hunting. Usually, guns are used, and so there are gun laws. Also, regulations protect the birds' breeding season, so that another generation of birds will grow to replace the present generation.\nAlthough the birds are wild, most of them are \"managed\" if they live on estates. Birds which migrate cannot be managed in the same way. Shooting game birds on Scottish estates is for them a major source of income. The managing consists of making sure there are enough birds for the next shooting season. \nIn the United Kingdom game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other (non-game birds) that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

It runs public awareness campaigns and petitions, and it operates nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.\nThe RSPB has 2,000 employees, 17,600 volunteers and more than a million members (including 150,000 youth members). It is the largest wildlife conservation charity in Europe. The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 200 nature reserves.\nThe group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.\nThe original members of the RSPB were all women. They campaigned against the fashion of wearing exotic feathers in hats. To this end the Society had two simple rules:\nAt the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 0.4 million birds from the West Indies and Brazil, and 0.36 million birds from British India.\nThe Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. The organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII. It petitioned Parliament to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing."}

Coppens won the first Belgian Golden Shoe in 1954.\nFor many he's unknown but for others he's the famous creator of the 'Johan Cruyff' penalty.\nCreation of the 'Johan Cruyff' penalty.\n5 June, 1957, Belgium was facing Iceland in a World Cup Qualification match. The match started perfectly for Les Diables Rouges who soon were leading the game by a ludicrous 6-1 against a weak and pretty much unknown adversary who still had to face over forty-five minutes of pain.\n44' minute of the game, near the end of the first-half, referee whistles for what would be one of the best penalties of the entire history. 'Rik' Coppens was the one chosen to be the executioner of it but instead of shooting directly to the net, he passed to his teammate Andr\u00e9 Piters who shot for the 7-1. The game didn't ended there, the second half was open for more goals, specially for Iceland, but were not enough to change a sure winner since it ended with a magnificent 8-3 and with a penalty that changed an entire nation of football lovers since then.\nThis particular way of scoring a penalty, the two-man penalty, was remade by many over the years, and even failed by many like Thierry Henry and Robert Pir\u00e8s, but when someone talks about this particular style of scoring there is one name that immediately pops up \u2013 Johan Cruyff. A player who, with the help of his teammate Jasper Olsen, when both were players of Ajax, scored one of this amazing penalties against .\nCruyff passed the ball to Jasper who then passed it back to a magnificent and cruel finish that many will remember for years.\nLate years.\nAfter his career as a player, he became a coach with Tubantia Borgerhout (1970-1971), Berchem (1971-1974 and 1977-1981), Beerschot (1974-1977 and 1981-1984) and Club Brugge (1981)."}

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (commonly called the Kennedy Center) is a performing arts center in Washington, D.C. The Center opened on September 8, 1971. It shows theater, dance, ballet, orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, and folk music performances.\nIt is the busiest performing arts center in the United States of America. Each year, it hosts about 2,000 performances, and almost two million people watch one of these performances. The Center presents music, dance, and theater to the public; helps artists make new works and does arts education.\nThe \"National Cultural Center Act\" of Congress in 1958 requires that its programming must be paid for through private money. The center is a public-private partnership. It mostly gets its money from ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations. It also gets federal funding each year to pay for the maintenance and operation of the building. It is both the nation's public memorial to President John F. Kennedy and the \"national center for the performing arts.\"\nThe building was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, and is administered by a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution.\nHistory.\nIn 1933, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt first had the idea for the center. It was during the Great Depression, and she thought the government should provide jobs for unemployed actors. In 1935 and 1938, the United States Congress talked about making a building for it in Washington D.C., but the only thing they did was add a small auditorium to the Library of Congress.\nIn 1950, Representative Arthur George Klein proposed a bill to build a cultural center. Congress debated the bill between 1955 and 1958. The bill was passed in summer 1958 and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 4, 1958.\nThis was the first time that the federal government provided money for a structure dedicated to the performing arts. It cost a total of $70 million to build it. Congress gave most of the money, but donations from foundations, individuals, and businesses were also given.\nConstruction and Opening.\nEdward Durell Stone was chosen as the architect.\nConstruction of the building began on December 11, 1965.\nThe first performance was September 5, 1971, with a premiere of Leonard Bernstein's \"Mass\" in the Opera House. The Center officially opened on September 8, 1971, with a formal gala and premiere performance of the Bernstein \"Mass\". The Concert Hall was first used on September 9, 1971, and the Eisenhower Theater was first used on October 18, 1971.\nIt was first called The National Cultural Center, but it was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, to honor John F. Kennedy after his assassination.\nChanges (1990-2005).\nBy 1990, the Kennedy Center facility was in bad condition. In 1991 and 1992, Congress recommended that $27.7 million be spent to restore the center and improve handicapped access. There were more improvements between 1995 and 2005.\nKennedy Center Honors.\nEach year since 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors have been awarded by the Center's Board of Trustees. Each year, five artists or groups are honored for the contributions that they have made throughout their life to American culture and the performing arts. They are awarded to people in dance, music, theater, opera, film, and television. The Center has awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since 1998.\nDepartment of VSA and Accessibility.\nThe Department of VSA (Very Special Arts) and Accessibility (formerly VSA Arts) is an international nonprofit organization. It was started in 1974 by Ambassadress Jean Kennedy Smith. It helps people with disabilities learn through, participate in, and enjoy the arts. VSA provides educators, parents, and artists with resources to support arts programming in schools and communities. VSA also shows the works of artists with disabilities. Affiliated with the Kennedy Center since 2005, VSA was official merged into the organization in 2011 to become part of the Center's Department of VSA and Accessibility.\nManagement.\nBefore 1980, the board of directors and its chairman were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the center. Other parts of the center's programming and operations were overseen by other people.\nCurrently, the artistic director is in charge of artistic programming, the center's president is in charge of the center's day-to-day operations, and The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees is in charge of the building."}

He wrote several best-selling cookbooks. Smith was the host of \"The Frugal Gourmet\", a long running American cooking show. He was called \"the most visible gourmet\" of the 1980s by Time Magazine.\nCareer.\nSmith was born in Tacoma, Washington on January 22, 1939. He graduated from the University of Puget Sound with a degree in philosophy and sociology in 1962. When he graduated from Drew University in 1965, Smith began teaching cooking classes to his students called \"Food as Sacrament and Celebration\", and was ordained as a minister in the United Methodist church. Smith came back to the University of Puget Sound, to become a chaplain of Aldergate Methodist Church in 1966, and married his wife Patricia \"Patty\" Smith that same year. In 1972, Smith and his students opened and ran a deli and kitchen supply store in Tacoma, Washington, called Chaplain's Pantry Restaurant and Gourmet Shop. In 1973, Smith began his television career with his first cooking show, \"Cooking Fish Creatively\", on a local Tacoma, Washington PBS station, KTPS-TV. The first six episodes of \"Cooking Fish Creatively\" were broadcast in black and white, and then, the station began using federal grant for color cameras, because Smith was asked to design a new cooking show, he called it \"The Frugal Gourmet\". The name was suggested by his wife, Patty. The program was later moved to WTTW-TV in Chicago, and then, by KQED in San Francisco, and A La Carte Communications, where it aired nationally on PBS from 1983 to 1997. Known himself as \"The Frugal Gourmet\", Smith's nickname quickly became \"The Frug\". Smith always appeared wearing his \"trademark\" blue and white striped apron. His first cookbook, \"Recipes from The Frugal Gourmet\", was published in 1977. The theme music for \"The Frugal Gourmet\" was the Bourree movement from \"Water Music\" by George Frideric Handel. When Jeff Smith released his first hardcover cookbook in 1984, he hit the talk show circuit.\nIn 1981, Smith had heart valve surgery. He was forced to sell the Chaplain's Pantry to pay the huge medical costs. In 1983, he was interviewed on the Phil Donahue show promoting his paperback cookbook. After that, Smith sold 45,000 copies at $4.75 each. The profits allowed him to get out of debt. In 1983, PBS station WTTW in Chicago picked up his show and aired it nationally. The show aired for 14 years, a total of 261 episode. Smith ended every episode of \"The Frugal Gourmet\" by saying, \"Until I see you again, this is the Frugal Gourmet. I bid you peace, bye-bye\". Smith was also quoted as saying \"frugal does not mean cheap.\" He explained, \"A frugal gourmet is a thrifty person who enjoys good food.\"\nSmith appeared in television commercials for Columbia Crest Wines. In 1995, Smith hosted \"The Frugal Gourmet Keeps the Feast\" for the Odyssey Television Network, and then, he retired from television, leaving behind a legacy of loyal of fans, with lots of garlic. That same year, he acted in the movie \"Grumpier Old Men\".\nScandal.\nIn 1997, seven men filed lawsuits against him for alleged sexual abuse. Six of the men said they were abused when they were younger and worked at the Chaplain's Pantry. The case never went to court. Smith said the abuse never happened. The \"Frugal Gourmet\" empire ended with the scandal.\nPersonal life.\nSmith married his wife Patricia in 1966. They had two sons, Channing and Jason. Patricia is credited by originating the nickname \"Frugal Gourmet\".\nDeath.\nSmith died in his sleep in Seattle on July 7, 2004 at the age of 65. He had suffered from heart disease for a long time. Smith was survived by his wife Patricia, and sons Channing and Jason, as well as daughters-in-law Yuki and Lisa."}

The small flowers are arranged in round groups. Only the male part of the flower sticks out.\nRed-eyed wattle can be used to help stabilise coastal sands. It was introduced into Africa for this purpose, but it has spread fast and is now a serious pest in South Africa, where it is known as 'rooikrans' (= 'red garland' in Afrikaans).\nThe green seed pods may be used as a natural soap, by crushing them and using the pods with water to wash with."}

Emporia is between Topeka and Wichita at the intersection of U.S. Route 50, Interstates 335 and 35 on the Kansas Turnpike. Emporia is also a college town because it has Emporia State University and Flint Hills Technical College.\nHistory.\nEmporia was created in 1857.

If you had 10,000 white blood cells, only 1\u201330 of them would be basophils.\nBasophils contain large cytoplasmic granules. When stained, the granules hide the cell nucleus from sight. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes.\nThe mast cell, another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they come from different cell lines. Mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead stay in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils go from the blood into a tissue when needed.\nThe name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are stained by basic dyes, as shown in the illustrations.\nHow they work is not well understood. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell membrane which binds IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defence and allergy. They are found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection, for example, by ticks."}

Stains and dyes are often used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues, often with the aid of different microscopes.\nStaining can be done on living tissues (\"in vivo\") or on dead tissues (\"in\" \"vitro\").\nPreparation.\nDead tissue needs to be \"fixed\" so it does not decay. The fixative keeps the structure as it is. After fixation a tissue may be cut into thin slices, and put on a series of glass microscope slides. Occasionally, it is necessary to dissolve cell membranes so large dye molecules can get into the cells. Standards are published in the \"Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry\" journal.\nStaining.\nThe simplest way is to dip the slide plus specimen into a solution of dye, then rinse it and examine. The stains used are certified stains, tested by the Biological Stain Commission.\nStaining bacteria.\nGram staining is used to classify bacteria. It is based on the composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a counterstain which marks all bacteria.\nGram-positive bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their cell wall lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.\nOn most Gram-stained preparations, Gram-negative organisms are red or pink from the counterstain.\nStaining tissues.\nHaematoxylin and eosin staining is often used in histology for thin sections of tissue. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.\nEosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H &amp; E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) go different shades of pink. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.\nA quick and simple stain used on blood smears, and human cheek cells is methylene blue, which stains the nuclei. There are many other specialist stains, some fluorescent under special light."}

It is calculated from one crescent moon to the next crescent moon. A feature of the Islamic calendar is that a year is always 12 months. So the months are not linked with the seasons. They drift each solar year by 11 to 12 days. It comes back to the position it had in relation to the solar year approximately every 33 Islamic years. It is used mainly for religious purposes, but in Saudi Arabia it is the official calendar.

They lived from the early Eocene to the late Oligocene, 5523 million years ago (mya). They were the first cetacean radiation, and they include the first amphibious stages in cetacean evolution. So they are the ancestors of both modern cetacean suborders, Mysticeti and Odontoceti.\nThe group evolved in the shallow waters that separated India and Asia 55\u201345 mya. About 30 species have been found which were adapted to a fully oceanic life. Modern characters such as echolocation and filter-feeding evolved later, in a second radiation .\nAll archaeocetes from 55 to 48 mya are only from Indo-Pakistan. By 41\u201334 mya genera are known from across the Earth, including North America, Egypt, New Zealand, and Europe. They were very unlikely to be as well-adapted to the open ocean as living cetaceans, so they probably got to North America along coastal waters. They could have gone around Africa and over to South America. More likely, over the Tethys Sea (between Eurasia and Africa) and along the coasts of Europe, Greenland, and North America.\nThe group is a paraphyletic because it gave rise to the two separate modern suborders."}

Each transcription factor binds to a specific DNA sequence. That is how they control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA.\nA transcription factor is sometimes called a 'sequence-specific DNA-binding factor'.

Because they lack DNA-binding domains, they are not called transcription factors.\nGlossary:"}

When a database programmer wants to do a join command, they will type about the databases they want to get information from, and the type of join they want to use. There are five types of joins. A normal codice_1, which is also called an codice_2, a codice_3, acodice_4, acodice_5 and codice_6. \nIn order for a join to work, there must be information in the tables to be joined that is the same between them. \nJoin (Also called an Inner Join).\nImagine two tables called Employee and Department.\nSuppose a database administrator wanted to know what employee worked in what department. While someone could just compare the ID numbers between the two tables, a way to have the information in one place is by doing a JOIN, also known as an INNER JOIN. Because they have one type of data in common, the department ID, the tables can be joined together.\nIt would make a table that looks like this:\nBecause Williams in the employee table did not have an department ID, Williams was not printed in the final result.\nOuter Join.\nInner joins are fine if both tables have a matching record. However, if one table does not have a record for what the join is being built on, the query will fail. But if a database programmer needs to grab information in an event that there is not a matching record for a row on one of the tables, they need to use an outer join.\nLeft Outer Join (Also known as a Left Join).\nA left outer join (also known as a left join) will contain all records from the left table, even if the right table does not have a matching record for each row. \nSo, using the two tables.\nThis command is run, which joins the two tables together on a left join.\nUnlike the inner join, Williams is printed in the final result, even though Williams did not have a department ID. Because Employee was the left table, or the table first mentioned in the SQL query, SQL returns all of the relevant data needed from it. However, since there was not a department ID for Williams, the Department table was only able to return a null result.\nRight Outer Join (Also known as a Right Join).\nA right outer join works almost like a left outer join, except with how the tables are handled reversed. This time, all of the relevant information will be returned from the right table, even if the left table does not have a matching result. If the left table does not have a matching result, null will be in the place of the missing data.\nThis command is run, which joins the two tables together on a right join.\nAnd this is the final result.\nFlexibility of Joins.\nExcept for how the tables are treated, left outer joins, and right outer joints work alike. This means, in the left outer join example, if a database programmer were to switch the order of the tables listed from this:\nto this (notice how employee and department have switched places)\nThey would receive the same result as the right outer join example above:"}

They lived during the mid- to late-Mesozoic era. \nThey had sophisticated molars, from which the suborder gets its name. In the fossil record, isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found. \nDocodonts are not quite as closely related to the placentals and marsupials as the monotremes are, so they are not included among the crown-group mammals. \nBecause of their molars and their lower jaw being a single bone (the dentary), they are generally regarded as mammals. However, those authors who limit the term \"Mammalia\" to the (living) crown group exclude docodonts. They use the term mammaliaformes instead.\nDocodonts were primarily herbivorous or insectivorous. However, \"Castorocauda\", adapted to a semi-aquatic life, has teeth which suggest it ate fish.\n\"Castorocauda\" is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology). It breaks the \"small nocturnal insectivore\" stereotype.\nIt was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils, and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Of course, this strongly suggests mammalian-type temperature regulation."}

Wilhelm played with the New York Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, California Angels, Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He played between 1952 and 1972. He was the first relief pitcher in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nWilhelm did not enter the major leagues until his late twenties. He fought in World War II before playing Major League Baseball. He was known to throw a knuckleball. He sometimes played as a starting pitcher but most of the time played as a relief pitcher. Wilhem won 124 games which is more than any other relief pitcher. He was also the first pitcher to reach 200 saves and play in 1,000 games. \nHe pitched until he was almost 50 years old. Wilhelm retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages in baseball history. Wilhelm coached the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves many years after his retirement. He was a resident of Sarasota, Florida for a long time and died in a nursing home of heart failure in 2002.\nEarly Life.\nWilhem was born on July 26, 1922, in Huntersville, North Carolina. His parents, John and Ethel (n\u00e9e Stanley) Wilhelm, were tenant farmers and had eleven children. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There he started trying to throw the knuckleball. Because he could not throw very fast, he thought that being able to throw a knuckleball would make him successful. He used a tennis ball to practice.\nWilhem started playing Minor League Baseball in 1942. He served in the United States Army during World War II. Wilhem fought in the Battle of the Bulge and was wounded. He also earned the Purple Heart award. In the military, Wilhem reached the rank of staff sergeant. He was nicknamed \"Old Sarge\" because he served in the military.\nAfter serving in the military, he returned to playing minor league baseball in 1946. The New York Giants drafted Wilhem in the 1947 minor league draft. This is when he started playing in the major leagues."}

This is sometimes referred to as the Step Tomb due to its rectangular base, and its 'steps' (mastabas: the Arabic word for 'bench'). It is about south of Cairo.\nDjoser's pyramid is the oldest complete stone building complex known. It was built in the Third Dynasty. Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara: these pyramids are now in various states of preservation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the whole pharaonic period. It was an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000\u00a0years, well into Ptolemaic and Roman times.\nIn 2018, an undisturbed tomb was discovered. It is believed to be the tomb of the royal priest Wahtye. The intact interior includes figures with colors on sculptures and wall carvings.\nThe area from Giza to Dahshur was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The official name is \"Memphis and its Necropolis \u2013 the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur\". \nSome scholars think the name 'Saqqara' is not taken from the ancient Egyptian funerary god Sokar, but from a supposed local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar."}

While it was similar to the Cape York melomys it had some protein differences and a coarser tail. It was genetically different to species from Australia and New Guinea. It lived in burrows it had dug among plants, or under branches and leaves on the ground. It was a nocturnal animal, and scientists believe it was a vegetarian.\nThe Bramble Cay melomys was known only from a small population in Bramble Cay, a vegetated coral cay of . The cay is in the eastern part of Torres Strait, off the northern tip of Australia. It is only 50\u00a0km from New Guinea. The melomys were probably trapped on the island by rising sea levels after the last ice age. It is also possible to have come from the Fly River, perhaps floating on branches. Scientists do not know much about the animals that live in the Fly River area.\nIn the 1800s, there were lots of melomys on the island. A search in 1998 found 42 animals. Another search in 2002 found 10 animals. In 2004 a search found 12, but the melomys have not been seen since. During this time, the sea level has risen, making the island smaller, and turtles and sea birds have eaten most of the plants. Scientists believe the Bramble Cay melomys is extinct. It is possible that the species may be found on nearby islands as many of these have never been searched. However, in June 2016, researchers from Queensland's Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, and the University of Queensland reported that the species had indeed become extinct."}

They have a rectangular body, thick muscles and a massive head with a wrinkled forehead. They stand from to at the shoulder and typically weigh between and . The Mastiff is one of the largest breeds of dogs who can outweigh many full-grown men. They can be gentle with family members but are also excellent guard dogs.\nHistory.\nThe early Mastiff was called a molosser or molossus. Genetics and breeding dogs to get certain characteristics was unknown then. In 350 BC, Aristotle wrote that the ancestor of the Mastiff was the Molosser. These were the war dogs and guard dogs kept by the Molossoi people, an ancient Greek tribe. Today the two names are often used to mean the same group or family of dogs. For example, the modern St. Bernard is sometimes described as a mastiff and sometimes as a molosser type.\nMastiff or Molosser breeds.\nWhile the Mastiff is a recognized breed, there are also a number of working dog varieties that are closely related to the Mastiff. Many prefer to class them as molosser breeds so as not to confuse them with the Mastiff dog breed. Currently there are about 14 different breeds in the molosser/mastiff family of dogs that are bred from or have a common ancestor with the Mastiff. These include the:\nThere are also a large number of dog breeds not called molossers or mastiffs, but are related to them. Some of these include the:\nThe list includes many more.\nTraining and temperament.\nWhen training a Mastiff, it is important to recognize they have a certain personality type that needs additional time and patience to learn things. A Mastiff is a very relaxed dog and takes his or her time in doing a task. Owners call this the \"Mastiff tempo\". A Mastiff can't be trained the same as a Border Collie. In temperament, a modern Mastiff is a patient, sweet-tempered family guardian and companion. Gentle training works best. It is important to start that training early in puppyhood. They are a dog of tremendous size and strength and owning a Mastiff is a large responsibility.\nMastiffs are very predictable when they are facing a threat to their family. If an owner and another person act in a threatening way, the Mastiff will usually get between them to protect its owner. This is hard for the other person to miss and usually results in a cooling down of a heated discussion. But, if the situation does get worse, the Mastiff will usually growl or snarl at the other person as a warning. \nEarly socialization is important so the Mastiff knows who belongs in the house and who does not. For example, if a Mastiff puppy sees strangers coming and going all the time, they tend to see this as normal and might not recognize an intruder if they see one. However, a properly trained and socialized Mastiff will usually corner a burglar or intruder. Unless the intruder does something foolish, like try to hurt the dog, he or she will probably not be hurt."}

A haplotype is a collection of specific alleles (particular DNA sequences) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome. A cluster is usually inherited together. Put simply, haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent.\nA second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) usually found together on a single chromatid (of a chromosome pair). So, finding a few alleles of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region. Such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common diseases.\nComparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines. It is done in genetic genealogy projects."}

A SNP is just a single nucleotide difference in the genome. \nFor example, sequenced DNA fragments from two people, AAGCCTA to AAGCTTA, is different in a single nucleotide. In this case we say that there are two \"alleles\". Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. SNPs occur most often in regions of the DNA which do not affect the survival of the organism: otherwise they would be weeded out by natural selection. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also affect SNP density. There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.\nThese genetic variations between individuals (particularly in non-coding parts of the genome) are sometimes exploited in DNA fingerprinting, which is used in forensic science. Also, these genetic variations cause differences in our susceptibility to disease. The severity of illness and the way our body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a single base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease."}

They travel in \"swarms\" with many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. The swarm puts out extracellular enzymes to digest food. This increases feeding efficiency. \nLife cycle.\nWhen nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into \"fruiting bodies\". These fruiting bodies are different shapes and colours, depending on the species. \nInside the fruiting bodies, cells develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, like spores in other organisms, survive until nutrients are more plentiful. Then cell growth is restarted with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, not just isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the amoebae called cellular slime moulds.\nUses.\nMyxobacteria produce a number of biomedically and industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those chemicals outside of the cell. Some myxobacteria are used as model organisms for the study of development. At a molecular level, initiation of fruiting body development is regulated by Pxr sRNA."}

She has been walking their fashion show since 2000. From 2004 to 2006 she worked mainly for their younger line, PINK, and is now working for the main line. In 2008, she walked the fashion show three months after giving birth to her daughter. The following year, she opened the fashion show.\nIn 2012, she was selected to wear the \"Fantasy Bra\". That year, it was called the \"Floral Fantasy Bra\". It was created by London Jewelers and featured amethysts, rubies, sapphires and diamonds (including a 20-carat white diamond in the center), making it worth $2,500,000. She walked during the last segment of the year's fashion while wearing it with wings.\nIn 2014, she was selected to wear the Fantasy Bra again, but this time there were two bras : the \"Dream Angels Fantasy Bras\" worn by herself and fellow Angel Adriana Lima. Each one of them is worth $2,000,000 and they opened a segment of the year's fashion show while wearing them. It is Alessandra Ambrosio's second Fantasy Bra and Adriana Lima's third.\nPersonal life.\nAlessandra Ambrosio became engaged to Jamie Mazur in 2008.

To show their true gender as men, trans men may transition from living as women to living as men. A trans man's transition can include telling family and friends, wearing different clothes, flattening the chest, using a new name, changing legal papers, using medical treatments of testosterone, and changing the body with surgery. Getting medical care can be more difficult for trans men because some doctors will not help them or they cannot afford it. Trans men can also face discrimination because they are transgender.\nNot all trans men are straight (attracted to women). Some trans men are gay (attracted to men), bisexual, or asexual.

He asked his readers to create a definition for the word \"santorum\" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's opinions about homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that \"In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be.\" Savage announced the winning entry, which defined \"santorum\" as \"the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex\". He created a web site, \"spreadingsantorum.com\" (and \"santorum.com\"), to promote the definition.\nIn 2010 Savage said he would take the site down if Santorum donated US$5 million plus interest to Freedom to Marry. That group supports legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to remove the definition from its search engine index. Google refused.

She was a silent movie star who appeared in movies from 1916 through 1926. She married a wealthy banker and retired from the movie industry. In her later years she was famous for her philanthropy.\nCareer.\nDempster was born December 9, 1901 in Duluth, Minnesota. She was the youngest of four children. Her father was John W. Dempster and her mother was Carrie M. (Acker) Dempster. Her father changed careers when Carol was still a baby and moved the family to California.\nShe studied dance at the Ruth St. Denis dancing school. There she was noticed by movie director D. W. Griffith who used her as a dancer in his movie \"Intolerance\" (1916). Griffith then gave her a role in \"A Romance of Happy Valley\" (1919). The movie featured the popular acting team of Robert Herron and Lillian Gish. Dempster's first starring role came in the movie \"The Girl Who Stayed at Home\" (1919). Lillian Gish was supposed to get the role, but was reportedly \"tired\" and Griffith cast Dempster instead. Critics gave Dempster only mild praise. Her first solo starring role was in \"The Love Flower\" (1920). It was at this time critics began comparing her to Lillian Gish. But it was Griffith who directed her to sound like Gish and his other legendary female stars. It was about this time that Dempster became romantically involved with Griffith. Her first non-Griffith movie was in 1922. She starred in \"Sherlock Holmes\" with John Barrymore. Her movie \"Isn't Life Wonderful?\" (1924) was well received by critics. She starred in two movies with W. C. Fields for Paramount Pictures, \"Sally of the Sawdust\" (1925), and \"That Royle Girl\" (1925). Her best performance may have been in her last movie \"The Sorrows of Satan\" (1926).\nLater life.\nIn July 1929 Dempster was scarred in a car accident in California. A month later she married wealthy investment banker Edwin Skinner Larsen at her rural New York home. After the couple traveled to Europe, Dempster announced her retirement from acting. She and her husband lived in La Jolla, California. She died there on February 1, 1991 from heart failure. Carol Dempster was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale, California. Upon her death, Dempster left $1.6 million USD to the San Diego Museum of Art. The money was to add to the museum's collections of prints and drawings. She and her husband had made several previous gifts to the museum. These included Francisco Zuniga's sculpture \"Mother and Daughter Seated\" and Thomas Eakins' painting \"Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog\"."}

It was called the \"new monastery\". \nIn 1571 and 1591, the wooden buildings were attacked by the Crimean Tatars. In 1612, the Tsar, Michael of Russia, had the monastery completely rebuilt. This included the thick stone walls which made it one of the fortified monasteries on the edge of Moscow. These new stone walls were 7.5 meters high and 2 meters thick. They were 782 meters in length, and included six towers. These are the buildings which are still standing. The bell-tower, one of the tallest in Moscow, and the Sheremetev sepulchre in the church of the Sign, were added in the 18th century,\nThe monastery was supported by Andrei Kobyla's descendants, including the Sheremetyev and Romanov boyars.

It starts in the Early Dynastic Period, before 3100 BC. It ends with the Ptolemaic Dynasty, when Egypt became a province of Rome under Julius Caesar in 30 BC.\nThe dates given are approximate. The list of pharaohs uses the dates of Ancient Egypt, developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.\nOld lists of pharaohs.\nThere are old lists of pharaohs which have been discovered. These are not complete:\nOther lists can be found in Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eratosthenes. Two other lists are not believed to be reliable, these are the work of \"the Arabic writers\", and the \"Book of Sothis\".\nLegendary period.\nIn the legendary period, there were eight god kings who ruled over Egypt. The Palermo, Turin and Manetho king lists, have different names for the eight god kings.\nThe god kings were followed by kings who were part god and part human. The old lists are different in naming these rulers.\nArchaic period.\nThe Archaic period includes the Early Dynastic Period, when Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were ruled as separate kingdoms.\nEarly Dynastic: Lower Egypt.\nLower Egypt was the northern Nile and the Nile Delta. The list may not be complete:\nEarly Dynastic: Upper Egypt.\nUpper Egypt was the Nile Valley, south of the Delta. The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence):\nFirst Dynasty.\nThe First Dynasty ruled from about 3150 to 2890 BC.\nIn the interregnum between the first and second dynasties, two short lived pharaohs may have reigned :\nSecond Dynasty.\nThe Second Dynasty ruled c. 2890\u20132686 BC.\nOld Kingdom.\nThe Old Kingdom was a peak of civilisation and achievement. This was the first of three so-called \"Kingdom\" periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley. It began when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty (2686\u20132181 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity called the First Intermediate Period, or as the Egyptians called it, the \"first illness.\"\nThe royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was at Memphis. This is where Djoser set up his court. The Old Kingdom is known for the large number of pyramids. These were built as tombs for the pharoahs. The Old Kingdom is called \"the Age of the Pyramids\".\nThird Dynasty.\nThe Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.\nFourth Dynasty.\nThe Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC. It included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu (Cheops), Khafra (Chephren) and Menkaura (Mycerinus).\nFifth Dynasty.\nThe Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2498 to 2345 BC.\nSixth Dynasty.\nThe Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.\nFirst Intermediate Period.\nThe First Intermediate Period (2181\u20132060 BC) is between the end of the Old Kingdom and the start of the Middle Kingdom.\nThe Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age.\nThe Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.\nAround 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. Another line of pharaohs at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable.\nAround 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. This was the start of the Middle Kingdom.\nSeventh and Eighth Dynasties (combined).\nThe Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from c. 2181 to c. 2160 BC. Many of the kings only ruled for a short time from Memphis, with Egypt divided into competing regions.\nThis table is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I, and the Turin canon.\nNinth Dynasty.\nThe Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC. The Turin King List has 18 kings in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are not complete.\nTenth Dynasty.\nThe Tenth Dynasty was a local group that ruled over Lower Egypt from 2130 to 2040 BC.\nEleventh Dynasty.\nThe Eleventh Dynasty was a local group from Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC. The 11th dynasty came from a group of Theban nomarchs who served the kings of the 8th, 9th or 10th dynasty.\nThe successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.\nMiddle Kingdom.\nThe Middle Kingdom (2060\u20131802 BC) started at the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. Some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom began to trade outside of the kingdom. This opening of trade led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, caused by an invasion from the Hyksos.\nEleventh Dynasty continued.\nThe second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.\nTwelfth Dynasty.\nThe Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC. It is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty.\nSecond Intermediate Period.\nThe Second Intermediate Period (1802\u20131550 BC) was a time of chaos between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. During this time, the Hyksos, who later became the Fifteenth Dynasty, arrived in Egypt.\nThe Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.\nThe Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV. About 1720 BC they took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. About 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, which ended the 13th dynasty. When the 13th dynasty collapsed, the 16th dynasty to declared its independence in Thebes. It was soon taken over by the Hyksos kings..\nWhen the Hyksos left Upper Egypt, the Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom, forced the Hyksos out of Egypt and back into Asia\nThirteenth Dynasty.\nThe Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC. Manetho said it lasted for about 154 years. \nThe position of the following kings is uncertain:\nFourteenth Dynasty.\nThe Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Avaris. They ruled from either from 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC until around 1650 BC. The dynasty had many rulers with West Semitic names and is believed to have been Canaanite in origin.\nThe position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:\nThe Turin King List has extra names, but no other evidence has been found.\nFifteenth Dynasty.\nThe Fifteenth Dynasty was started by the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent. They ruled over much of the Nile region, from 1674 to 1535 BC.\nAbydos Dynasty.\nThe Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from c. 1650 BC until 1600 BC. There are four known kings in the Abydos Dynasty, the order in which they ruled is unknown:\nSixteenth Dynasty.\nThe Sixteenth Dynasty was a native Theban dynasty. It began during the collapse of the Memphis-based 13th dynasty c. 1650 BC and finally conquered by the Hyksos 15th dynasty c. 1580 BC. The 16th dynasty only ruled over Upper-Egypt.\nThe 16th Dynasty may have included the pharaohs Sneferankhre Pepi III and Nebmaatre. Their chronological position is uncertain.\nSeventeenth Dynasty.\nThe Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC:\nThe early 17th Dynasty may also have included Nebmaatre, whose dates are uncertain.\nNew Kingdom.\nThe New Kingdom (1550\u20131077 BC) includes the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th to the 11th century BC. It is between the Second Intermediate Period and the Third Intermediate Period.\nDuring the New Kingdom, Egypt's armies were able to capture nearby countries. Egypt controlled Nubia in the south, and held territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria. During the New Kingdom, Egypt controlled more territory than at any other time in its history.\nTwo of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, worshipped the god Aten. This is seen as the first monotheistic religion. Ramesses II was a powerful military ruler. He tried to recapture the territories in what is now modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. At the Battle of Qadesh he led the Egyptian armies in battle against the Hittite king Muwatalli II.\nEighteenth Dynasty.\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from c. 1550 to 1292 BC:\nNineteenth Dynasty.\nThe Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs, Rameses II the Great:\nTwentieth Dynasty.\nThe Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1190 to 1077 BC:\nThird Intermediate Period.\nThe Third Intermediate Period (1077\u2013732 BC) marked the end of the New Kingdom. After the collapse of the Egyptian empire, some dynasties of Libyan origin ruled Egypt. This is also known as the Libyan Period.\nTwenty-First Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-First Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group. They were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt. They ruled from 1069 to 943 BC\nTwenty-Second Dynasty.\nThe pharaohs of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 943 to 728 BC:\nTwenty-Third Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-Third Dynasty was another Libyan group, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes. They ruled from 837 to c. 735 BC:\nRudamun was succeeded in Thebes by a local ruler: \nThe Libu.\nNot really a dynasty, the Libu were another group of western nomads from Libya who controlled the western Delta from 805 to 732 BC.\nTwenty-Fourth Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty in the western Delta (Sais). There were only two Pharaohs, ruling from 732 to 720 BC.\nLate period.\nThe Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians.\nTwenty-fifth Dynasty.\nNubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC.\nThey were forced from Egypt back into Nubia, where they set up a kingdom at Napata (656\u2013590), and, later, at Mero\u00eb (590 BC \u2013 4th century AD).\nTwenty-sixth Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 672 to 525 BC.\nTwenty-seventh Dynasty.\nEgypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC and ruled by the Persians until 404 BC. The Achaemenid shahs were the pharaohs in this era, forming a \"Twenty-seventh\" Dynasty:\nTwenty-eighth Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only six years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one Pharaoh:\nTwenty-ninth Dynasty.\nThe Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC:\nThirtieth Dynasty.\nThe Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 380 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule in 343 BC:\nThirty-first Dynasty.\nEgypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians. The Persian rulers from 343 to 332 BC are sometimes listed as the Thirty-first Dynasty:\nArgead Dynasty.\nThe Macedonians under Alexander the Great brought in the Hellenistic period with his capture of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:\nPtolemaic Dynasty.\nThe second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. If two dates overlap, that means there was a co-regency. The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII. In modern times she is known simply as Cleopatra. She was the consort of Julius Caesar and after Caesar's death, of Mark Antony, and had children with both of them. Cleopatra tried to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome. This failed with the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony. Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. He reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between Cleopatra's death on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own death on August 23, 30 BC, he was the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus, but there is no evidence.\nRome.\nCleopatra VII had affairs with the Roman Dictator Julius Caesar and Roman General Marc Antony. She killed herself when Antony was defeated by Octavian (later be Emperor Augustus). Egypt then became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Roman Emperors were given the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt. One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius.

Files are usually stored in one part. When a disk drive fills up, finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult. When this happens, the file is split into different parts, and each part is stored on a different place in the disk. That process is known as fragmentation. Fragmentation happens because different parts of a file are not stored next to eachother. When the file is read, the different parts must be assembled. Fragmented files are take longer to assemble. Files that are stored in one part can be read faster. Defragmentation reverses fragmentation and puts the file into one piece. \nThe process.\nDefragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts, so that they are stored next to each other. This is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk. Defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives. To read each part, the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored.\nThe problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases, the file system cannot be changed while it is in progress. For that reason, defragmentation should not be done, when it can be avoided.\nThere are different kinds of files, some of them are modified more often. It is often a good practice to put them on different partitions, as most Unix-like operating systems do. Also, the design of hard drives has changed over time, which will make the effects of defragmentation less visible.\nMedia that uses flash memory, such as solid-state disks, do not benefit from defragmentation, as there are no moving parts than need to be re-positioned.

A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. This is called breast budding. Within 6-12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About 1 and a half to 2 years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. Breast size depends on the body's amount of fat.\nThelarchic stage.\nIt is the Tanner 2 stage of breast development (a scale used to analyze changes in people from childhood to adulthood). The first stage is the non-developed prepubescent state of breasts. Thelarche is usually the first sign of puberty. It usually occurs after age 8, and is the first evidence of puberty in 60% of women. It usually ends at age 13. However, it can sometimes happen earlier. When this happens, it can be by itself (called isolated premature thelarche). It could also be a wider pattern of precocious puberty (sexual development happening too early). \nHormones.\nThe process is started by estradiol, the primary female sex hormone. Many young women are not prepared for thelarche, and this may result in stress. Teaching materials on breast development for elementary and middle schools has been suggested to promote breast health by reducing shame."}

The term Okefenokee in Native American is \"land of trembling earth\". The swamp was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. The Okefenokee Swamp is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. \nThe swamp was formed over the past 6,500 years by the build-up of peat in a shallow basin on the edge of an ancient Atlantic coastal terrace, the geological relic of a Pleistocene estuary. \nThe swamp is bordered by Trail Ridge, a strip of higher land believed to have formed as coastal dunes or an offshore barrier island. The Suwanee River drains at least 90% of the swamp's watershed southwest towards the Gulf of Mexico. \nLongtime residents of the Okefenokee Swamp, \"Swampers\", are mostly of English ancestry. Due to their isolation, the Swampers used Elizabethan phrases and syntax well into the twentieth century. The Suwanee Canal was dug across the swamp in the late nineteenth century in a failed attempt to drain the Okefenokee. After the Suwanee Canal Company's bankruptcy, most of the swamp was bought by the Hebard family of Philadelphia, who logged cypress from 1909 to 1927. Several other logging companies ran railroad lines into the swamp until 1942; some remains are visible across swamp waterways.

Its colour is caused by the decaying vegetation. As vegetation decays, tannins leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, looking like tea or coffee. \nMost rivers in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States are blackwater rivers. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black soil, are black due to the color of the soil. These rivers are \"black mud rivers\" or estuaries.\nBlackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ both from whitewater and clearwater rivers. \nThe classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853."}

A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19\u201320 days.\nIt gives a loud call known as yaffling.\nOld deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns."}

They are also known as 'indicator birds', or 'honey birds'.\nThey have an Old World tropical distribution, with most species in Africa and two in Asia. These birds are known for their interaction with humans. One or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind.\nBrooding.\nThe breeding behavior of eight species in \"Indicator\" and \"Prodotiscus\" is known. They are all brood parasites that lay an egg in a nest of another species. Most prefer hole-nesting species, often the related barbets and woodpeckers, but \"Prodotiscus\" parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host's chicks from the nest. They have hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts' eggs or kill the nestlings.\nAfrican honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host."}

The best-known example is the cuckoo. Brood parasitism works because the parasite develops faster than the resident eggs, kills its nestmates and turfs them out of the nest. The adult birds cannot tell the difference in the young, and spend their time raising the offspring of another species. In some cases, the parasite has the ability to make the begging cheeps of the host species.\nThe strength of defences and counter-adaptation rely on the species' ability to evolve. Some host species have very strong rejection defences. This makes the parasitic species evolving to have very close mimicry. But in other species, hosts do not reject the foreign egg. As a result, the parasitic species shows no egg mimicry.\nSimilar methods are used by some fish and insects."}

A famous \"Madonna and Child\" by Coppo di Marcovaldo stood above the altar where Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi painted the walls of the Brancacci Chapel. Giotto, who is thought of as the first Renaissance painter, was educated by Cimabue, one of the great masters of the Late Byzantine style.\nItalian Proto-Renaissance.\nProto-Renaissance artists worked before 1400 in Italy when the Renaissance style was slowly developing. \nInternational Gothic.\nArtists from many parts of Europe worked in a decorative Gothic style.

The crash of Pan Am Flight 103 and several other factors led to the airline to stop flying in 1991.\nHistory.\nPan Am was founded in 1926. Its first flights were from Key West, Florida to Havana, Cuba. During the 1920s and 1930s, Pan Am bought several smaller airlines in Central America and South America. These were bought to help Pan Am expand its flights throughout The Americas. Pan Am became the first airline to circumnavigate the world in 1942. By the 1950s, Pan Am had several larger airplanes like the Boeing 377, Douglas DC-6 and the Lockheed Constellation. It went to cities all across the world. In 1959, Pan Am bought its first jet - the Boeing 707. In 1970, Pan Am introduced its first widebody jet - the Boeing 747.\nIn 1980, Pan Am was combined with National Airlines. This was because Pan Am wanted to fly domestic flights and the government didn't allow it. When Pan Am bought National, it could finally fly domestically. In the 1980s, Pan Am started having many financial problems, having paid too much to buy National Airlines. Pan Am also spent too much money on the new Boeing 747s. The Gulf War of 1990 also caused many problems with Pan Am's transatlantic flights. Pan Am declared bankruptcy in January 1991. Delta Air Lines bought small parts of Pan Am and tried to help it. However, on December 4, 1991 Pan Am stopped flying due to the big financial problems. United Airlines got many of Pan Am's old flights. American Airlines got Pan Am's Miami hub. Pan Am was resurrected twice in 1996 and 1998."}

It was after the Cheka and before the NKVD. Its official name was the Joint State Political Directorate. \nThe OGPU was theoretically supposed to operate with more restraint than the original Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. The OGPU's powers were greatly increased in 1926, when the Soviet criminal code was amended to include a section on \"anti-state terrorism\". The law were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted. Even before then, it set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of terrorism, usually without calling any witnesses. In time, the OGPU's powers grew even greater than those of the Cheka.\nPerhaps its most spectacular success was the Trust Operation of 1924\u20131925. OGPU agents contacted \u00e9migr\u00e9s in western Europe and pretended to be on a large group working to overthrow the communist regime, known as the \"Trust\". Exiled Russians gave the Trust large sums of money and supplies, as did foreign intelligence agencies. The Trust finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anti-Communist operators, Sidney Reilly, into Russia to meet with the Trust. Once he was in Russia, he was captured and killed. It was a great propaganda success.\nFrom 1927 to 1929, the OGPU engaged in intensive investigations of an opposition coup. Stalin soon made a public decree that any and all opposition views should be considered dangerous and gave the GPU the authority to seek out hostile elements. There were many trials during Stalin's Five Year Plan. \nThe OGPU was responsible for the creation of the Gulag system. It also became the Soviet government's arm for the persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Greek Catholics, the Latin Catholics, Islam and other religious organizations. The OGPU was also the main secret police agency for the detection, arrest, and liquidation of anarchists and other dissident left-wing factions in the early Soviet Union.\nThe OGPU was merged into the newly created all-union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in July 1934. Its last change was into the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB)."}

It shows why two \"rational\" individuals might not co-operate, even if it seems in their best interests. It is studied in game theory.\nGame structure.\nSetup.\nThe police catch two criminals after they committed a crime. The police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped. They question the two in separate cells. Each prisoner can either stay silent or betray (hurt) the other by blaming the crime on them. If both stay silent, they only go to jail for 6 months. If one betrays and the other stays silent, the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all. If they both betray each other, they each go to jail for 2 years. No matter what happens, the prisoners will never see each other again.\nStrategies.\nIf you are a prisoner in this situation and you care only about yourself, the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner. No matter what, you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not.\nIf the other prisoner stays silent and does not betray, then betraying means you do not go to jail at all instead of going to jail for 6 months.\nIf the other prisoner betrays, then betraying lets you go to jail for 2 years instead of 10 years. In other words, it's always best for you to betray, even though the two of you would be better off if you both stayed silent. Betraying the other prisoner is your \"dominant strategy\" because it is always the best thing for you to do, no matter what the other prisoner does.\nThe prisoner's dilemma does not have same result if some of the details are different.\nGame theory was much studied during the Cold War period. In that case the \"players\" being studied were the United States and the Soviet Union."}

Bede wrote about the poet and his work in the fourth book of his \"Historia\". \nC\u00e6dmon.\nBede told the story of C\u00e6dmon who was an illiterate cow-herder who was suddenly able to recite a Christian song of creation in Old English verse. This miracle happened after C\u00e6dmon left a feast when they were passing a harp around for all to sing a song. He left the hall after feeling ashamed that he could not contribute a song. Later in a dream he said a man appeared to him and asked him to sing a song. C\u00e6dmon responded that he could not sing. But the man told him that he could and asked him to \u201cSing to me the beginning of all things.\u201d C\u00e6dmon was then able to sing verses and words that he had not heard of before. C\u00e6dmon then reported his experience first to a steward then to Hild the abbess. She invited scholars to evaluate C\u00e6dmon\u2019s gift. C\u00e6dmon was sent home to turn more divine doctrine into song. The abbess was so impressed with the success of his gift that she told him to become a monk. C\u00e6dmon lived a long and very productive life as a monk. He created songs from all kinds of Church history and doctrine.\nChoral settings of Caedmon's Hymn.\nThe text has been set to music by a number of composers of choral music. Graham Keitch used Bede's translation for a motet which was commissioned to mark the 1100th anniversary of the death of the Anglo Saxon queen, Aethelflaed.

It was directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner. It was adapted by William Goldman from his 1973 novel of the same name. The story is presented in the movie as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). This kept the book's narrative style. This movie is number 50 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". It is number 88 on The American Film Institute's (AFI) \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions\" list of the 100 greatest film love stories. In the United States, \"The Princess Bride\" has become a cult movie.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.filmjerk.com/news/article.php?id_new=489\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well-loved by critics.\nPlot.\nA grandfather visits his grandson, who is sick and must stay at home. The grandfather reads him a story, and says it is full of fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, and miracles. The grandson does not believe it will be good but agrees to try and stay awake, and sometimes interrupts as his grandfather tells the story. \nA beautiful young woman named Buttercup lives on a farm, in a land called Florin. Whenever she tells the farmhand Westley to do some work, he always does the work and his only answer is \"As you wish.\" She eventually realizes that he truly means \"I love you\" and she realizes that she loves him too. He is poor and they do not have enough money to get married. He leaves to seek his fortune, but his ship is attacked by a famous pirate, the Dread Pirate Roberts, who is known for never taking prisoners, and Westley is believed dead.\nFive years later, Buttercup is forced to marriage Prince Humperdinck, the prince of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a short Sicilian boss named Vizzini, a giant from Greenland named Fezzik, and a Spanish fencing master named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who killed his father. Soon the outlaws are pursued by a masked man in black, and also by Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers. \nThe man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a sword fight and knocks him unconscious. He wrestles the giant Fezzik, and put him to sleep using a choke hold. He outsmarts Vizzini, tricking him into drinking from a cup containing poison. He takes Buttercup prisoner and they flee. They stop to rest near the top of steep hill. Buttercup guesses that he is the famous Dread Pirate Roberts, and is angry with him for killing Westley. Buttercup sees Humperdinck and his soldier in the distance and pushes Roberts down the hill and wishes death upon him. As he tumbles down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Buttercup realizes Westley was pretending to be the Dread Pirate Roberts, and she throws herself down the hill after him and they are reunited. Westley explains the Dread Pirate Roberts is not one person, but a name passed on when the pirate wants to retire. They must pass through the dangerous Fire Swamp, and avoid hungry animals that live there. They survive the fires and the rodents of unusual size (ROUS), but are captured as they leave by prince Humperdinck and his cruel assistant Count Rugen, who has six fingers on each hand. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release. Humperdinck secretly orders Rugen to lock Westley in his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair.\nWhen Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. His real plan all along had been to start war with the neighboring country of Guilder by making it look like they had killed Buttercup. Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite after Humperdinck orders the thieves arrested in the nearby forest, and Fezzik tells Inigo about Rugen. Inigo decides that they need Westley's help to get into the castle. Buttercup is sad and angry with Humperdinck when she learns that he has not tried to find Westley. Humperdinck locks Buttercup in her room, and tortures Westley to death. In the forest Inigo and Fezzik are able to hear Westley cry out in pain, as he dies. They find Westley's body and bring him to a folk healer, called Miracle Max. Max used to work for the king of Florin but was fired by Humperdinck, and at first says he cannot help but agrees because he does not like Humperdinck. He discovers that Westley is not dead but only \"mostly dead\" because of his true love for Buttercup. Max brings Westley back to life, but Westley cannot move his body, and needs more time to recover. \nAfter Westley, Inigo and Fezzik get inside the castle, Humperdinck is scared and tries to finish the wedding quickly. Inigo finds and Rugen the six-fingered man who killed his father. He fights him in a duel to the death, saying to him again and again: \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" Westley finds Buttercup, who was about to kill herself, and tells her the marriage was not real because she never said \"I do\". Still unable to move, he wastes time and tells Humperdinck all the terrible things he will do to him if they fight. His bluff works and without fighting Humperdinck gives up. Together the leave the castle, Westley rides away with Buttercup, and Inigo and Fezzik. Westley and Buttercup share a kiss. \nThe boy asks his grandfather to read the story to him again the next day, to which the grandfather replies, \"As you wish.\""}

There are three to five (or possibly many more) species. \nThese birds have mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.\nCrossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones. The unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They move (\"erupt\") out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months. This is the time to get the most cones.\nThey put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones. Then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart. This lets them get at the seed (usually two seeds per scale). The point is that, as cones mature, they tend to open when dry and close when wet.\nEventually they fall, and lie on the ground. As they dry the scales naturally open, and any animal can get at the seeds. With their beaks, crossbills can get at the seeds much earlier than any other animal.\nFood preferences.\nEach species' bill shape is optimised for opening seeds from different species of conifer. Their preferred food sources are:\nThe relationships between crossbill species has been much studied."}

The game is set 30 years after \"Five Nights at Freddy's\".\nThe player assumes the role of a newly hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed amusement park attraction that pays homage to the original Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems - cameras, audio, and ventilation - and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. They have to defend from Springtrap and the 'phantoms', which are more ghostly and burnt-looking versions of the animatronics from the previous games, including Golden Freddy, Chica, Withered Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and Phantom Puppet. These animatronics cannot physically hurt you, but every time they catch you, one of the systems then needs to be rebooted. While Phantom Mangle does not jumpscare directly, it can appear in the hall or on one of the cameras and emit a garbled static sound, causing the audio system to have to be rebooted. The only animatronic that can cause a game over is Sprintrap, the main antagonist, and he is attracted to sound. The only way to get him to not kill you is by playing audio of Balloon Boy laughing from \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2.\" If you play this audio on a camera close to Springtrap, Springtrap will go towards it. He is also attracted to Mangle's loud garbled audio sounds, so if Mangle is in the hallway making noise, he will go towards your office faster."}

Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera\".\nIn 1985, the movie was nominated for five Academy Awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, and Best Sound Presentation."}

{"id": "484317", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=484317", "title": "Chickasaw", "text": "The Chickasaw are a Native American people of the Southeastern Woodlands of North America. Before Europeans arrived, they lived in the Southeastern United States of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. They speak a Muskogean language and are federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation.\nAt first, the Chickasaw lived in western North America, but sometime before the first European contact, they moved to east of the Mississippi River. They settled mostly in present-day northeast Mississippi. They were living here when European explorers and traders came. They had relationships with the French, English and Spanish during the colonial years. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes, because they adopted numerous practices of European Americans. They were forced by the US to sell their land in 1832 and move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) during the 1830s.\nMost Chickasaw now live in Oklahoma. The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Its members are related to the Choctaw and share a common history with them. The Chickasaw are divided into two groups: the \"Impsaktea\" and the \"Intcutwalipa\". They traditionally followed a system of matrilineal descent. Some property was controlled by women, and hereditary leadership in the tribe passed from a mother to her children.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"chickasaw\" originally belonged to a Chickasaw leader. \"Chickasaw\" is the English spelling of \"Chikashsha\" (), meaning \"rebel\" or \"comes from Chicsa\".\nHistory.\nThe origin of the Chickasaw is not known for certain. Twentieth-century scholars, such as the archeologist Patricia Galloway, think that the Chickasaw and Choctaw came from the Plaquemine culture and other groups whose ancestors had lived in the Lower Mississippi Valley for thousands of years. The Chickasaw and Choctaw then became distinct peoples in the 17th century. When Europeans first encountered them, the Chickasaw were living in villages in present-day South Carolina and northeastern Mississippi.\nThe Chickasaw may have been migrants to the area. Their oral history says that they moved from west of the Mississippi River into present-day Mississippi in prehistoric times.\nAnother version of the Chickasaw creation story is that they came out of the ground at \"Nanih Waiya,\" a great mound built about 300 CE by Woodland peoples.\nIn 1540 the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto encountered the ancestors of the Chickasaw and stayed in one of their towns. After various disagreements, the American Indians attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying it. The Spanish moved on quickly.\nThe Chickasaw began to buy guns from the British after the colony of Carolina was founded in 1670. They used these weapons to raid the Choctaw. They captured some members and sold them into Indian slavery to the British. When the Choctaw started buying guns from the French, the slave raids stopped.\nAllied with the British, the Chickasaw had battles with the French and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the Battle of Ackia on May 26, 1736. They continued until France was defeated by the British in the Seven Years' War (called the French and Indian War in North America).\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the Chickasaw were allies of the new United States and fought against the Indians of the old Northwest Territory. The Shawnee and other Northwest Indians were defeated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.\nRelations with the United States.\nGeorge Washington (first U.S. President) and Henry Knox (first U.S. Secretary of War) proposed the cultural transformation of Native Americans. Washington believed that Native Americans were equals of white people, but that their society was not as good. He came up with a policy to \"civilize\" them, and Thomas Jefferson continued it. Washington's plan included impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; and punishing those who violated Indian rights.\nThe government appointed Indian agents. They lived among the Indians to teach them how to live like whites. In the 19th century, the Chickasaw increasingly adopted European-American practices, as they established schools, adopted yeoman farming practices, converted to Christianity, and built homes in styles like their European-American neighbors.\nTreaty of Hopewell (1786).\nThe Chickasaw signed the Treaty of Hopewell in 1786. This treaty officially recognized peace between the Chickasaw and the United States.\nTreaty of 1818.\nIn 1818, the leaders of the Chickasaw signed a treaty giving up all land north of the southern border of Tennessee. The Chickasaw kept a four-square-mile reservation, but were required to lease the land to European immigrants.\nRemoval era (1837).\nThe Chickasaw received $3 million U.S. dollars from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. Other tribes who received land grants in exchange for ceding territory.\nIn 1836, the Chickasaw agreed to purchase land in Indian Territory from the Choctaw. They paid the Choctaw $530,000 for the western part of their land. For nearly 30 years, the US did not pay the Chickasaw the $3 million it owed them for their territory in the Southeast.\nThe Chickasaw gathered at Memphis, Tennessee, on July 4, 1837, with all of their portable assets: belongings, livestock, and enslaved African Americans. Three thousand and one Chickasaw crossed the Mississippi River. During the journey, often called the Trail of Tears by all the Southeast tribes that had to make it, more than 500 Chickasaw died of dysentery and smallpox.\nWhen the Chickasaw reached Indian Territory, the United States merged them with the Choctaw nation. The Chickasaw wrote their own constitution in the 1850s.\nAmerican Civil War (1861).\nThe Chickasaw Nation became allies of the Confederate States of America in 1861. They did this because the United States government had forced them off their lands and did not protect them against the Plains tribes in the West. Confederate officials suggested that the American Indian tribes would receive an independent Indian state if the Confederacy won.\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was made the Confederate envoy to Native Americans. He negotiated several treaties, including the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws in July 1861. The treaty covered many things, such as the sovereignty of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nation, the possibility of citizenship in the Confederate States of America, and a delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. Because the Chickasaw sided with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, they had to give up some of their land after the war. The US also freed all the slaves owned by the Chickasaw. Members of the Chickasaw who returned to the United States were given US citizenship.\nPost\u2013Civil War.\nBecause the Chickasaw were on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War, the United States government made a new peace treaty with them in 1866. It required that they free their slaves and give citizenship to freed slaves who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation. The freed slaves and their descendants became known as the Chickasaw Freedmen. However, the Chickasaw Nation did not give citizenship to the Chickasaw Freedmen. Descendants of the Freedmen continue to live in Oklahoma.\nThe Chaloklowa Chickasaw Indian People were recognized as a \"state-recognized group\" by South Carolina in 2005. Their headquarters is in Hemingway, South Carolina. In 2003, they asked the US Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs for federal recognition, but they did not receive it.\nGovernment.\nIn the twentieth century, the Chickasaw became independent from the Choctaw and re-established their government. They are now federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation. The tribe's government is headquartered in Ada, Oklahoma.\nCulture.\nChiefs have the suffix \"-mingo\" at the end of their names. For example, \"Tishomingo\" was the name of a famous Chickasaw chief.\nIn 2010, the tribe opened the Chickasaw Cultural Center in Sulphur, Oklahoma."}

Since 1958 it has been the seat of the French Senate of the Fifth Republic.\nBrief history.\nThe palace was originally built in 1612 by Marie de' Medici on lands she owned. The design was based on buildings from her native Florence. The building is often compared to the far larger Palazzo Pitti where Queen Marie was born in 1575. In 1642, Marie left the Luxembourg to her second and favourite son, Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. He called it the \"Palais d'Orl\u00e9ans\" but it was still known by its original name. Upon Gaston's death, the palace passed to his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine. Then it passed to his elder daughter by his first marriage, La Grande Mademoiselle. \nIn 1660, Anne de Montpensier sold the Luxembourg to her younger half-sister, \u00c9lisabeth Marguerite d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Guise. The Duchess, in turn, gave it to her cousin, king Louis XIV, in 1694. In 1717 Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, Regent of France gave the palace to his favourite daughter the Duchess of Berry. The building became infamous for the duchess's parties and sexual activities. She also hosted Peter the great there in 1717. The pregnancies of the young widow make scandal. At the end of March 1719, a new confinement badly prepared by her excesses, goes very badly. On the verge of death, she begs for extreme unction, which the church refuses her. On April 2, she is delivered of a stillborn child. Disgraced by the rumors of this birth, which all Paris talks about, the princess does not recover and dies in July at the castle of La Muette. At the autopsy, the doctors find her pregnant once again.\nSometime after the French Revolution it became a prison. During World War II it was a headquarters for the Luftwaffe.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

She is known internationally because she represents journalists and because she speaks to support press freedom. In 2008, \"The New York Times\" said she was \"Zimbabwe's top human rights lawyer\". In 2014, she received an International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State.\nLegal practice.\nMtetwa received her LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree from the University of Botswana and Swaziland in 1981. She spent the next two years working in Swaziland as a prosecuting attorney (a lawyer who is responsible for starting legal cases against people accused of crimes). In 1983, she moved to Zimbabwe. There she worked as a prosecutor until 1989. That year, she went into private practice (a professional business that is not controlled or paid for by the government). She began to limit her business to one subject, the practice of human rights law. In one of her more famous cases, she questioned a section of Zimbabwe's law, the Private Voluntary Organizations Act. She won the case. The law allowed the government to change the group of people who manage or direct non-governmental organizations. She also questioned the results of 37 districts in the parliamentary elections. In a PBS documentary, Mtetwa said the reason for her activism is \"not because there is any glory or cash to it and not because I'm trying to antagonize the government... I'm doing it because it's a job that's got to be done\".\nMtetwa is especially famous because she defends local and international journalists. In 2003, for example, she got a court order, a formal statement from a court to stop the government from forcing \"Guardian\" reporter Andrew Meldrum to leave the country. She gave the order to security officials at Harare International Airport only minutes before Meldrum's plane left. She also helped reporters Toby Harnden and Julian Simmonds from London's \"Sunday Telegraph\" newspaper. They were arrested during the Zimbabwean April parliamentary election. The government said the reporters did not have official approval. The court said they were not guilty. In April 2008, she helped \"New York Times\" reporter Barry Bearak get out of jail. He was arrested for similar reasons. Mtetwa also defended many local journalists who were in jail before the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election.\nAssaults and threats.\nIn 2003, police arrested Mtetwa. They said it was for drunk driving. At the police station, they hit her and choked her, or tried to stop her breathing by squeezing her throat. Three hours later, the police let her go, without a formal charge or accusation. For two days after the attack, she could not speak. On the third day, she returned with a folder of medical evidence, and she filed charges against the police officers. Police officers reportedly attacked Mtetwa again in 2007. Police beat Mtetwa and three colleagues, people who work with her, with rubber nightsticks during a protest march. The march was to protest the harassment of Zimbabwe's lawyers.\nIn an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mtetwa said how she tries to prevent attacks:\n\"I think I confront the danger immediately before it happens. I always make sure that if, for instance, I'm called in the middle of the night to a scene that is potentially dangerous, I make sure that there are as many media practitioners as possible, particularly to record what will happen there. And in the glare of cameras I find that people don't want to do what they would want to do. So in a lot of ways I think I've been lucky, and I haven't received as much harassment as one would have expected, or as much as other human rights defenders have had.\"\nInternational recognition.\nIn 2005, Mtetwa won the of the Committee to Protect Journalists. The award citation said that \"in a country where the law is used as a weapon against independent journalists, Mtetwa has defended journalists and argued for press freedom, all at great personal risk.\" In 2008, she also won the group's Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement.\nMtetwa received several awards from legal organizations. In 2009, the European Bar Human Rights Institute gave her the Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize (\"The award given by lawyers to a lawyer\"). That award is given each year to a lawyer who, throughout his or her career, has illustrated, by activity or suffering, the defence of human rights in the world. Mtetwa won the 2010 International Human Rights award of the American Bar Association. In 2011, she received the Inamori Ethics Prize from Case Western Reserve University in the US. In 2014, she received the International Women of Courage Award.\nSt. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada, was the first university to celebrate Mtetwa's many achievements. They gave her an honorary degree in 2013."}

She is most famous for writing \"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\" and \"I Capture the Castle\", both adapted into famous films. Ms Smith had not intended to be a writer. Her first love was acting but, she once admitted, \"I simply wasn't very good.\"\nEarly life.\nSmith was born on May 3, 1896 in Whitefield, UK. When she was eighteen years old, her father died, so after that she and her mother lived with her family - her grandparents, three uncles and two aunts, in an old house with a garden leaning towards the Manchester Ship Canal. Both her mother and grandmother wrote and composed. Almost everyone in the household sang and played an instrument (including pianos, a violin, a mandolin, a guitar and a banjo) and one uncle, a nonprofessional but decent actor, was usually rehearsing, preferably with Smith there to give him cues. Although she had liked theater for a while before she could read, it was hearing of her uncle's parts which really sparked her passion for acting and writing plays, especially as the cues she gave to her uncle got longer and longer and, by the age of nine, Smith had written a forty-page play.\nEarly career.\nEven when her mother described her first play as dull and boring, she did not stop trying to succeed. Soon she became a young actress for many theaters after studying at the London\u2019s Royal Academy of Art. During World War I, Smith went to France to help amuse the soldiers there and also appeared in a performance of John Galsworthy's Pigeon. In 1923, the actress left the theater to work as a buyer for Heal and Son, a furniture company where she remained for the next eight years, writing for the stage in cinema in her free time. Smith first gained recognition as a playwright, going by the name of C. L. Anthony until 1935. In 1931, Smith sold her play Autumn Crocus to one of her old stage directors. Although she had written a screenplay and a stage play before, Autumn Crocus proved to be the work that turned her career around. Call It a Day was the first play Smith wrote under her own name; also proving to be her most financially rewarding piece. Her plays, generally simple comedies about middle-class life, received much praise, both popular and critical. \"The ability to recreate detail, to capture the nuances of everyday conversation, to recognize humor in the trivialities of middle-class life marks the dramas of Dodie Smith,\" wrote Martha Hadsel. \"Her critics sometimes found fault with what they considered her superficiality, but most admitted that her plays provided enjoyable entertainment.\" Hadsel claimed Smith to be \"one of the few successful women dramatists in England and America during the first half of the twentieth century.\"\nWorks of Dodie Smith.\nChildren\u2019s books:\n- The Hundred and One Dalmatians, 1956.\n- The Starlight Barking, 1968.\n- The Midnight Kittens, 1978.\nPlays: \n- Call It a Day, 1937.\n- Bonnet over the Windmill, 1937.\n- (And co-director) Dear Octopus, 1939.\n- Autumn Crocus, Service, and Touch Wood, 1939.\n- Lovers and Friends, 1944.\n- Letter from Paris, 1954.\n- I Capture the Castle, 1948.\n- These People, Those Books, 1958.\n- Amateur Means Lover, 1962.\nNovels:\n- I Capture the Castle, 1999.\n- The New Moon with the Old, 1963.\n- The Town in Bloom, 1965.\n- It Ends with Revelations, 1967.\n- A Tale of Two Families, 1970.\n- The Girl from the Candle-lit Bath, 1978.\nAutobiographies:\n- Look Back with Love: A Manchester Childhood, 1974.\n- Look Back with Mixed Feelings, 1978.\n- Look Back with Astonishment, 1979.\n- Look Back with Gratitude, 1985.\nScreenplays: \n- (With Frank Partos) The Uninvited (adapted from the novel by Dorothy Macardle), Paramount, 1944.\n- (With Lesser Samuels) Darling, How Could You!

Since she was a child, she had a dream of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant.\nTwo female helicopter pilots during the Soviet era, along with her father, served as inspiration for Rahmani's achievement.

Women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers; however, Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers upon landing in one mission.

At the rally, Hefazat-e-Islam activists attacked Sharmeen. The reason for the rally was to demand laws to limit or control the mixing of men and women in the same space, punish atheists, require women to wear headscarves, and other religion-based rules.

Ensler wrote the play \"The Vagina Monologues\"). She started the organization V-Day. The idea for the organization came from the Todd Akin 'legitimate rape' and pregnancy comment controversy. Ensler was shocked at Akin's statement.

There were tens of thousands of events.\nBy September 20, 2012, people from 160 countries had signed up to take part in the campaign.\nAround 5,000 organizations joined the campaign. The campaign was supported by religious ministers, movement builders, actors Rosario Dawson and Robert Redford, and Stella Creasy, a British Labour Co-operative politician.\nAnoushka Shankar, a classical musician from India, made a video message dedicated to Jyoti Singh. Singh was the Indian student who died in December after she was gang-raped by six men on a Delhi bus. In the video, Shankar said she was abused by a trusted friend of her parents over several years when she was a child. In her message she said she did not believe she will ever recover from the abuse she had suffered: \"...as a woman I find I'm frequently living in fear, afraid to walk along at night, afraid to answer a man who asks for the time, afraid I'm going to be judged or treated in ways based on the way I might choose to dress or the make up I might choose to wear, and you know, enough is enough. I'm rising for women like Jyoti, for women like her, with the amazing women of my country I'm rising for the child in me who I don't think will ever fully recover from what happened to her.\"\n2013.\nOn February 14, 2013, there were rallies in more than 190 countries. The one-day event happened after a call for one billion women around the world to join together to dance in a show of group strength.

The word \"billion\" refers the number that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime, or about one billion. \n2014.\nOne Billion Rising for Justice was in February 2014.

All 34 provinces of Afghanistan planned events.\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, famous Critical Race Theory figure and professor at UCLA School of Law and Columbia Law School, supported One Billion Rising to help create awareness of the difficulties girls of color face in New York and Boston schools. These issues include the school-to-prison pipeline, stereotyping, and the difference in suspension reasons and numbers compared to white girls (the rates being 10 times higher than for white girls).

{"id": "497755", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497755", "title": "Forgiveness", "text": "Forgiveness is the choice that a person makes to forgive another person for an offense or something that is illegal or immoral. Forgiveness is intentional and voluntary. When someone forgives someone else, they let go of negative emotions, for example vengefulness. They wish their offender well.\nIntroduction.\nForgiveness is a mental or spiritual process. It means no longer feeling angry at another person, or at yourself. This could be because of a crime, a sin, an offense, an insult, a difference, an error, a mistake, or a failure.\nForgiveness does not require punishment or restitution. It is given without any expectation of compensation. Forgiveness may involve offering an apology.\nForgiveness involves the feelings of the person who forgives and their relationship with the person being forgiven. Forgiveness can occur without the person being forgiven ever knowing about it. For example, a person can forgive another person who is dead or who is not seen for a long time.\nForgiveness means forgetting offenses. It is sincere and genuine. It does not impose humiliating conditions. It is not motivated by pride. True forgiveness is known by deeds and not by words.\n said, \"The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\"\nReligious views of forgiveness.\nMost world religions include teachings about forgiveness. These teachings form the basis of modern traditions and practices of forgiveness.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism, if a person causes harm, he or she must go to those he or she has harmed and ask for forgiveness. If he or she sincerely and honestly apologizes to the person who he or she has harmed and tries to rectify the wrong, the wronged person must forgive him or her. \n\"[J]ust as I forgive everyone, so may You grant me grace in the eyes of others, that they too forgive me absolutely.\" \u2014Tefila Zaka\nEach year, Jews observe Yom Kippur, or a Day of Atonement. Before Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the past year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the sins they have made against God in the past year. God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God. This is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek forgiveness from those people who they have wronged.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, Jesus spoke of the importance of forgiving others, or showing mercy. In the New Testament, there are several examples. \n\u201cBlessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.\u201d \u2014Matthew 5:7 (NIV) \n\u201cBut I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.\u201d \u2014Luke 6:27-29 (NIV) \n\u201cBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\u201d \u2014Luke 6:36 (NIV) \n\u201cDo not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.\u201d \u2014Luke 6:37 (NIV)\nJesus used the (Matthew 18:21-35) to say that we should forgive without limits. The Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.\nIslam.\nIslam teaches that Allah is \"Al-Ghaffur\" (\"The Oft-Forgiving\") and that Allah is the original source of all forgiveness (\"ghufran\" \u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646). Seeking forgiveness from Allah with repentance is a virtue.\nThere are numerous verses in the Qur'an and the Hadiths that recommend forgiveness. \n\"Allah forgives what is past.\" \u2014Qur'an 5:95\nIslam recommends forgiveness between believers, because Allah values forgiveness. However, Islam also allows revenge, to the extent of the harm that was done. \n\"The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto: but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for Allah loveth not those who do wrong.\" \u2014Qur'an 42:40\nForgiveness between believers is encouraged, with a promise of reward from Allah.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, explains how to be forgiving towards others.\n\"Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness.\" \u2014`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, \"The Promulgation of Universal Peace\", p. 92\nThe writings of Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, state that you should \"forgive and forget\" a person's actions against you, so that you will be forgiven.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, forgiveness prevents harmful thoughts from damaging a person\u2019s mental well-being. Buddhism recognizes that feelings of hatred have a lasting effect on karma. Buddhism encourages thoughts that have a positive effect. \n\"In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing mett\u0101 and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all.\" \nWhen there is resentment, the Buddhist practice is to calmly release them. Buddhism focuses on release from suffering through meditation.\nBuddhism questions the emotions that make forgiveness necessary. \n\"If we haven\u2019t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers.\"\nBuddhism emphasizes \"mett\u0101\" (loving kindness), \"karu\u1e47\u0101\" (compassion), \"mudita\" (joy), and \"upekkh\u0101\" (equanimity), as ways to avoid resentments in the first place. These ideas help to understand suffering in the world, both our own suffering and the suffering of others.\nHinduism.\nForgiveness is one of the six cardinal virtues of Hinduism. A person who does not forgive carries baggage of bad memories, negative feelings, and unresolved emotions that affect the present as well as the future. In Hinduism, one must forgive others, and one must also seek forgiveness for wronging someone else.\nHindu epics and ancient literature also discuss forgiveness. For example:\n\"Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is the Vedas; forgiveness is the Shruti; ... forgiveness is holiness; and by forgiveness ... the universe is held together.\" \u2014Mahabharata, Book 3, Vana Parva, Section XXIX\n\"Righteousness is the one highest good, forgiveness is the one supreme peace, knowledge is one supreme contentment, and benevolence, one sole happiness.\" \u2014Mahabharata, Book 5, Udyoga Parva, Section XXXIII\nIn Hinduism, you seek forgiveness from those you have wronged, and from society at large through charity, purification, fasting, rituals, and meditation. Forgiveness in Hinduism does not require that a person make peace with their offender and it does not rule out reconciliation in some situations. Forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (\"dharmic\" life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one\u2019s personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (\"akrodhi\").\nJainism.\nIn Jainism, forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be acquired by the Jains. Forgiveness (or \"k\u1e63am\u0101pan\u0101\") forms part of one of the ten characteristics of \"dharma\". Jain texts quote M\u0101hav\u012bra on forgiveness:\nBy practicing \"pr\u0101ya\u1e63citta\" (repentance), a soul gets rid of sins, and commits no transgressions; he who correctly practises \"pr\u0101ya\u1e63citta\" gains the road and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.\u2014 M\u0101hav\u012bra in \"Uttar\u0101dhyayana S\u016btra\" 29:17\u201318\nIn the Jain prayer \"pratikramana\", Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures \u2014 even from beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and working.\nI ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me.\nMay I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.\nIn their daily prayers, Jains seek forgiveness from all creatures:\nI seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they \u2014 one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.\nForgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, \"Micch\u0101mi dukka\u1e0da\u1e43.\" This phrase means, \"May all the evil that has been done be fruitless.\" On \"\", Jains greet their friends and relatives saying \"micch\u0101mi dukka\u1e0da\u1e43\" and seeking their forgiveness. Letters are sent and telephone calls are made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness. There are no arguments or disputes after \"samvatsari\"."}

In the Second Battle of El Alamein British Commonwealth forces under the command of Lieutenant general Bernard Montgomery decisive defeated the Afrika Korps and other Axis forces and pushed them back to Tunisia. \nThe late 1942 Allied landings in Operation Torch in North-West Africa was done to mop up the remaining enemy forces. There were battles against Vichy France forces which then changed sides. The Allies suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Later, they defeated the Axis forces in southern Tunisia (battle of Mareth), then encircled the remaining Italian &amp; German troops in northern Tunisia and finally forced them to surrender. \nAfter the fall of Tunis, the last troops to surrender were the Italians of general Messe in May 13, 1943 in the northern Tunisian peninsula of Cape Bon."}

They were Robert B. Sherman (December 19, 1925 \u2013 March 6, 2012) and Richard M. Sherman (born June 12, 1928).\nThe Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in movie history. Movie scores of the Sherman Brothers include \"Mary Poppins\", \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", \"The Jungle Book\", \"Charlotte's Web\" and \"The Aristocats\".\nLife and work.\nSons of Russian Jewish immigrants, Robert and Richard Sherman began writing songs together in 1951 on a challenge from their father, Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman. The brothers wrote together and with different songwriting partners throughout the rest of the decade.\nIn 1958 Robert founded the music publishing company Music World Corporation. It later had a relationship with Disney's BMI-affiliated publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first top-ten hit with \"Tall Paul,\" sung by Mouseketeer Judy Harriet on the Surf Records label. It was also sung by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. The success of this song got the attention of Walt Disney. He then hired the Sherman Brothers as Staff Songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. The first song they wrote on personal assignment by Walt Disney was \"Strummin' Song\" in 1961. It was used in the Annette Funicello made-for-television movie called \"The Horsemasters\".\nWhile at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical scores than any other songwriters in the history of movies. They also wrote what is perhaps their best-known song, \"it's a small world (after all)\" for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Since then, some have claimed that this has become the most translated and performed song on Earth, although this is largely due to the fact that it is played at Disney's theme park \"it's a small world\" attractions of the same name.\nIn 1965 the Sherman Brothers won two Academy Awards for \"Mary Poppins\", which includes the songs \"Feed The Birds,\" \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" and the Oscar-winning \"Chim Chim Cher-ee.\" Since \"Mary Poppins\"' first was shown, the Shermans have earned nine Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards, four Grammy Award nominations, and 23 gold- and platinum-certified albums.\nRobert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney, completing the scores for the live-action musical movies \"The Happiest Millionaire\" and \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\" until Disney's death in 1966. Since leaving the company, the brothers have worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme-park exhibits, and stage musicals.\nTheir first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli's motion picture production \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" for United Artists in 1968. It got the brothers their third Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for its particularly memorable titular song.\nIn 1970, the Shermans returned to Disney for a brief stint where they completed work on \"The Aristocats\" and \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\". The latter movie got the brothers their fourth and fifth Oscar nominations. 1972 saw the release of \"Snoopy Come Home\", for which the brothers received a Grammy nomination.\nIn 1973 the Sherman Brothers also made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for \"Tom Sawyer\", for which they also authored the screenplay.\nIn 1976 \u201cThe Slipper and the Rose\u201d was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year. The performance was attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. A modern musical version of the classic Cinderella story, \"Slipper\", also featured songs, score, and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. Two further Academy Award nominations were gotten by the brothers for the movie. That same year the Sherman Brothers got their star on the Hollywood \"Walk of Fame\" directly across from Grauman's Chinese Theater.\nThe Sherman Brothers' many other Disney and non-Disney top box office movie credits include \"The Jungle Book\" (1967), \"The Aristocats\" (1970), \"The Parent Trap\" (1961), \"The Parent Trap\" (1998), \"Charlotte's Web\" (1973), \"Huckleberry Finn\" (1974),\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" (1977), \"Snoopy, Come Home\" (1972), \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" (1971), and \"\" (1989).\nOutside motion-pictures, their Tony Award-nominated smash hit \"Over Here!\" (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway musical of that year. The Sherman Brothers have also written numerous top selling songs including \"You're Sixteen,\" which reached Billboard's Hot 100 top 10 twice: first with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and then at #1 with Ringo Starr more than thirteen years later. Other top-ten hits include \"Pineapple Princess,\" \"Let's Get Together,\" and more.\nIn 2000 the Sherman Brothers wrote the song score for the Disney movie \"The Tigger Movie\". This movie marked the brothers' first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years.\nIn 2003, four Sherman Brothers' musicals ranked in the Top 10 Favorite Children's Films of All Time in a British nationwide poll reported by the BBC. Most notably, \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" 1968 topped the list at #1.\nIn later years, with Robert's move to London, the brothers wrote many new songs for the stage musical presentations of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" and \"Mary Poppins\", produced by Disney and Cameron Mackintosh.\nFor their contributions to the motion picture industry, the Sherman brothers have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Blvd. They were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 9, 2005. On November 16, 2006, \"Mary Poppins\" premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway.\nOn November 17, 2008 the Sherman Brothers got the National Medal of Arts which is the highest honor given to artists by the United States Government. The award was presented by United States President George W. Bush in an East Room ceremony at The White House.\nOn May 22, 2009, \"The Boys: the Sherman Brothers\u2019 Story\", a movie about the pair, was shown in theatres. The movie was directed and produced by their sons, Gregory V. Sherman and Jeff Sherman. It was put out by Walt Disney Pictures.\nIn October 2009, Disney released a 59 track, two CD compendium of their work for the studio spanning forty-two years. The CD is titled \"The Sherman Brothers Songbook\".\nOn March 11, 2010 the Sherman Brothers were presented with a Window on Mainstreet Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in honor of their contribution to Disney theme parks. On May 17, 2010, the Sherman Brothers received the \"Career Achievement Award\" at The Theatre Museum's 2010 Awards Gala in New York City.\nCollaboration from afar.\nFrom 2002, Robert Sherman lived in London, England.

{"id": "497833", "revid": "7809296", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497833", "title": "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "text": "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a 1968 British fantasy musical film, loosely based on Ian Fleming's novel \"Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car\". The movie's script is by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes. The songs are by the Sherman Brothers. The song \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" was nominated for an Academy Award.\nThe film stars Dick Van Dyke as Caractacus Potts, Sally Ann Howes as Truly Scrumptious, Lionel Jeffries as Grandpa Potts, James Robertson Justice as Lord Scrumptious and Robert Helpmann as the Childcatcher. The film was directed by Ken Hughes. It was produced by Albert R. Broccoli (co-producer of the James Bond series of films, also based on Fleming's novels). John Stears supervised the special effects. Irwin Kostal supervised and conducted the music. The musical numbers were staged by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.\nBaron Bomburst is the main antagonist in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He is a cruel king and a pirate who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the enchanted car. In spite of being so cruel and tyrannical, it is clear that he is also incredibly childish, as shown by his selfish love of toys, his whiny nature, and his determination to get everything he wants. Incidentally, the book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was written by James Bond's creator Ian Fleming, and both films were produced by Albert R . Broccoli.\nHe was portrayed by the late Gert Fr\u00f6be, who also played the titular villain Auric Goldfinger of the James Bond film.\nBaroness Bomburst is a supporting antagonist and hero in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and later the stage musical adaptation. The character was created by screenwriter Roald Dahl and did not appear in the original Ian Fleming novel.\nIn the 1968 film, she is played by Anna Quayle In the theatrical version in London, she was played by Nichola McAuliffe, Sandra Dickinson, and Louise Gold amongst others, and on Broadway, she was played by Jan Maxwell. On the UK National tour, she has been played by (amongst others) Louise Plowright, Jane Gurnett, Kim Ismay, Tamsin Carroll, Michelle Collins, and Claire Sweeney.\nHistory.\nFirst appearing as a gentleman pirate when the Potts and Truly Scrumptious are picnicking on the beach, he reveals a cruel and greedy streak by attempting to steal the enchanted car, and then he orders his men to load cannons, and when The Car floats he wants it even more. But the car escapes much to his disappointment, and seeing that the car is able to float and move like a speedboat on the sea, he sabotages the Potts' home by air and kidnaps Grandfather Potts, mistaking him for the inventor of Chitty.\nLater, when the Potts follow Bomburst's airship to his native Vulgaria, they discover how cruelly the Baron treats his subjects. Although it is stated that \"the Baroness hates children\" and that it is the Baroness who sends for the Child Catcher, it's obvious that the Baron himself hates children as well, and his greed is evident all the more when it is revealed that all the toys made by Vulgaria's toymaker are for him.\nBaron Bomburst is last seen when a huge battle occurs in his castle by an ambush lead by Caractacus Potts, Bomburst's loyal servant The Toymaker, the children of the villagers, and Truly Scrumptious. He and his wife cowardly hide from the battle and see lots of children ambush his castle. Wondering where the children are coming from the Bomburst couple summons the Child Catcher but even the Child Catcher is ultimately defeated by the Children and is left hanging from a net in the air. Realizing the Child Catcher is defeated Baroness suggests escaping down a slide. Baron Bomburst at first doesn't like the idea, due to not wanting to get his clothes dirty, but the couple goes down anyway and gets trapped in the Child Catcher's cage-car and the Bomburst couple is defeated. The Villagers help battle the Cavalry and Bomburst gets defeated in the battle. With the Baron and Baroness defeated the Cavalry retreats the battle in terror. Though Vulgaria then becomes a free country, it is completely unknown what happened to the Bomburst couple afterward, but as they did not execute any kid, it is highly likely that they were not executed for their crimes and were either exiled or sent to the very dungeons \nJeremy and Jeremiah Potts got captured by the child catcher, who was disguised as an ice cream man They, along with their father, the toymaker and Truly Scrumptious finally capturing the Child Catcher. Who later appears in the advert or sequel as a minor character who will later appear in the advert but they don't speak ready to take them back to the Baron Bomburst.\nCast.\nThe cast includes:\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film was the tenth most popular at the US box office in 1969.\nReviews.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert reviewed the film (\"Chicago Sun-Times\", 24 December 1968). He wrote: \"\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" contains about the best two-hour children's movie you could hope for, with a marvelous magical auto and lots of adventure and a nutty old grandpa and a mean Baron and some funny dances and a couple of [scary] moments.\"\nFilm critic and historian Leonard Maltin considered the picture \"one big Edsel. He said the movie had a totally forgettable score and some of the shoddiest special effects ever.\" In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Helpmann's depiction of the Child Catcher one of the \"50 Most Vile Movie Villains.\"\nAs of March 2014, the film has a 65% \"Fresh\" rating (17 of 26 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes.\nList of tracks:"}

Following its partial acquisition in 1998 by Emirates, it was re-branded and introduced the current livery. In 2008 the government of Sri Lanka acquired all the shares of the airline from Emirates. After ending the Emirates partnership, it retained its re-branded name and logo.

Emirates bought a 40% stake worth US$70 million (which it later increased to 43.6%) in Air Lanka and sought to refurbish the airline's image and fleet. The government retained a majority stake in the airline but gave full control to Emirates for investment and management decisions. In 1998, the Air Lanka re-branded to SriLankan Airlines.\nSriLankan acquired 6 to complement its fleet of and aircraft. The A330-200 aircraft joined the airline between October 1999 and July 2000.

He currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Nashville Predators and Philadelphia Flyers.\nCareer.\nBefore playing in the NHL, Timonen played parts of 7 years in the SM-liiga with KalPa, TPS, and HIFK.\nHe was drafted 250th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He continued to play in the SM-liiga after the draft. He helped Finland win the bronze medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. A little while after the Olympics, the Kings traded Timonen along with Jan Vopat to the Nashville Predators (who did not begin playing yet) in agreement that the Predators would not draft Garry Galley in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft.\nTimonen would spend time between the Predators and their IHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. He was called up to the Predators during 1999-2000 season. He played the next four seasons with the Predators before the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. He decided to travel back to Finland and play for KalPa during the lockout. On October 3, 2006, the Predators named Timonen the captain for the 2006\u201307 season.\nOn June 18, 2007, the Predators traded Timonen along with Scott Hartnell to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Philadelphia's first round pick (Jonathon Blum) in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. After he signed, he became the highest paid Finn in the NHL after he signed a six-year, $37.8 million contract extension.\nTimonen and the Flyers faced the Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. Philadelphia was able to win the series 4\u20133. In the second round of the playoffs, the Flyers played against the Montreal Canadiens and won the series 4\u20131. On April 30, 2008, Timonen was hit by a wrist shot at his foot by Canadiens defenseman Andrei Markov. He said that he had felt numbness in his foot but he didn't think it was anything but a twisted nerve. On May 8, 2008, a doctor at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who looked at Timonen's foot said that he had found a small blood clot. This stopped Timonen from playing indefinitely and he missed the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the rival Pittsburgh Penguins. He returned in game 5 but the Flyers lost and they were eliminated from the playoffs. On March 5, 2011, Timonen scored his 100th career goal against Ryan Miller of the Buffalo Sabres in a 5\u20133 loss. On August 5, 2014, Timonen was diagnosed with blood clots in his right leg and both of his lungs. He was ruled out from playing indefinitely and missed the first 62 games of the season.\nOn February 27, 2015, the Flyers traded Timonen to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a 2015 second-round pick and 2016 fourth-round pick."}

It is an infection of the female organs:\nSometimes the woman does not feel sick.\nThe signs of being sick with this sickness can be:\nIf this illness is not treated it can prevent a woman from having children. It can kill the unborn child and it can be very painful. This disease can be treated and the infection can be cured.\nSigns and symptoms.\nA woman with PID can feel sick. Sometimes a woman with PID does not feel sick. A woman with PID can have a fever, pain when the belly is touched, lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, painful sex, or unusual bleeding.\nCause.\nThe infection is caused by microorganisms that enter the body through the vagina during sex. The microorganisms travel up thorough uterus and into the inside of the body. There are many microorganisms that cause infection in this way, such as:\nDiagnosis.\nMedical workers use different tests to find the infection. They can perform a medical exam to see evidence of pus and find painful areas. They can use a microscope to see the microorganisms causing the infection. A blood test can detect PID. Two thirds of women were not aware they had PID. Even with no signs of infection, PID can cause serious harm.\nSimilar symptoms.\nOther causes can produce signs to PID symptoms including: appendicitis, a complicated pregnancy, swollen or twisted ovaries and endometriosis. A woman is more likely to get Pelvic inflammatory disease if she has had it before. She is more likely to have the infection if she has recently had sex, started menstruation, had an Intrauterine device put inside her uterus or if her sex partner has a sexually transmitted infection.\nPrevention.\nMedical testing for sexually transmitted infections is important for prevention. The risk of getting PID can be lowered by:\nTreatment.\nIf your medical provider thinks you are infected, treatment is usually started right away. This is because serious results may happen from delayed treatment. Sometimes the medical provider will use a test to help find the infection. Curing the infection with antibiotic medications is normal. Improvement should occur quickly but if not, the woman is told to find more medical attention. Treating sex partners for possible infections will help in treatment and prevention of getting the infection again.\nThe spread of the disease.\nAbout 106 million cases of PID occurred around the world in 2008. About 1.5% of young women yearly get the infection. One million women in the United States get PID every year.\nBeing cured.\nAlthough the PID infection may be cured the damage from the infection may not go away. This makes finding the infection early so important. Treatment by medical providers will prevent damage to the female reproductive organs."}

The NHS was especially at risk because it was using a version of the Windows operating system called Windows XP that Microsoft no longer supported. This meant that Microsoft had not been sending out security updates for this version of Windows, leaving it open to the WannaCry virus. Other systems were affected even though they were running newer versions of Windows, because their users had not yet installed the most recent security updates. Even though it was not designed to actually damage computers or their files, WannaCry led to a lot of wasted time and money, showing how vulnerable the world still is to ransomware attacks."}

The condition affects the brain and its cognitive function. The condition can be either chronic or acute. Paradoxically, sleep deprivation can be used to treat certain disorders, such as clinical depression. Sleep deprivation has also been used as a form of torture. Multiple factors can cause or contribute to sleep deprivation including poor sleep hygiene, lifestyle choices, work obligations, sleep disorders, and other medical conditions. Sleep deficiency may be caused by other sleep disorders or medical conditions. For example, sleep apnea, a breathing disorder that induces dozens of nightly awakenings, may hinder both sleep duration and quality. Other medical or mental health problems, such as pain or general anxiety disorder, can interfere with the quality and quantity of sleep.\nGenerally, sleep deprivation may result in:\nCauses.\nThere are many reasons why a person may not get enough sleep.

For this reason, errors do sometimes occur. Errors in perception are commonly called illusions. Emil Kraepelin used the term \"Erinnerungsverf\u00e4lschung\" (memory falsification) to speak about false memories.\nPerceptions need stimuli to be created. A perception without a stimulus is called hallucination. Much like the difference between illusion and hallucination, Kraepelin wanted to distinguish between a false memory and memories of something that did not really happen, which he called \"Erinnerkungsf\u00e4lschung\". Unfortunately, both German terms translate to the same English term.\nA false memory is a condition where a person remembers something that did not occur or where the memory does not closely match the occurrence. \nRemembering events that did not occur.\nUsing suggestion and hypnosis, it is possible to make people believe they experienced something, when they did not. Such phenomena also occur spontaneously, for example in a stressful situation, or when someone is not sleeping enough. \nLost in the mall.\nTo prove the existence of false memories, an experiment was conducted: People were given small stories of supposed relatives who told how these people were lost in a shopping mall, at age five or six, and how they had to be \"rescued\" by an adult. The experiment was done with 24 people. Afterwards, six people said that they remembered the event, even though it had never happened.\nMandela effect.\nFalse memories can sometimes be shared by multiple people. This is sometimes called the Mandela effect. Examples include memories of the Berenstain Bears' name being spelled \"Berenstein\", and of the existence of a 1990s movie entitled \"Shazaam\" starring comedian Sinbad as a genie.\nThe effect is named after South African anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela after people believed he died in prison in the 1980s (he actually died in 2013, after having served as President of South Africa from 1994-99), which she claimed was shared by \"perhaps thousands\" of other people.\nLegal implications.\nSometimes, people are accused of a crime, and often part of the evidence consists of facts other people remember. It is a problem to convict someone of a crime, based only on such evidence. In the case of sexual abuse or of child abuse these memories will usually be bad ones, and the brain will have changed them, as a measure of protection. Before a conviction is done, the court needs to make sure that the conviction does not happen based on the recollection of only one person, as recovering the \"facts\" behind the memories can be difficult.

She lives in China.\nLife.\nWoeser is a quarter Han and three quarters Tibetan. She was born in Lhasa. Her grandfather as a Han ethnic. He was an officer in the Nationalist Army of the Kuomintang. Her father was a high ranking Army officer in the People's Liberation Army.\nWhen Woeser was a small child, her family moved to the Kham area of western Sichuan province. In 1988, she graduated from Southwest University for Nationalities in Chengdu with a degree in Chinese literature. She worked as a reporter in Kardz\u00e9 and later worked in Lhasa. In 2003, she moved to Beijing because of political problems. Woeser is married to Wang Lixiong, a famous author. Lixiong often writes about Tibet. According to Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res, \"Woeser is one of the few Tibetan authors and poets to write in Chinese.\" Because the government refused to give Woeser a passport, Woeser sued the government.\nWork.\nWoeser wrote a book, \"Notes on Tibet\" (\u897f\u85cf\u7b14\u8bb0; \"X\u012bz\u00e0ng B\u01d0j\u00ec\").

Radio Free Asia said that she continued to write poems and articles on her two blogs: Maroon Map (\u7edb\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u5730\u56fe, \"oser.tibetcul.net\"), which, according to the author, was visited mostly by Tibetans, and the Woeser blog \"(blog.daqi.com/weise)\", which was visited mostly by those of Han ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by the government. The blogs were probably closed because she wrote birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and wrote about other sensitive topics. Woeser said that she would continue to write and to speak.\nDuring the Tibetan unrest of 2008, Woeser and her husband were put under house arrest after they spoke to reporters. In December 2008, Woeser and her husband were among the first of the original 303 people to sign Charter 08, Now, thousands more have signed it. Liu Xiaobo, the author of Charter 08, went to prison for 11 years. He received the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.

She is the rector of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) since 2009. Castellanos has worked against violence in Honduras, working mostly on drug cartels and police corruption. She worked for reform of the courts and the police. In 2004, Castellanos started the Observatorio de la Violencia (Violence Observatory) at UNAH. The Violence Observatory analyzes crime statistics in Honduras. She was also a member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The job of this commission was to find the facts of the 2009 coup that removed President Manuel Zelaya from power.\nLife and education.\nCastellanos was born in San Francisco de Becerra, Olancho on 8 January 1954. Her mother was Rafael Castellanos of Santa B\u00e1rbara, and her father was Ernestina Ruiz of Olancho. She grew up in the sugar fields of rural Honduras. In 1968, Castellanos' father gave her a test to be a student at the Normal School for Girls in the city of Tegucigalpa. She entered the school and graduated in 1973 with a teaching degree. In 1974, Castellanos won two scholarships to study social work at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) and social sciences in the College of Teachers. After several years of study, she finished her studies with a master's degree in economics from UNAH and a bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Costa Rica. \nAfter she finished her studies, Castellanos became a professor at UNAH in 1978. She was head of the Social Sciences Department and President of the Association of Teachers from 1997 to 2001. Castellanos was also the President of the Association of Professors of the University Center of General Studies (CUEG) in 1986, Coordinator of the Violence Observatory since 2005, consultant to the Arias Foundation for Human Progress and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), and Research Associate of the Centro de Documentati\u00f3n de Honduras (CEDOH). For 13 years, Castellanos was also the author of a newspaper column.\nHead of the National Autonomous University of Honduras.\nCastellanos was elected to a four-year term as Rector of the National Autonomous University of Honduras in 2009. At the time of her appointment as rector, she was also the Coordinator of the UNAH Violence Observatory and Director of the Instituto Universitario en Democracia Paz y Seguridad (Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security, IUDPAS). IUDPAS was started with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) when Castellanos worked as a consultant for the UNDP. Castellanos took the place of Jorge Abraham Arita, who was removed for incompetence. In a press conference, College Board president Olvin Rodriguez said Castellanos was chosen as rector because she was well-respected by the university community, and also by Honduran society and internationally.\nShortly after Castellanos got the job of rector, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from power in a coup. During a demonstration by University students, the police tired to stop the demonstration. The police pushed Castellanos down when she tried to stop them. During her time as rector, she had disagreements with SITRAUNAH, the union for the University's employees. She also received criticism because she fired 60 employees who protested at the university 2009. Castellanos oversaw the construction of a sports complex, an administrative building, and a university clinic. The university invested L1,500 million in the clinic.\nCastellanos' four years as rector ended in April 2013. She remained interim rector. In September 2013, she won an election for another term as head of the university.\nWork against violence and corruption.\nCastellanos was a strong advocate for police reform and against violent crime in Honduras. She pushed for an international commission to oversee a purge of the police. The National Congress of Honduras approved the idea. Castellanos also spoke about gun politics in Honduras. She asked the Honduran armed forces to destroy illegal guns, including AK-47s.\nIn October 2011, the Honduran national police kidnapped and killed Castellanos' 22-year-old son. The incident called attention to the degree of corruption within the Honduran police. Castellanos called for an end to foreign aid for the Honduran police and military, demanding that they \"stop feeding the beast.\"\nAwards.\nCastellanos received the first Martin Luther King, Jr. Award on 20 April 2012. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Foundation and the Instituto Hondure\u00f1o de Cultura Interamericana gave her the award in a ceremony.\nIn March 2013, Castellanos received the International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. State Department. US Secretary of State John Kerry and First Lady Michelle Obama presented the award."}

He had already taken more than 600 items from the gardens he roams around in. Most of his theft happens at night. The most he has brought home at once is eleven things, his owners say. He has even been caught on camera carrying home a bra.\nEarly years.\nDusty was born on March 20, 2006. He lives in San Mateo, California. He was adopted from an animal shelter; the Peninsula Humane Society. His owners are Jean Chu and Jim Coleman.\nFor his first two years, Dusty stayed home and seemed to be a normal cat. But in 2008, his owners began to find items and clothes that did not belong to them showing up in the house. Sometimes, the cat would put them in his owner's bed. They began to suspect that their cat was bringing them home. This turned out to be very true.\nFame.\nDusty didn't really get much attention outside of his neighborhood until February 2011. Animal Planet had read about him in People magazine. Animal Planet had a TV show named \"Must Love Cats\" and they made a feature about Dusty. Their crew was able to set up a night vision camera and catch Dusty bringing home his treasures. After this, there was a news story on KGO TV station in San Francisco .

He was interviewed with his owners on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on February 22, 2011.\nOther events.\nAfter he was seen on Letterman's show and other news shows around the world, Dusty became a celebrity. He has been shown at many community events in the San Francisco Bay Area.
