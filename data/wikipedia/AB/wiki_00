Before it was the Hadean It is followed by the Palaeoarchaean. \nThe Eoarchaean is the earliest period of geology after the solidification of Earth's crust. The abiotic origins of life (abiogenesis) have been dated to a time window from 4 to 3.6 billion years ago when atmospheric pressure values ranged from 100 to 10\u00a0bar.\nChronology.\nIt was formerly officially unnamed and usually referred to as the first part of the \"Early Archaean\" (now an obsolete name) together with the later Palaeoarchaean Era. It is the first part of the Archaean Eon, preceded by the Hadean Eon.\nThe Eoarchaean was followed by the Palaeoarchaean Era.\nThe name comes from two Greek words: \"eos\" (dawn) and \"archaios\" (ancient). The 1st supercontinent Vaalbara appeared around the end of this period around 3.6 billion years ago.\nGeology.\nA characteristic of the Eoarchean is that Earth possessed a firm crust for the first time. However, this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface. The beginning of the Eoarchaean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system: the Late Heavy Bombardment. The Eoarchaean is the first phase of our planet from which solid rock formations survived. The largest is the Isua greenstone belt at the southwest coast of Greenland. It appeared during the Eoarchaean around 3.8 billion years ago. The Acasta Gneiss within the Canadian Shield have been dated to be 4.03 Ga and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008 another rock formation was discovered in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt in northern Qu\u00e9bec in Canada which has been dated to be 4.28 Ga. These formations are presently under intense investigation.\nEarth's oceans formed 3.8 billion years ago."}

Most of the coastal and southern parts of the state have a Mediterranean climate with somewhat rainy winters and dry summers. The deserts in the south of the state have very hot summers and mild winters. Parts of the south have a semi-arid/steppe climate, for example San Diego.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) averages from 1981-2010, \nCalifornia is the 13th warmest state in the United States with the average annual temperature of 58.4\u00a0\u00b0F (14.7 \u00b0C) \nTemperature range.\nNorthwest California has rainy cool winters and dry summers with temperatures in the summers in the upper 60s to the upper 70s. The Central Valley has a semi-arid climate with temperatures in the winter sometimes at nights fall below 30\u00a0\u00b0F (-1.1 \u00b0C) and at daytime rises above 80\u00a0\u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) with summers being from 80 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit at day. The desert areas in southern California has a hot and very dry climate with precipitation in some areas below 5 inches (127 mm) a year. Temperatures are mild in southern California's desert in the winter and temps can range from 60\u00b0F (15.5 \u00b0C) to 80\u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) at daytime with nights being chilly with temperatures ranging from 35\u00b0F (1.7 \u00b0C) to 50\u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Temperatures are usually very hot during the day in desert places like Needles, San Bernardino and Palm Springs in the summer with daytime temperatures being from 105\u00b0F (40.5 \u00b0C) to 120\u00b0F (48\u00b0C) sometimes reaching above 120\u00a0\u00b0F (48 \u00b0C) and with nights being from 75\u00b0F (23.9 \u00b0C) to 90\u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C).

He fought for land rights and compensation for the Maralinga Tjarutja people against the Australian and British governments in the 1980s and 1990s. He played an important role in the 20-year campaign of the Maralinga people regaining access to their land after the British nuclear weapons tests.\nEarly life.\nBarton was born in South Australia in March 1936; the exact date is unknown. He was born at a siding on the east-west Trans-Australian Railway line, about east of Ooldea. His mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman from the Maralinga lands. It is not known who his father was, and Barton never knew him, but he is believed to have been a White railway worker. He was given the surname \"Barton\" because that was the name of the siding where he was born (Barton Siding). Archie spent his infancy in the care of his mother at Ooldea, which at the time was a mission station for Aboriginal people.\nAt the age of five, Barton became a victim of the Stolen Generations. He was taken from his mother and placed into a children's home in Port Augusta run by the Christian Brethren. When he was captured, he was hiding behind the skirt of Daisy Bates, a well-known writer who was living near Ooldea at the time. Archie never saw his mother again.\nHe was taught by the Christian Brethren until he was 12 years old. After this, he was sent to work on agricultural stations. He worked at a number of stations during his teenage years, and was often aggravated at being treated differently to White workers. After this, he worked several jobs as a labourer, including on the railway. In his twenties, Barton moved to Adelaide where he worked digging trenches for the South Australian Gas Company. While there, he became an alcoholic, got tuberculosis and spent a year in a sanitorium. By the time he was in his thirties, his addiction to alcohol was so bad that a doctor gave him six months to live. He immediately gave up drinking, and later began working for an Aboriginal alcohol-rehabilitation service in Port Augusta.\nMaralinga.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the British government tested nuclear weapons at the Woomera Test Range in central South Australia. The first two bombs were exploded at Emu Field, located to the north of Maralinga, in 1953. Major tests were done at Maralinga in 1956 and 1957, and multiple smaller tests were made up until 1963. Barton was still a young man at the time. Maralinga was Barton's mother's country, and remains the homeland of the Maralinga Tjarutja people. Most of the indigenous families living in these lands were forced to move out of the area before the major tests began. They were placed in Aboriginal missions and settlements built by the government.\nOne of these settlements was Yalata, located far to the south. The community at Ooldea was relocated there in 1952. In 1981, Barton was chosen as a community adviser for Yalata. Four years later, in January 1985, the government of South Australia handed back the native title to the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Barton was appointed administrator of the newly created Maralinga Land Rights Council. However, the land remained contaminated from the nuclear waste and was not fit to be lived in.\nIn his role as administrator, Barton led the Maralinga people in their campaign to get the land cleaned and restored so that they could safely return to living there. He represented his people before many enquiries and commissions, in both Canberra and London. A royal commission into the nuclear tests was done by the Australian government. This was the McClelland Royal Commission, for which Barton helped provide evidence. Ten years later, in 1995, the government paid the community AU$13.5\u00a0million in compensation. Barton and two elders travelled to London in 1991 and 1992, to negotiate with the British government. They met with the leader of the House of Lords, Viscount Cranborne, to whom Barton presented two bags of soil from Maralinga, tainted with plutonium.\nThe clean-up of the land was estimated to cost over AU$100\u00a0million. It took several years before the British offered an acceptable contribution, which was about \u00a320\u00a0million. The clean-up was completed in 2000, but the test sites themselves will remain poisonous for many thousands of years.\nLater life.\nBarton served as the administrator of the Maralinga Land Rights Council for 20 years (1985\u20132005). He was forced to resign the office in 2005, when it was discovered that he had stolen $230,000 of community money. His friends blamed old age and the stress of financial demands from his relatives. His reputation and position in the community was destroyed, and he became poor, unhealthy and an outcast. He lived in sheds in Whyalla and Port Augusta during this time. He was welcomed back into the community shortly before his death, but by that time he was already very weak.\nBarton died on 18 October 2008, in Ceduna. He was buried at Oak Valley, the new settlement built near Maralinga when the traditional owners returned to their lands. He no children of his own, but looked after the children and grandchildren of his long-term partner Mary Harrison.\nRecognition.\nBarton was awarded the South Australian Aboriginal of the Year in 1988, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989. In 1996, he was given an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Adelaide.\nIn 2001, he became one of the founding members of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He served as a member of the National Indigenous Council from 2004 to 2005. He also served as a director of Imparja Television, the national Aboriginal broadcasting network."}

John Forrest, a minister in Alfred Deakin's government, became leader the party. Candidates were selected for all electorates in the 1906 federal election. By the time the election was held, support for the party had ceased. Forrest was elected, but not as a WAP member. However, the party did elect one member, William Hedges, as the member for Fremantle. He was a member of the WAP, although he sat as an independent and, like Forrest, joined the Commonwealth Liberal Party when it began in 1909.\nThe party policies were explained in a 12-point program. Many of these were to promote the interests of Western Australia as a member of the new Australian federation. This included keeping as much government revenue as possible. It also included items important to Western Australia such as coastal defence, and building a railway to the eastern states. It also wanted to introduce deciaml currency, and metric weights and measures."}

Students from a dozen of nationalities participate to the different curricula at \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille.\nMost of the 1500 graduate engineer students at \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille live in dedicated residential buildings nearby research labs and metro public transports on a campus that is shared with 20,000 students from Lille University of Science and Technology.\nHistory.\n\u00c9cole Centrale de Lille was founded as \u00c9cole des arts industriels et des mines de Lille in 1854, with support from scientists such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kuhlmann and Louis Pasteur. It succeeded to the municipal chairs of experimental physics, applied chemistry and mechanics that were established in 1817. It became a technical university in 1872 with the integration of the Institut industriel du Nord. Since mid 19th century, the Baccalaur\u00e9at and completion of undergraduate studies have been a prerequisite for admission. The initial focus was on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A stress on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science (1957), supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics, telecommunications, nanotechnologies (1994).\nSince early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a French classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles or similar undergraduate studies.\nIt was originally in Lille central district.

That is light, or other signals, which has had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. The observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every place in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.\nThe word \"observable\" does not depend on whether modern technology actually allows detection of radiation from an object in this region. It simply means that it is possible \"in principle\" for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, there is much that we cannot see. We can see light only from as far back as when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons. \nSometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the \"visible\" universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination\u2014and the \"observable\" universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (that is, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology). The radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light years), about 2% larger.\nThe best estimate of the age of the universe as of 2013 is 13.798 \u00b1 0.037 billion years. Due to the expansion of the universe humans are observing objects that were originally much closer but are now considerably farther away (as defined in terms of cosmological proper distance, which is equal to the comoving distance at the present time) than a static 13.8 billion light-years distance. The diameter of the observable universe is estimated at about 28 billion parsecs (93 billion light-years), putting the edge of the observable universe at about 46\u201347 billion light-years away."}

William Brewster III (1566 \u2013 April 10, 1644) was an English official who was a passenger on the \"Mayflower\" in 1620. He was a religious leader both in Europe and in Plymouth Colony. He was also one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. \nWilliam Brewster III was the son of Capt. William Brewster, Jr. (1533-1622) and Mary Smythe Simkinson (1537-1655), Capt. William Brewster, Jr. was the son of Col. William Brewster, Sr. (1500-1616) and Maud Mann (1506-1619), William III lived in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England.\nBrewster studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Cambridge was a university where many people wanted to change the Church of England. People who agreed with this started different religions. They were called Separatists. In England, Separatists were put into jail.\nBrewster worked for a time for William Davison in the Netherlands. Davison went to jail because he was a Separatist. When Davison went to jail, Brewster went back home to Scrooby for a time. He became a postmaster. Brewster began a Separatist church in his house. In 1607, He also went to jail for a short time for doing this in. Brewster and other members of the Church decided to move to Netherlands in 1608. They hoped that would be able to practice their religion there. To leave England without permission was illegal, so they left in secret. In 1609, he was chosen as the leader of the congregation.\nIn Leiden, Brewster taught English. In 1616 he was a printer and made religious books for sale in England. In 1619, Brewster and Edward Winslow published a religious booklet which disagreed with King James I and the Church of England. The King ordered Brewster's arrest. He was forced to hide. The printing press was taken by the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. The congregation had already decided to leave Leiden for the New World. While Brewster was in hiding, the other members of the church looked to others such as John Carver and Robert Cushman to make the plans. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Cushman, he and Cushman were able to get aboard the \"Mayflower\" with their friends. His wife and two of his sons, Love and Wrestling, were also passengers.\nThe \"Mayflower\" voyage and the New World.\nThe Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. \nBrewster became the senior religious leader at Plymouth Colony. He also served as an advisor to Governor William Bradford.\nThe Brewster and his wife Mary had six children: Jonathan, Patience, Fear, who married Isaac Allerton, Unnamed child, Love Brewster, and Wrestling Brewster\nBrewster's son Jonathan, arrived the next year on the ship \"Fortune\". Brewster's daughters Patience and Fear arrived aboard the \"Anne\".\nBrewster was given land on the islands of Boston Harbor. Four of those islands are named after him. In 1632, Brewster also received lands in nearby Duxbury and moved there from Plymouth Colony to build a farm. \nAn epidemic killed many English and Indians in the region. William Brewster lost two daughters, Fear and Patience in 1634.\nWilliam Brewster died and was buried on 10 April 1644 at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. There is a memorial for him which says it is in honor of \"Elder William Brewster Patriarch (father) of the Pilgrims and their Ruling Elder 1609\u20131644\".

Many times in history, people have used nonviolence to show that they are equal without hurting anybody. Other times were more violent with people who began to rebel against others. Many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals. However, many of them helped make steps toward equality.\nThe main goal of the civil rights movements is that all people's rights are equally protected by the law, including the rights of minorities. Civil rights movements are different from each country. The LGBT rights movement, Women's rights movement, and many racial minority rights movements are still continuing to fight for equal rights.\nAfrica.\nAngola.\nThe Angolan War of Independence was fought from 1961 to 1975. Angola fought against Portugal. Portugal was making people in Angola farm cotton. Three different groups in Angola were against Portugal. Millions of people died during the war.\nGuinea.\nBefore 1974, the Portuguese Empire also controlled Portuguese Guinea. From 1963-1974, in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, the people in Guina fought for their independence. In 1974 they won, and formed the independent country of Guinea-Bissau.\nMozambique.\nThe Mozambican War of Independence was fought from 1964 until 1975. It was fought between Portugal, which controlled Mozambique; and the Mozambique Liberation Front or Frelimo (). The Portuguese won the conflict, using guerilla soldiers. However, because of a coup d'\u00e9tat in Portugal, Mozambique became independent on June 25, 1975.\nIreland.\nIn Northern Ireland, the Campaign for Social Justice was formed in Belfast in 1964. Next the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed. These groups wanted to:\nThese demands for reform caused a backlash by some in the unionist majority. This caused The Troubles to start. The Troubles were a civil war that lasted for more than 30 years.\nThe NICRA used the same methods used by the American Civil Rights Movement: nonviolent marches, pickets, sit-ins, and protests. The first civil rights march in Northern Ireland was held on 24 August 1968 between Coalisland and Dungannon.\nUnited States.\nSegregation.\nSegregation was an attempt by white Southerners to separate the races. They did this to strengthen white pride and to be more powerful over African Americans. Segregation was often called the Jim Crow system.\nSegregation became common in Southern states after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. Reconstruction followed the Civil War (1861-1865). During Reconstruction, Republican governments in the Southern states were run by black people. The Reconstruction governments had passed laws opening up economic and political opportunities for black people. However, by 1877, the Democratic Party had gained control of government in the Southern states. These Southern Democrats wanted to reverse black advances made during Reconstruction. To that end, they began to pass local and state laws that said certain places were \"For Whites Only\" and others for \"Colored\". Black people had separate schools, transportation, restaurants, hospitals, and parks. Usually, they were not as good as the white-only places. Over the next 75 years, Jim Crow signs went up to separate the races in every possible place.\nThe system of segregation also included not letting African-Americans vote (this is called disfranchisement). Between 1890 and 1910, all Southern states passed laws that made it difficult or impossible for black people to vote. For example, some laws said a person had to be able to read and write in order to vote. A lot of black people had no access to education and property ownership. Because black people could not vote, they were powerless to prevent whites from segregating all aspects of Southern life. They could do little to stop discrimination in public places, education, economic opportunities, or housing.\nConditions for black people in Northern states were somewhat better. Black people were usually free to vote in the North, but there were so few of them that their voices were barely heard. Segregated facilities were not as common in the North. Black people were usually denied entrance to the best hotels and restaurants. Schools in New England were usually integrated (with black and white students together). However, those in the Midwest generally were not.\nMontgomery Bus Boycott.\nOn December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a member of the Montgomery, Alabama, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was told to give up her seat on a city bus to a white person. When Parks refused to move, she was arrested. The local NAACP, led by Edgar D. Nixon, recognized that Parks' arrest might rally local blacks to protest segregated buses. Montgomery's black community had long been angry about their mistreatment on city buses, where white drivers were often rude and abusive. The community had previously considered a boycott of the buses. The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a success, with support from the 50,000 blacks in Montgomery. It lasted for more than a year. This event showed the American public that blacks in the South would not stop protesting until the end of segregation. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956. The boycott ended with the blacks winning the right to sit wherever they wanted.\nA young Baptist pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. King became the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) when it was founded in 1957. SCLC wanted to celebrate the NAACP legal strategy by encouraging the use of nonviolence. These activities included marches, demonstrations, and boycotts. The violent white response to black direct action eventually forced the federal government to confront the issues of injustice and racism in the South.\nIn addition to his large following among blacks, King had a powerful appeal to liberal Northerners that helped him influence national public opinion. His advocacy of nonviolence attracted supporters among peace activists. He formed alliances in the American Jewish community. He also developed supporters from the ministers of wealthy, influential Protestant congregations in Northern cities. King often preached to those congregations, where he raised funds for SCLC.\nChicano Movement.\nThe Chicano Movement is a political, social, and cultural movement by Mexican Americans. The Chicano Movement addresses negative ethnic stereotypes of Mexican people in the media and by Americans. People such as Tiburcio Vasquez and Joaquin Murietta became folk heros to Mexican Americans. They refused to obey White Americans.\nAmerican Indian Movement.\nThe American Indian Movement (AIM) is a Native American activist organization in the United States. It was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The organization was formed to stop issues concerning the Native American urban community in Minneapolis. They wanted to stop poverty, housing, treaty issues, and police harassment.\nGender equality.\nThe first feminism equality issues was suffrage rights. This led women to get the right to vote. The second feminist issue involved economic equality (for example, getting paid the same as men if they did exactly the same kind of work).\nLesbians are also part of women's rights. The lesbian feminist groups, such as the Lavender Menace, are a lesbian activism group.\nLGBT rights and gay liberation.\nThe events of the Hawaii Supreme Court promoted the United States Congress to create the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. This act forbids the federal government from accepting same-sex relationships to get married. Currently 30 states have passed state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage. However, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont made gay marriage legal.\nBefore 1993, lesbian and gay people were not allowed to serve in the United States military. Under the \"Don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) policy, they were only allowed to serve in the military if they did not tell anyone of their sexual orientation. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 allowed homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed forces. Since September 20, 2011, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have been able to serve openly. However, transsexual service-members still cannot serve openly, due to Department of Defense medical policies which consider gender identity disorder to be a medically disqualifying condition.\nPeople who oppose gay rights in the United States have been political and religious conservatives. These people cite a number of Bible passages from the Old and New Testaments as their reason. The most opposition of gay rights are in the South and other states with a large rural population. Many organizations have opposed the gay rights movement. These include the American Family Association,\nthe Christian Coalition, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Save Our Children, NARTH, the national Republican Party, the Roman Catholic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church),\nthe Southern Baptist Convention, Alliance for Marriage, Alliance Defense Fund, Liberty Counsel, and the National Organization for Marriage. A number of these groups have been named as anti-gay hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nGermany.\nThe Civil Rights Movements in Germany was a left-wing backlash against the post-Nazi Party era of the country. The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a protest movement to others around the globe during the late 1960s.\nFrance.\nA general strike broke out across France in May 1968. It became a revolutionary problem. It was discouraged by the French Communist Party. It was finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone demographic, such as workers or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding ethnic, cultural, age and class boundaries."}

The following problem illustrates the error:\nThe intuitive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts.\nThe reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts. \nMore generally, the problem can be stated as follows:\nThe correct answer may be \"n\" \u2212 1, \"n\", or \"n\" + 1, depending on the conditions. The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.\nOff by one errors often occur with loops. If there are a number of fields, eg. in an array, and there is a loop over the array, an off-by-one error means that either there is one iteration too few to cover all elements, or one too many. In the first case, one element of the array is left out, in the second the index of the array will be outside its dimensions. The second error usually leads to an runtime error, because the program checks the size of the data structure, and sees that there are too few elements for the iteration. The first error is more problematic, because it usually is not detected. All that may point to the error is that one element is not initialized or does not have the expected value. "}

He was known as \"Cato Minor\" to distinguish him from his great-grandfather (Cato the Elder). A noted orator, he had great moral integrity. He could not be bribed, and disliked the political corruption of the age. He is remembered for his stubbornness and for his lengthy conflict with Julius Caesar.\nPlutarch tells a story about Cato's peers' immense respect for him, even at a young age. During a Roman ritual military game, called \"Troy\", in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of \"coming of age\" ceremony, a mock battle with wooden weapons was performed on horseback. While the child of one of Sulla's surrogates was chosen by the adult organizers to lead one of the \"teams,\" the team refused to follow him because of his character, and when they were finally asked whom they would follow, the boys unanimously chose Cato.\nCato's political and military career.\nAs a military tribune, Cato was sent to Macedon in 67 BC at the age of 28. He was given command of a legion. He led his men from the front, sharing their work, food, and sleeping quarters. He was strict in discipline and punishment but was popular with his legionaries. When in Macedon, he got the news that his brother Caepio was dying in Thrace. He set off to see him but his brother died before he arrived. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, for once, he spared no expense to organize lavish funeral ceremonies.\nQuaestor.\nOn his return to Rome in 65 BC, Cato was elected to the position of quaestor. One of his first moves was to prosecute former quaestors for misusing funds and dishonesty. Cato also prosecuted Sulla's informers, who had acted as head-hunters during Sulla's dictatorship. Cato did this even when the men were well connected politically. At the end of the year, Cato stepped down from his quaestorship amid popular acclaim, but he never ceased to keep an eye on the treasury, always looking for irregularities.\nAs senator, Cato was scrupulous and determined. He never missed a session of the Senate and publicly criticized those who did so. From the beginning, he aligned himself with the \"Optimates\", the conservative faction of the Senate. Many of the Optimates at this time had been Sulla's personal friends, whom Cato had despised since his youth, yet Cato attempted to make his name by returning his faction to its pure republican roots.\nTribune of the plebs.\nIn 63 BC, he was elected tribune of the plebs for the following year. He helped the consul, Cicero, deal with the Catiline conspiracy. Lucius Sergius Catilina, a noble patrician, led a rebellion against the state, raising an army in Etruria. \nWhen Cicero discovered a plot against the consuls and other magistrates in Rome, he arrested the conspirators. Cicero proposed to execute them without trial (which was not lawful). In the Senate's discussion, Julius Caesar agreed the conspirators were guilty, but argued for distributing them among Italian cities \"for safekeeping\". In contrast, Cato argued that capital punishment was necessary to deter treason: it was folly to wait for the test of the conspirators' guilt. Convinced by Cato's argument, the Senate approved Cicero's proposal, and the conspirators were executed. Most of Catilina's army quit the field, much as Cato had predicted.\nCato against Caesar.\nCato was a supporter of Pompey, and continued the fight after Pompey was dead. The anti-Caesar forces, known as the Optimates were reinforced by forces from local rulers. They numbered about eight legions (40.000 men) plus sixty elephants. Caesar defeated the Optimates at the Battle of Thapsus in modern Tunisia, North Africa. Cato did not actually take part in the battle, which was led by a colleague, and committed suicide after the defeat. Roughly 10,000 enemy soldiers wanted to surrender to Caesar, but were instead slaughtered by Caesar's army. This was unusual for Caesar, who was known as a merciful victor. No explanation of this is known."}

Many very distant galaxies seen, for example, in the Hubble Deep Field are known to be starbursts, but they are too far away to be studied in any detail. Looking at nearby examples give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe. The light we see from distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger (see redshift). \nStarburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe, and are more common further away.

Two subsequent starbursts followed, the last of which (~4\u20136 myr ago) may have formed the core star clusters.\nUnknown object.\nIn April 2010, radio astronomers at the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester reported an unknown object in M82. The object started sending out radio waves, and the emission did not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before.\nThere have been several theories about the nature of this unknown object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. The object is several arcseconds from the center of M82. It has an apparent motion of four times the speed of light relative to the galaxy centre."}

The galaxy is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, its brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate.\nThe Baby boom galaxy has been called \"the extreme stellar machine\" because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year. Our Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year.\nAt its rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed.\nThe discovery challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation. This has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old. Evidently, the galaxy was doing this when the universe was still in its infancy.\n\"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once\", said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center. To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded:\n\"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe\".\nMulti-wavelength.\nThe different colors in the figure of the Baby boom galaxy refers to different wavelengths.

Ibarra was married to Corina Parral de Velasco Ibarra until his death in 1979.\nPresidency.\nIn 1933, he stood in the Ecuadorian presidential election and received 80% of the votes cast, the highest in Ecuadorian history. Velasco Ibarra traveled through several Latin American countries, including Peru, and restored Ecuador's global image. His first presidency began on September 1, 1934, but he was ousted in August 1935 by the military.\nIn May 1944, because of the May 28 \"Glorious Revolution\", he was named Supreme Chief of the Republic and was later named Constitutional President by the Constituent Assembly. In August 1947, he was again deposed by the military. Three defense ministers perpetuated the coup against Velasco Ibarra; among them was minister Mancheno, who later was his successor.\nIn 1952, he again won the presidential election, and began his third term as president on September 1, 1952. This time, he served his entire term, which ended on August 31, 1956. His third term was a time of progress for Ecuador: 311 schools were constructed, with another 104 in progress. More than 1359\u00a0km of roads were constructed, and 1057\u00a0km more were improved.\nIn 1960, he was elected president for the fourth time and was removed on November 7, 1961. In 1960, he nullified the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, which led to conflicts between Ecuador and Peru, including Paquisha in 1981 and the War of El Cenepa in 1995.\nFinally, in 1968 Velasco Ibarra won the presidency for a fifth time. This government ended abruptly on February 15, 1972, when once more he was deposed in a bloodless coup, which brought General Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez Lara to power.

Winslow helped to organize the voyage to the New World and was a leader at Plymouth Colony. He signed the Mayflower Compact\nEarly life.\nEdward Winslow was born in Droitwich, Worcestershire England. His parents were Edward and Magdalene Winslow. In 1613 Winslow was apprenticed to a London printer. Winslow became a Separatist which was a religion that did not believe in the Church of England.\nIt was illegal to be a Separatist in England, so in 1617 Edward Winslow moved to Leiden, Netherlands where he worked with William Brewster. They started to print religious booklets which were critical of the English king and his bishops. The English King ordered Brewster\u2019s arrest, and he was forced to hide.\nThe Separatists were planning to move to America and they need leaders to plan the voyage. Thomas Weston helped them by providing the ship \"Mayflower\" for their journey. Winslow's brother Gilbert and family servant George Soule and a youth, Elias Story went with him. Elinor (Ellen) More, a girl of eight years, also went with them Elinor died in the winter of 1620 with only one brother Richard More surviving.\n\"Mayflower\" Voyage.\nEdward Winslow left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" spotted land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Winslow signed the Mayflower Compact. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.\nIn Plymouth Colony.\nThe men went to land to explore a place where they all could live. One of the missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edwary Doty. Bradford wrote that they set off in freezing weather and many of the men were ill. He said that \"when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as\nif they had been glazed\". Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During their trip they saw Native Americans who were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. \nPlymouth Colony lost over half of its population because of sickness, lack of proper food and the cold winter. With the help of friendly Native Americans, they learned to grow food. In 1621, Winslow and the others attended what would have the first Thanksgiving.\nThe next year they were able to load the ship \"Fortune\" with furs and other supplies. This was to pay the men would helped pay for the trip to the New World. On the return trip, the \"Mayflower\" was attacked by the French and all the cargo was taken.\nOn February 21, 1621, William White died leaving a widow, Susanna, and two sons, Resolved and Peregrine. Edward Winslow had lost his wife Elizabeth on March 24, 1621. In 1621, Edward Winslow and Susanna White became the first couple to marry in Plymouth Colony. They had 5 children: A (child) who died young, Edward Winslow, Josiah Winslow and Elizabeth. Josiah became the 13th Governor of Plymouth Colony.\nWinslow had a friendship with native leader Massasoit. These Native Americans were friendly and helped the Pilgrims. In January 1629 a fishing and trading post opened up on the Kennebec River near Plymouth Colony. Isaac Allerton also opened his own trading post there and this caused problems between the two men.\nIn 1632, Winslow explored the Connecticut River. \nWinslow was a diplomat and a spokesperson for the Pilgrims with English officials. Winslow was a governor in 1634, 1636 and 1644 and was a member of the United Colonies of New England. This was a military group which protected the pilgrims against unfriendly Native Americans.\nEngland had a civil war in the 1640s. Some pilgrims returned to fight against the King. In 1646, Winslow began working for Oliver Cromwell. Winslow never returned to Plymouth Colony.\nIn 1654, Winslow fought against the Spanish in the West Indies. They won the battle but Winslow became ill and died from yellow fever. He was buried at sea. Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts has a stone monument which lists the names of the Winslow family. There is another memorial stone w/plaque stating \"Edward Winslow, Founder of Marshfield\". Edward Winslow's first wife Elizabeth Barker Winslow was buried in 1621 in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth, Massachusetts."}

The dinsaur grew to about 1.5\u00a0meters (5\u00a0ft) long.\nPhylogeny.\nThe primitive nature of \"Saturnalia\", and its mixture of sauropodomorph and theropod characteristics, has made it difficult to classify. \nThe first (1999) description of the genus assigned it to the Sauropodomorpha. However, in a 2003 paper, Langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the sister group of sauropodomorphs, the theropods, and that \"Saturnalia\" could be considered a member of the sauropodomorph \"stem-lineage\", rather than a true member of that group. \nJos\u00e9 Bonaparte and colleagues, in a 2007 study, found \"Saturnalia\" to be very similar to the primitive saurischian \"Guaibasaurus\". Bonaparte placed the two in the same family, Guaibasauridae. Like Langer, Bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs, or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte found that both \"Saturnalia\" and \"Guaibasaurus\" were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like.

His name means \"Great Leader\".\nEarly years.\nMassasoit was born in a Pokanoket village at the site of today's Rhode Island. His village was near a spring of water which is named after him. He was liked by seven leaders. In March 1621, a Native American named Samoset entered Plymouth Colony and said to the Pilgrims in English, \"Welcome Englishmen\". He had learned some words from the English fishermen and traders that had visited his tribe. He said he was sent by Massasoit, \u201cthe greatest leader of the country.\u201d After a few days, Massasoit came in person and was received with great friendship. \nMassasoit made a treaty with the Pilgrims. They promised to protect each other against unfriendly Native Americans. They promised not to hurt each other. They also promised to help each other as friends. Massasoit told the pilgrims that there was much sickness where the colonist were now living and that many had died. The treaty was kept as long as Massasoit lived.\nPeace treaty.\nMassasoit helped the people of Plymouth Colony in many ways, including how to plant corn. He became friends with the all of the colonial leaders.\nChildren.\nDuring this time, Massasoit had five children. His oldest son, \"Moanam\" or Wamsutta, died within a year after his father, and his brother Metacom (Philip) became chief in 1662.\nAlliance.\nThere was some bad feeling for a time when the Plymouth leaders refused to give up Squanto to Massasoit. He believe that Squanto had betrayed him. This was settled when Edward Winslow visited him in March 1623. Massasoit was ill and Winslow took care of him. After he got better, Massasoit said the English are my friends and love me. He also said that while he lives he would never forget the kindness they have showed me.\"\nThe Wampanoag and the English maintained a friendship until Massasoit's death. During this time, Massasoit sold lands to the English that they needed. When Roger Williams, was sent away from the Massachusetts colony, he spent many weeks with Massasoit. Massasoit was friendly and honest and always kept his word. He warned the pilgrims of any Native Americans who were not their friends.\nMassasoit died as early as 1660. When he died, his son Wamsutta became chief. When Wamsutta died Metacom (Philip) took his place. Of Massasoit's five children, the only child to survive King Philip's War in 1676 was his daughter, Amie, wife of Tispaquin.\nIn fiction.\nMassasoit was a character in \"The Mayflower Voyagers\", a 1988 episode of the Peanuts television series, \"This is America, Charlie Brown\". \nAt the beginning of the 1995 movie adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\", Massasoit dies and his tribe cremates him."}

It takes place in New York City.\nGameplay.\nPotential contestants enter a taxi driven by Bailey. When they get in and say where they want to go, they are made aware that they are in the Cash Cab through ceiling lights and music, followed by Bailey's greeting. They are then asked if they want to play. If they do not want to play, they can get out of the taxi. If they do want to play, they have to stay in the taxi until they reach where they want to go or get three strikes.\nContestants who play are asked a series of questions by Bailey. The first four questions are worth $50, the next four are worth $100, and questions after that are worth $200. In the first two seasons, the questions were worth $25, $50, and $100. If a contestant answers a question wrong, they get a strike. If the contestant gets three strikes, they have to get out of the taxi no matter where they are. Contestants have two helps known as \"Shout-Outs.\" The first Shout-Out is the Mobile Shout-Out, which lets the contestant call someone they know for help. The call can take up to 15 seconds. The other Shout-Out is the Street Shout-Out, where Bailey pulls over the taxi, and the contestant can ask someone on the street for help.\nWhen the taxi has to stop at a red light and the contestant has at least $200, a \"Red Light Challenge\" is played. A question will be given that has more than one correct answer. The contestant has 30 seconds to give all of the correct answers to the question. If the contestant does so, they get $250. If the 30 second time limit runs out, the contestant doesn't get a strike. Most games have only one Red Light Challenge, but starting in the fourth season, some games have more than one. The second is played if the contestant has at least $1,000.\nIf the contestant gets to where they wanted to go without getting three strikes, they have a choice: they can leave the taxi and keep the money they won, or risk it on a Video Bonus question. If they decide to play the Video Bonus question, a clip is played, and a question is asked based on it. If the contestant answers correctly, their money is doubled. If they give a wrong answer, they lose all of their money.\nStarting in the fourth season, some games are Double Ride games. The first four questions are worth $100, the next four are worth $200, and questions after are worth $400. The Red Light Challenge is worth $500.\nOther versions.\nIn 2007, a spin-off, \"Cash Cab: After Dark\", started. Contestants were picked up near or after sunset, as well as overnight. The questions were worth double the amount of \"Cash Cab\", and the questions were harder.\nAnother spin-off, \"Cash Cab: Chicago\", started during \"Cash Cab\"'s sixth season. It was hosted by Beth Melewski and used the same rules as the New York \"Cash Cab\". It ended after one season."}

It may be called an ocellus, or pigment pit. They are quite common in small, simple invertebrates, such as \"Planaria\". They do not have lenses or any means of focussing. Therefore, they can sense light from dark, but do not give the animal a visual scene as our eyes do.\nIn many simple animals the eyespot senses light with a pigment molecule called an opsin. Then a nerve fibre goes from the eyespot to the simple nervous system. This allows the animal to move in response to (for example) a shadow passing over it.\nEyespots also occur in single-celled protists like \"Euglena\" and \"Chlamydomonas\", where it is connected to the flagellum. This allows the information from the light patch to influence the cells's movement.\nThe first fossils of eyes that have been found to date are from the early Cambrian period (about 540 million years ago). This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the \"Cambrian explosion\". One idea is that the evolution of eyes started an arms race which led to a rapid spate of evolution. Much earlier than this organisms would have used light spots for light sensitivity, but did not have a visual scene for rapid navigation."}

The English first tried to make the Roanoke Colony in 1584. A war delayed resupply until 1890. When the ships arrived, the colonists were gone. The decision to settle Jamestown again came from a group called the Virginia Company of London. Virginia was settled again in 1607 at Jamestown, this time successfully. The Virginia Company had its charter revoked in 1624 for not showing a profit. At that time the colony of Virginia became a crown colony. It became a British colony after 1707.). It remained an English colony until the American Revolution. \nThe name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \"The Old Dominion\" by King Charles II. He gave Virginia colony the name for its loyalty to the crown during the era of the Commonwealth of England. When Virginia colony was first settled it was a huge geographic area that was England's claim on all of North America. After the United States was formed, the entire states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio were all later created from the territory that was once known in the Colony of Virginia."}

The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells. Each cell has one of several possible states. With each \"turn\" or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells. \nA very famous example of a cellular automata is Conway's Game of Life. Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann first described cellular automata in the 1940s. Conway's Game of Life was first shown in the 1970s. \nBiology.\nSome biological processes occur\u2014or can be simulated\u2014by cellular automata.\nThe patterns of certain seashells are generated by natural cellular automata. Examples can be seen in the genera \"Conus\" and \"Cymbiola\". The pigment cells are in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell secretes pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule. The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly. For example, the widespread species \"Conus textile\" bears a pattern resembling Wolfram's rule 30 cellular automaton.\nPlants regulate their intake and loss of gases via a cellular automaton mechanism. Each stoma on the leaf acts as a cell.\nMoving wave patterns on the skin of cephalopods can be simulated with a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automata, each state corresponding to either an expanded or retracted chromatophore.\nThreshold automata have been invented to simulate neurons, and complex behaviors such as recognition and learning can be simulated.\nFibroblasts are similar to cellular automata, as each fibroblast only interacts with its neighbors."}

If wood is cut into boards with the growth rings roughly perpendicular to the face of the board, the medullary rays often produce beautiful \"figure\" such as silver grain, medullary spots, pith flecks, etc.\nThe function of medullary rays is to carry chemicals which fight invasion by insects and fungi, and block any damaged areas.

{"id": "401698", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401698", "title": "Vellum", "text": "Vellum is a high-quality form of parchment. Originally, it meant calf skin, but in English the term is used more widely.\nLike parchment, the skin is prepared to take writing in ink. It was one of the standard writing surfaces used in Europe before paper became available. It continued to be used for high-status documents. The vellum was used for single pages, scrolls, codices or books.\nTo manufacture vellum, the skin is cleaned, then bleached, stretched on a frame called a \"herse\", and scraped with a knife. When vellum is scraped, it is by turns wet and dry to create tension. A final finish is got by rubbing the surface with pumice, and treating it with lime or chalk. Then it is ready to accept ink.\nModern \"paper vellum\" (sometimes called vegetable vellum) is made out of synthetic material instead of mammal skin, but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum.\nUse in the past.\nIn ancient Europe, vellum meant good quality prepared animal skin. Calves, sheep, goat and even camel are known to have been used to make vellum. The very best vellum was made from unborn animals. It can be hard to identify the animal used to make old vellum without using a science lab.\nFrench sources defined velum (or velin in French) as made from calves only. This has remained true in modern times.\nUsage.\nMost of the best sort of medieval manuscripts were written on vellum. Some Buddhist texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei Torah texts are written on vellum or something similar.\nA quarter of the 180 copy edition of Johannes Gutenberg's first Bible printed in 1455 was also printed on vellum, presumably because his costumers expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing at the time.\nIn art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and watercolours. Old master prints were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.\nLimp vellum or limp-parchment bindings was used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes gilt. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but mainly it is not, as many people like its faint grain and hair markings.\nMany documents that needed to last long were written in vellum as it was able to last longer than paper. Some vellum-written documents are more than a thousand years old.\nModern usage.\nBritish Acts of Parliament are still printed on vellum for archival purposes, as are those of the Republic of Ireland. It is still used for Jewish scrolls, for luxury book covers, memorial books, and for various documents in calligraphy.\nToday, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. Only one UK company still supplies them. A modern vellum-like alternative is made out of cotton. Known as paper vellum, this material is cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and crafting supply stores. Some brands of writing paper and other sorts of paper use the term \"vellum\" to suggest quality.\nIn the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, \"vellum\" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called \"parchment\".\nPaper vellum.\nPaper vellum is made from cotton. Usually translucent, paper vellum in various sizes is often used in applications where tracing is required, such as architectural plans. Like natural vellum, the paper vellum is more stable than paper, which is frequently critical in the development of large drawings and plans such as blueprints.\nStorage.\nVellum is typically stored in a stable environment with a stable temperature. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to mechanical stresses; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to mold or fungus growth. The best temperature for the preservation of vellum is 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0F)"}

Her parents are mentioned as Imran (\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646) and Hannah (\u062d\u0646\u0627) and her sibling is Harun (\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646). She is one of the most important and righteous women in Islam. She is mentioned in the Quran more than in the New Testament (Bible). She is the only woman mentioned by name in the Quran. Many Muslim women look up to her as an example. According to the Quran, Allah (God) chose Mary above all women of all nations. The Quran states: \nBehold! the angels said: \"O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations.\nMary in the Quran.\nMary is mentioned in the Quran frequently. Her life narrative occurs in the earliest chapters. The nineteenth chapter is named after her. The chapter is called \"Maryam\".\nFamily.\nIn the Quran, Mary is believed to be a daughter of (Imran) Amram and (Hanna) Anne. While some confuse the parents of Moses. Aaron and their Sister Miriam to be the same of the Virgin Mary, this is not correct. While Moses and Harun did have a sister named Miriam (Mary,) and while their father was also named Amram (Imran), this does not mean that the parents of both Prophet Moses and The Virgin Mary were the same. However, the outcome of this result is still unknown for certain. \nMary sister of Aaron and daughter of Imran.\nthe Hebrew name \"Merriam\" The original name for Mary. In the Qur\u2019an, Mary is called the daughter of Imran, and sister of Aaron. This made some Jews and Christians claim that the Qur\u2019an didn't make a difference between the time of Moses and Jesus but there is a hadith. To clarify this issue Al-Mughira reported:\n\"When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of Najran) asked me: You read \" O sister of Aaron \" in the Qur'an, whereas Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to the prophet I asked him about that, he said: The (people of the old age) used to give names (to their children) after the names of Apostles and pious persons who had gone before them\" Meaning that Aaron here was not Moses' brother but another one. Al-Baghawi also cites a narration from Al-Kalbi that Aaron referred to here was a brother of Maryam through her father, and he was the most righteous man amongst children of Israel in that time.\nThe Quran states Jesus came after the Jewish prophets of Israel. So, according to the Quran, there is a long distance between Moses and Jesus. \"Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him.\" Surah Al-Ma'idah.\nBirth.\nThe birth of Mary is mentioned in the Quran in various chapters. Her father Imran () is also mentioned in the Quran. The Quran says that Hannah and Imran were old and had no children for years. One day Anne saw a bird feeding her young. Seeing this made Anne want a child for herself. She prayed to Allah for a child. She promised that if her prayers were answered, her child's life would be dedicated to the service of Allah. Anne also prayed for her child to be protected from the \"touch\" of Satan (; ).\nEarly years.\nThe Quran says that Mary grew up in the temple of prayer and had a special place of her own in the temple. The Quran states that there was a cast of the dice to decide who would become the guardian of Mary. The person chosen through this process was the Prophet Zechariah. Often, when Zechariah would visit the chamber of Mary, he would find her with quantities of food. He always asked her where she had obtained the food, and Mary would always answer: \"Allah provides to whom he will.\" As a prophet, Zechariah would not have questioned this response because he would have known that Allah is the provider of all things in life and, indeed, of life itself.\nAnnunciation.\nThe birth of Isa and the Annunciation of Mary are very important to Islam. They are considered to be some of the most important miracles of Allah. The first mention of the Annunciation following the Birth of Isa is in sura 19 (Maryam) ayah 20. The Quran tells us that the Angel Gabriel (, al-Ru\u1e25 al-Quds, Jibra'il) came to the Virgin Mary and told her that she would soon be pregnant with a holy child. The Virgin Mary asked how it would be possible for her to become pregnant when no man had touched her. The Angel Gabriel replied that nothing is impossible for Allah, and that the Birth of Jesus would be a sign for all mankind. The birth is mentioned later at sura 66 (At-Tahrim) ayah 12, where the Quran says that the Virgin Mary remained pure while Allah created Isa inside her womb.\nVirgin Birth of Jesus.\nThe Quran speaks of the virgin birth of Isa many times. The Quran also states that Jesus was created when Allah breathed on Mary while her body was chaste.\nThe Quran's narrative of the birth of Isa is different from that of Jesus as found in the New Testament. The Quran says that Mary was suffering childbirth pains, when she saw a nearby palm tree and held on to it. While she was holding on to the tree, she heard a voice that seemed to come from the earth beneath the tree. The voice said, \"Grieve not! Thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thy feet. Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards thyself and It will drop its fresh ripe dates upon thee.\" Mary then promised not to speak with any man that day. \nLater, after Isa's birth, Mary brought him to the temple. All of the men in the temple mocked her, except Zechariah, who believed in the virgin birth. The Israelites demanded to know how she could possibly have had a baby without a man, whereupon the Virgin Mary responded by pointing to Jesus who then spoke his first prophecy.\nArabic titles.\n\"O Mary! Worship your Lord devoutly: prostrate yourself\".\n\"O Mary! Bow down in prayer with those men, who bow down.\" This is believed to be the command to Mary by the Angels.\n\"O Mary!

She was also a nightclub entertainer, a singer, and one of the early \"Playboy\" Playmates. Mansfield became a major Broadway star in 1955, a major movie star in 1956, and a major celebrity in 1957.\nEarly years.\nMansfield was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904\u20131936) and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903\u20132000). She was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Her father was of German descent and her mother was of English descent.\nAfter her father's death in 1936, Jayne, her mother, and stepfather Harry Lawrence Peers moved to Dallas, Texas. After high school graduation, she studied acting at Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Austin.\nWhile in college, she had a number of small jobs such as hat check girl and nightclub photographer. She won many beauty pageants. She performed in local theater productions around Austin.\nCareer.\nIn 1955, Mansfield went to New York City. She appeared in the Broadway production of \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" The critics praised her performance. She appeared in 400 plus shows of the play between 1955 and 1956.\nShe went to Hollywood in 1956. 20th Century Fox signed her to a six-year contract in an effort to replace the troubled Marilyn Monroe. Her first starring movie role was Jerri Jordan in \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (1956).\nDuring production, she still appeared on Broadway in \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" The movie studio finally bought out her contract, and shut the show down. In 1957, she appeared in a movie version of the play.\nMansfield's movies include \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957), \"Too Hot to Handle\" (1960), and \"Promises! Promises!\" (1963). She won the Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female for \"The Wayward Bus\". On television, she made guest appearances on drama series, game shows, variety shows, and many talk shows.\nMansfield was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells. When the demand for big-breasted blonde bombshells decreased in the early 1960s, she became a box-office has-been.\nShe remained a popular celebrity however. Her nightclub acts and summer theater appearances attracted crowds. She made cheap \"indies\" and European melodramas and comedies.\nMansfield became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood movie. The movie was \"Promises! Promises!\". Hugh Hefner published nude photographs of Mansfield on the movie set in the June 1963 issue of \"Playboy\". He was hauled into Chicago city court on obscenity charges.\nPersonal.\nMansfield married public relations professional Paul Mansfield in 1950. They had one daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield.

Three of her children - Mikl\u00f3s, Zolt\u00e1n and Mariska - escaped death with minor injuries. An urban legend about Mansfield being decapitated in the crash is untrue.

He was a servant to Stephen Hopkins. Hopkins was making his second journey to the New World having travelled for ten years under Capt. John Smith at Jamestown in Virginia Colony.\nEarly life.\nDoty was born in England. It is thought he was from East Halton in Lincolnshire. According to author Charles Banks, Doty lived in London at some point and traveled with another Londoner, Stephen Hopkins, as his servant.\n\"Mayflower\" Voyage.\nEdward Doty left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" spotted land. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.\nDoty was one of two indentured servants of Stephen Hopkins. The other servant was Edward Leister. They travelled with Hopkins and his family.\nWhen they landed the men went to find a place where they could live and grow crops. One of the first exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish , Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. According to William Bradford, they left in a small board in below freezing weather. Many of the men were already ill. Bradford wrote that when they set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During this trip the \"Mayflower\" men came upon some Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a large whale. The Natives ran when they saw the men. The men camped while trying to protect themselves and stay warm. \nIn late 1620, Doty went with Stephen Hopkins and others on other explorations of the Cape Cod area.\nIn Plymouth Colony.\nDoty was one of the \"Mayflower\" passengers that has left a record of his personality. He had a quick temper that sometimes caused him trouble. Some said he was an unfair businessman. People who made trouble were often banished from Plymouth. Isaac Allerton was forced out. Doty must have changed for the better because he lived in Plymouth his whole life.\nEdward Doty became a rich land owner with servants himself. At times, he could be disagreeable with others. This caused him to be in the Plymouth court many times.\nDoty\u2019s first problem with the law came after the Pilgrims had begun building their settlement. In June of 1621 Doty fought a duel (with a sword and dagger) with Edward Leister. Edward Leister was the other servant of Stephen Hopkins. The result was that one man was wounded in the hand and one in the thigh. Their punishment was to be tied head and feet together for one day without food or drink. But soon their master Stephen Hopkins felt sorry for them and asked to end their punishment. He promised they would change their behavior. The Governor let them free.\nIn the 1623 Division of Land, Doty received 1 acre of land. After that he received 20 acres more. He also purchased much land and became quite wealthy. Some of his land in Plymouth is where the Mayflower Society House now stands.\nDoty received some cattle in the 1627 Division of the Cattle. At that time he had finished his term of service to Stephen Hopkins. His name as \u201cEdward Dolton\u201d, is listed with the family of John Howland and wife Elizabeth. In Plymouth Colony records, Doty\u2019s name was also spelled variously as Doten (Mayflower Compact), Dotey (1626 Purchasers and 1643 bear arms lists), Dolton (1627 Division of the Cattle), and Dowty (1633/34 tax lists). \nThe 1632 records of the Plymouth Court has twenty-three cases that mentions Edward Doty. There were complaints that he cheated people, said bad things about people which were not true, fought with people, and stole. Doty was never punished except for paying small fines. This means that most of the cases were found to be untrue or very minor cases. Except for the duel in 1621, he never had any physical punishment. Physical punishment could have been whipping, branding, banishment, prison and public punishment.\nExcept for his occasional court cases, Doty lived a normal life as a freeman, paying his taxes and all his debts. He received some special property rights and benefits from being classed as a \u201cfirst comer\u201d or \"Mayflower\" passenger.\nThe joined with other members of the community in a town meeting of February 10, 1643. He was assigned with George Clark, John Shaw, Francis Billington and others to build a wolf trap in the town of Plain Dealing.\u201d\nDoty's name appears on the August 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List. It is spelled \u201cEdward Dotey\u201d. This was for the protection of the colony against unfriendly Indians or other enemies.\nEdward Doty married Faith Clarke. They had nine children.\nThe parents of Faith Clarke on January 9, 1635 were Thurston (Tristram) and Faith Clarke. They arrived in Plymouth Colony on the ship \u201cFrancis\u201d in 1634. Many of Doty\u2019s court cases involved Thurston and George Clarke. He had many disagreements, including fights with the family of his wife. Bradford wrote that Doty by a second wife has seven children, and all are living. They had two more children after he wrote that.\nThe children were named Edward, Thomas, John, Samuel, Desire, Isaac, Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary.\nEdward Doty made out his will on May 20, 1655. Doty said that he was sick but still had a good memory. His will was witnessed by John Howland, John Cooke, James Hurst, and William Hoskins. Doty signed his will with a mark because he never learned to write.\nEdward Doty died on August 23, 1655 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony and was buried at Burial Hill Cemetery where there is a memorial stone for him."}

It is considered the century when Italy was the leader in the European civilization \nCharacteristics.\nIn the Cinquecento the most important center of culture in Italy was Rome, while Florence suffered from the Girolamo Savonarola rebellion and the end of the Medici power in the city.\nIndeed, in Rome the Pope promoted a huge art program (like the construction of St. Peter Cathedral and the Sistine Chapel) that brought to the eternal city artists of the level of Michelangelo, Raphael, Cellini, and Bramante.\nMichelangelo Buonarroti was one the most famous artists in the Cinquecento Italy: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer. Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he was often called a \"Renaissance man\" which means that he had great talent in many areas. Michelangelo lived an extremely busy life, creating a great number of artworks. Some of Michelangelo's works are among the most famous that have ever been made. They include two very famous marble statues, \"the Pieta\" in Saint Peter's Basilica and \"David\" which once stood in a piazza in Florence but is now in the Accademia Gallery. His most famous paintings were huge frescos, the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the \"Last Judgement\". His most famous work of architecture was the east end and dome of Saint Peter's Basilica.\nOnly Venice in Italy was able to reach a similar level to the one of Rome, mainly in paintings: Bellini, Giorgione and Tiziano created their masterpieces in this century.\nThe tuscan Leonardo da Vinci lived the last years of his life in the Cinquecento. He created in this century two of his pictures that are among the best-known paintings in the world: the \"Mona Lisa\" and the \"Last Supper\".\nIn 1532 The Prince -a masterpiece of Italian literature- was published: it was a political treatise by the Italian diplomat, historian and political theorist Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\nIn architecture the Cinquecento is famous because of Andrea Palladio (1508\u201380), \"the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance\". Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form.\nWhen he used the \u201ctriumphal arch\u201d motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant\u2019Andrea\u2019s. This Ancient Roman motif is often referred to as the \"Palladian Arch\".\nThe second half of the Cinquecento was characterized by the development of the \"Umanesimo\", related even to science discoveries like the one done by Galileo Galilei in astronomy and critical thoughts like those of Giordano Bruno.\nHistorically the Cinquecento is characterized by the end of the process of unification of Italy, because of the French invasions and the \"Sack of Rome\" in 1527. Later in the century Italy was devastated by the \"Italian wars\" done mainly between France and the emerging Spain (a new country that enjoyed the richness and power from the discovery of America done by Cristoforo Colombo), that divided between themselves the Italian peninsula and its \"Rinascimento richness\"."}

He was born in Budapest, Hungary. He was married to Jayne Mansfield. He is the father of actress Mariska Hargitay. During their marriage, Hargitay and Mansfield made four movies together. These were \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" (1957), \"The Loves of Hercules\" (1960), \"Promises! Promises!\" (1963), and \"L'Amore Primitivo\" (1964).\nEarly life and sports career.\nHargitay was born and raised in Hungary. He was an acrobat in an act with his brothers. He was soccer player and a speed skater. He was an underground fighter during World War II. Hargitay left Hungary after the war. He moved to the United States where he settled in Cleveland. \nHe married Mary Birge. He had an acrobatic act with her. They had one child, Tina, born in 1949. Hargitay worked as a plumber and carpenter. He begin bodybuilding after seeing a magazine cover of Steve Reeves. \nHargitay became NABBA Mr. Universe in 1955. He joined Mae West's muscleman show at the Latin Quarter nightclub in New York City. He married Jayne Mansfield in 1958. They divorced in 1964. He is the first to receive the Joe Weider Lifetime Achievement Award. In May 2006, he received the Muscle Beach Hall of Fame Award.\nActing career.\nHargitay's first movie role came when Jayne Mansfield demanded he have a part in her newest movie, \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" (1957). The two had met the year before at \"The Mae West Show\" at the Latin Quarter nightclub. When Jayne saw Mickey on the stage, she told the waiter, \"I\u2019ll have a steak and that tall man on the left.\" \nThe two fell head over heels in love. They were never seen apart. 20th Century Fox didn't want Hargitay in \"Rock Hunter\", because they hated Mansfield's idea of Hargitay as her \"only\" lover. Fox liked their sex symbols to be single. But when Jayne told the studio that she would turn the movie down, they gave in and let Hargitay appear in a bit part. \nIn 1960, Jayne and Mickey would play the lead roles in \"The Loves of Hercules\". The movie was shot in Italy. It was never released in the United States. Over the next few years Mickey and Jayne, together, would appear in, \"Promises! Promises!\" (1963) and \"L'Amore Primitivo\" (1964). In 1965, Mickey, only, would have the lead role in \"Bloody Pit of Horror\". There was a part in the movie written for Mansfield, but the two divorced before shooting began. Hargitay also acted in the 1988 movie, \"Mr. Universe\".\nHargitay's last acting appearance was in an episode of his daughter Mariska's series, \"\". In the episode \"Control\" (2003), Hargitay played a man on a subway station escalator who witnesses the aftermath of a brutal assault. Mariska's character, Olivia Benson, is later seen interviewing him.\nPersonal life.\nHis first marriage was to Mary Birge. Together they had a daughter Tina Hargitay (b. 1949). They divorced on September 6, 1956.\nHargitay and Mansfield married on January 13, 1958. They had three children: Mikl\u00f3s Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (b. December, 21 1958), Zolt\u00e1n Anthony Hargitay (b. August 1, 1960), and Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (called Maria, b. January 23, 1964). \nHargitay remodeled much of his and Mansfield's Beverly Hills mansion, \"The Pink Palace\". He built its famous heart-shaped swimming pool. In November 2002, the house was razed by developers. \nIn May 1963, Mickey and Jayne divorced in Mexico. The divorce was ruled invalid. The two reconciled in October 1963. After Mariska's birth, Mansfield sued for the Mexican divorce to be declared legal. She won. The divorce was recognized in the United States on August 26, 1964. After Mansfield's death in a car crash on June 29, 1967, Hargitay sued Jayne's estate for over $5,000 to support the children. In their divorce decree, she had agreed to pay child support and to give him approximately $70,000 in cash and property. \nHargitay married Ellen Siano in September 1967. They were married until his death.\nDeath.\nHe died in Los Angeles on September 14, 2006, aged 80, from multiple myeloma. The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted in Hargitay's obituary:"}

The larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish. Cone snails use a hypodermic-like modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before eating it. The tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon. It is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail, at the end of the proboscis. They can \"sting\" humans, and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all.\nCone snail venoms are mainly peptides. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of some larger species can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. Cone snail venom may be a source of new, medically important substances. \nSome Cone snails are no longer living, like Conus adversarius. "}

The theory was proposed by Alan Guth in the 1970s. \nBasic Idea of Inflation.\nBased on the Standard Model of Cosmology, the universe has been and is expanding. The classical Big Bang theory assumes that the universe expanded at the same rate throughout universal history. Inflation says that the universe \"has not\" always expanded at the same rate, and that the universe has experienced many periods of brief but immense expansions in which the size of the universe nearly doubled. These periods, as said, were extremely short, lasting less than a second. After a single period, the expansion slowed down until the next rapid inflation came and, again, massively increased the size of the universe. \nProblems Solved by Inflation Theory.\nThe main problem solved by inflation is the origin of large-scale structures, such as galaxies. Inflation theory says that in a slow expansion of the universe, quantum fluctuations were only on the tiny distance scales; when the universe experienced a brief period of inflation, however, these quantum fluctuations are \"stretched\" much larger to cause density fluctuations. The places of higher density later caused matter to clump in those locations and form large-scale objects. \nAnother problem is that of temperature uniformity in the universe: why is the temperature so evenly distributed? Inflation says that objects that were previously in close proximity to one another were separated very quickly during a period of inflation, so the temperature balance was still held. In the classical Big Bang theory this was a problem because the uniform expansion would mean that objects would have to travel many times the speed of light to maintain temperature balance. \nAnother problem that inflation possibly solves is the problem of magnetic monopoles. Why do we no longer see magnetic monopoles in our universe? Inflation says that the few existing monopoles were so dispersed during periods of inflation that it is virtually impossible to find them now. \nMathematical Formulation.\nInflation theory uses General relativity to model the inflation mathematically. The metric of inflation theory is\nformula_1\nPredictions of Inflation Theory.\nInflatons.\nThe main prediction of inflation theory is that particles called inflatons are created from a scalar field from Quantum field theory. These inflatons would drive the inflation periods of the universe, but they quickly decay so the inflation periods are not very long at all. It was initially thought that the Higgs boson was an inflaton, but that has recently been discredited. \nMultiverse.\nInflation theory also suggests that there might be other universes. If inflation caused our universe, could it not also cause many other universes as well? This prediction has no empirical basis, but it has been explored in modern physics."}

His first race was a race created French tourists in his hometown in Morocco. He won the race, and the prize of a small blue truck. After the race, he talked to the Morocco Paralympic Committee about competing in athletics, but Moroccans said no. After he got to Spain, he took part in a race in Barcelona organized by El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in 2003. He did well and people took notice. He then raced in other races in the area. The Athletics Federation of Catalonia and others helped Ait Khamouch get Spanish citizenship in time for him to represent Spain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.\nThe first athletics club Ait Khamouch belonged to in Spain was the Athletic Club Nou Barris. In 2004, he competed the Spanish Paralympic national championships where he finished first in the 800 meters. In 2005, he got a scholarship from the Spanish Paralympic Committee.

He was one of thirty-two competitors from Spain at the competition. In 2012, he got a \u20ac2,500 coaching scholarship. He lost part of his Catalonian scholarship a year and a half before the London Paralympics. Ait Khamouch said the loss of the scholarship was politically motivated. In 2012, he set a world record at the Barcelona Marathon. He also set a qualifying time in the event for the London Paralympics at the Barcelona Marathon.

But not all of Dalmatia was annexed by Italy, as the German puppet state - the Independent State of Croatia - took some sections of the Dalmatian areas, though the Italian army held control over all of Dalmatia.\nThe Kingdom of Italy divided the Governorship in three Italian provinces: \"Zara\" (Zadar), \"Spalato\" (Split) and \"Cattaro\" (Kotor), but never created officially an Italian region with the name \"Dalmatia\" (waiting for the future peace conference). While the Governorship was not officially a region of Italy, the northern Dalmatian islands of Krk (\"Veglia\") and Rab (\"Arbe\") were administratively united to the Italian province of Fiume and became areas of the Kingdom of Italy.\nIn September 1941, Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, ordered the military occupation of the entire Dalmatian coast and islands (like Ragusa, Lissa, and Pago) that belonged to fascist Croatia of Ante Paveli\u0107: he tried to annex those areas to the Governorship of Dalmatia, but was temporarily stopped by the strong opposition of Paveli\u0107, who retained nominal control of those areas. \nThe northern dalmatian islands of Krk and Rab were not added to the Governorship of Dalmatia, but were added to the Italian \"Province of Fiume\". This province was enlarged with areas of northern coastal Dalmatia to the east of Fiume.\nTerritory.\nThe Governatorate of Dalmatia consisted of three provinces: Zara, Cattaro and Spalato. The administrative capital was Zara. After autumn 1941 also the Dalmatian islands of Pago and Lesina, initially given to the croatian dictator Ante Pavelic, were annexed. These islands were occupied militarily by the Italian army, along with an area of fascist Croatia that was off the coast of Segna to the center of Bosnia (near Sarajevo and Banja Luka).\nAfter the Kingdom of Italy changed sides to the Allies in 1943, German forces took over the area. This territory was not given to the fascist Italian Social Republic (which was a puppet state of Nazi Germany), but instead completely dissolved and added to the puppet Independent State of Croatia. \nBut Zara remained Italian (even under control of the German Army) until 1945 (the city suffered a terrible bombing in 1944)."}

For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal.\" Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, \"In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album.

In January 1980, \"Trouser Press\" also named it one of the best albums of 1978.\nLater reception of the album has been mostly positive. Steve Huey of the online music database Allmusic scored the album four and a half \"stars\" calling it \"arguably Devo's strongest set of material, though several brilliant peaks can overshadow the remainder\", and \"a seminal touchstone in the development of American new wave.\" \"Q: Are We Not Men?

He was an indentured servant to John Carver and travelled with him when they left England to settle in the New World. He signed the Mayflower Compact and helped to build Plymouth Colony.\nThe voyage.\nJohn Howland was born in Fenstanton, Huntingdon, England around 1591 and was the son of Margaret and Henry Howland, and the brother of Henry and Arthur Howland. The brothers travelled later from England to Plymouth.\nThe Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. The first few days had good weather. They ran into a great storm with heavy winds and large waves. For days the ship could not use it's sails. The first mention of him was by William Bradford. During the storm Howland was walking on deck and was washed overboard by a large wave. He somehow caught a rope and was pulled to safety. In all there were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21.\nPlymouth Colony.\nThey wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.\nWhen the \"Mayflower\" landed several men went to land to try to find a place where they could live. One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Hopkins was the most experienced. He had seen Native Americans when he was at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, \"and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed\". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians.\nHalf of the Pilgrims died by the end of the first winter. Howland lived with the Carver family The following spring, on an very warm day in April, Governor Carver was planting corn when he came out of a cornfield feeling ill and he soon died. Carver was much loved by the passengers. He was a wealthy man who very hard worked along with all of the pilgrims. Bradford wrote Carver had worked himself to death. After Carver's death, Howland became a freeman. This meant that he could own his own land and could vote in Plymouth affairs. Howland was given an acre for each member of the Carver household including himself and Elizabeth Tilley, Desire Minter, and a boy named William Latham.\nHowland was one of eight settlers who agreed to help to pay the colony's debt to the men in England who had paid for the voyage. From 1641 to 1655 Howland was voted deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. He was elected again in 1658.\nHowland went with Edward Winslow to exploration of Kennebec River (in current day Maine), looking for possible fur trading sites and natural resources that the colony could use. While Howland was in charge of the colony's trading post, an sad incident happened there. William Bradford wrote was that it was \"one of the saddest things that befell the Pilgrims.\" A group of traders from the Piscataqua River, was led by a man named John Hocking. Hocking started to trade in an area that did not belong to him. Howland warned Hocking to depart, but Hocking, took out a pistol and refused. Howland ordered his men to set the canoe adrift. The Plymouth men managed to cut one cable when Hocking put his pistol to the head of Moses Talbot, one of Howland's men, and shot and killed him. Another of the Howland group shot Hocking.\nIn Plymouth the Howlands lived on the north side of Leyden Street. They lived in other places such as Duxbury and Kingston where they had a farm. The farm burned down in 1675 during King Philip's War. By that time, John had died and Elizabeth moved in with her son, Jabez.\nFamily.\nUntil Bradford's \"Of Plymouth Plantation\" was discovered in 1856, it was presumed that John Howland's wife, formerly Elizabeth Tilley was the adopted daughter of Carver's. Actually her parents, uncle and aunt came to the New World but died of sickness during the first winter.) This mistake was even recorded on a gravestone that was erected for Howland on Burial Hill, in 1836.\nThey had ten children. Desire, John, Hope, Elizabeth, Lydia, Hannah, Joseph, Jabez, Ruth and Isaac.\nJohn Howland died February 23, 1673 at the age of 80. He had outlived all other male \"Mayflower\" passengers except John Cooke, son of Mayflower passenger Francis Cooke. He is buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts."}

It is an updated version of the game show \"Password\". It aired from June 1, 2008 to June 14, 2009. It was hosted by Regis Philbin.\nGameplay.\nThe game is played in two parts. The first part of the game has two contestants and two celebrities. Both contestants play 30-second rounds where they try to get five words from clues given by their celebrity partner. Clues have to be one word. The celebrity can give as many clues as they want for each word. They must wait for a response from the contestant before giving a new clue. Only one clue can be given at a time. After each contestant plays, they switch partners. The contestant who gets the most words after four rounds wins and moves on to the Million Dollar Password round. If the contestants are tied after four rounds, a tie-breaking word is given to both teams, starting with the team who won a coin toss. The contestant who gets the word wins.\nMillion Dollar Password.\nThis round has a six-step prize ladder with a top prize of $1,000,000. The contestant's celebrity partner is the one who they got the most words with. If they got the same amount of words with both celebrities, their partner is the one that they last played with. The contestant can give or receive the clues for this round. For each step of the ladder, the clue giver has to get their partner to say five words in 90 seconds. Up to three clues can be given for each word. The clue giver can pass on a word, but cannot come back to it.\nIf the clue giver is successful in getting their partner to say five words, the contestant wins the amount on the level that they are on. They can then decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level. Each level has one less word than the last one. If a contestant fails on a level, the game ends. Failing on the first two levels means that the contestant leaves with nothing. Failing on the $50,000, $100,000 or $250,000 levels means that the contestant leaves with $25,000. If the contestant gets to the $250,000 level, they can play the $1,000,000 level with no risk of losing the $250,000.\nIf the contestant is giving the clues, starting at the $250,000 level, they are shown the words for that level before they decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level."}

Although there is not a \"left\" or \"right\" wing label to the party, it is considered by many to be more left-wing than the Republican Party but more right-wing than the Democratic Party. Many members say they are more socially liberal than the Republicans, but more conservative with money than the Democrats.\nAs of March 2016, there are over 410,000 voters registered as Libertarians. Hundreds of Libertarian candidates have been elected or appointed to public office, and thousands have run for office under the Libertarian banner.\nPresidential elections.\nThe Libertarian Party has had a number of records, such as being the first party to get an electoral vote for a woman in a United States presidential election. On May 5, 2012, Gary Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election.

All but one of the species are in the genus \"Begonia\". The only other genus in the family, \"Hillebrandia\", is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and has only one species.\nMany varieties (or cultivars) of some species and hybrids of the genus \"Begonia\" are used as ornamental plants.\nDescription.\nPlant and leaves.\nMost of the plants in this family are perennial herbaceous plants and very few are shrubs o subshrubs; they are from only a few centimetres to 3 metres tall. Their leaves and stems are succulents, that is, leaves and stems are juicy and store water.\nStems are upright (vertical) and many species form rhizomes or tubers (fleshy, thickened underground stems). In some cases, the stems are very short and the leaves are in a group close to the soil.\nThe leaves of most species are simple, undivided and with sides more or less unequal; in very few cases they are compound (divided). They are alternate or, when the stem is very short, they are all in a group.\nFlowers and fruits.\nBegoniaceae plants are mostly monoecious, so there are male and female flowers on the same plant; very few are dioecious, with only one kind of flower so the plants are either male or female. Flowers are grouped in inflorescences.\nThe fruits are capsules (simple, dry fruits) and sometimes berries; they have many very small seeds.\nChromosome number.\nThe chromosome number is variable, n=10-21 or more.\nGenera.\nThe family Begoniaceae was named in 1820 as Begoniae by the Bohemian scientists Friedrich Graf von Berchtold and Jan Svatopluk Presl in \"Prirozenosti Rostlin\", 1:270, and then in 1824 as Begoniaceae by the Swedish botanist Carl Adolph Agardh, published in \"Aphorismi Botanici\".\nThere are two genera in this family:\nThe New Guinean genus \"Symbegonia\" Warb. has recently been reduced to a section of \"Begonia\".\nWhere they grow.\nThe species of this family are found abundantly in all moist tropical countries, absent only from the Australian tropical forests.\nOne species, \"B. grandis\" grows in the temperate zone, growing as far north as near Beijing (China).\nUses.\nSome species, hybrids and cultivars of the genus \"Begonia\" are used worldwide as ornamental plants in parks, gardens, balconies and as houseplants because they have beautiful leaves and flowers."}

Many plants do it. By vegetative reproduction plants can cover the ground quickly: ground taken by one plant is difficult for other plants to take. This occurs naturally, and can also be done on purpose by horticulturists. \nVegetative reproduction uses mitosis. This means that the newly created cell is a clone, and identical to the parent cell. Some plants put out new roots underground, have bulbs, or grow new vines and shoots above ground.\nBy this process, new plants can be grown naturally without any seeds or spores. Therefore, it is widely used especially in agriculture to spread the trees that are of great value to the economy. \nCuttings.\nIn gardening and farming, vegetative reproduction means cutting a tree branch below its center joint, planting it in some other earth, and letting it form new roots. In this way, many kinds of useful plants can be easily reproduced without any seeds, for example: apple, avocado, banana, cacao, hemp, orange/lemon, date, fig, grape, almond, pineapple, potato, strawberry, sugar cane and tea.

As paramount leader, he holds the offices of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the President of the People's Republic of China, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As General Secretary, he is also a member of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body.\nEarly life.\nXi Jinping is the son of former Chinese Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun and Qi Xin. He rose politically in China's coastal provinces. He was the Governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002. Between 2002 and 2007, he was Governor and CPC party chief of Zhejiang. After the dismissal of Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to Shanghai as the party secretary for a short time in 2007. Xi was promoted to the central leadership in October 2007 and trained to become Hu Jintao's successor.\nGeneral Secretary.\nIn November 2012, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission in the CPC convention. In March 2013, he was elected as the President of the People's Republic of China by the Chinese Congress. This started his first term as China's leader.\nChinese leadership changes every 5 years, and it happens roughly in October/November (for CPC and military) and March next year (for government). In October 2017 and March 2018, Xi was re-elected as party, military and government leader. This started his second term.\nBy tradition in recent decades, the Chinese leader leads two terms (10 years in total). The second term identifies his successor and prepares for the power transfer. However, Xi stopped this tradition and abandoned his potential successors Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai, who were put to prison in 2018 due to corruption.\nOn 11 March 2018, the National People's Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, so that Xi and the future presidents could be reelected for president without term limits.\nIn July 2018, a trade war started between US and China. At the early stage Xi showed China's muscle by declaring to fight \"a tooth for a tooth\". As the conflicts continues to worsen, China softened its stance. There were reports that Xi's authority got damaged by his handling of the trade dispute with US.\nPersonal life.\nXi was born on 15 June 1953 in Beijing, China. His father held lots of posts, including party propaganda chief and vice premier. He has been married to Peng Liyuan since 1987. They have one daughter, Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in 2015. Xi lives in Zhongnanhai, China."}

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, films, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees.\u00a0Angelou was best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first,\u00a0\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\"\u00a0(1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.\nAngelou became a poet and writer after a series of jobs as a young adult, including fry cook,\u00a0sex worker, nightclub dancer and performer, cast member of \"Porgy and Bess\", coordinator for the\u00a0Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and journalist in\u00a0Egypt\u00a0and\u00a0Ghana\u00a0during the\u00a0decolonization of Africa. She was an actress, director, producer of plays, movies, and public television programs, and writer. In 1982, she earned the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at\u00a0Wake Forest University\u00a0in\u00a0Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Angelou was active in the\u00a0Civil Rights Movement\u00a0and worked with\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0and\u00a0Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou made around 80 appearances a year on the\u00a0lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" (1993) at Bill Clinton's inauguration, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since\u00a0Robert Frost\u00a0at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.\nWith the publication of\u00a0\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\", she publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide though attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as\u00a0autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.\nOn May 28, 2014, Angelou died in her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina of natural causes at the age of 86.\nEarly life.\nAngelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. Angelou's older brother Bailey, Jr., nicknamed Marguerite \"Maya,\" derived from \"My\" or \"Mya Sister.\" When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' \"calamitous marriage\" ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother Annie Henderson. In \"an astonishing exception\" to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because she \"made wise and honest investments\".\nFour years later, the children's father \"came to Stamps without warning\" and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, \"I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone...\" According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.\nShortly after Freeman's murder, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again. Flowers introduced her to authors such as Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Douglas Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson, authors who would affect her life and career, as well as black female artists like Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset.\nWhen Angelou was 14, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again, who had since moved to Oakland, California. During World War II, Angelou attended the California Labor School. Before graduating, she worked as the first black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. Three weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson)."}

She is mainly worshiped by Hindus for the prevention and cure of snakebites and infectious diseases like smallpox and chicken pox as well as for prosperity and fertility. She is also known as Vishahara (the destroyer of poison), Jagadgaur\u012b, Nity\u0101 (eternal) and Padmavati. She stands for both 'destruction' and 'regeneration', almost akin to a snake shedding its skin and being reborn.\nOrigin.\nOriginally Manasa was a Adivasi(tribal) goddess. Manasa was accepted into the Hindu pantheon ( groups of gods and goddesses ) by the lower caste. Later Manasa Swas accepted by the higher caste. She is now regarded as a Hindu goddess rather than a tribal one. \nIconography.\nThe idol of the goddess is depicted as a graceful lady with her body, adorned with snakes and sitting on a lotus or standing on a snake, under a hooded canopy of seven cobras with usually a geese next to her. She is often seen as 'the one-eyed goddess', and sometimes portrayed with her son Astika on her lap. Her one eye is due to a belief that her stepmother Chandi burnt one of her eyes out of jealousy.\nMyths and Legends.\n Her myths are emphasize by her bad temper and unhappiness because in many beliefs, her father, Shiva, rejected her and her step-mother Chandi hated her. In some scriptures, Kashyapa is considered to be her father. Her legends are based on her life.\nMahabharata.\nThe Mahabharata tells about her marriage. Sage Jagatk\u0101ru decided to abstain of marriage. He came across a group of men who were hanging upside down from a tree. These men were his ancestor who were doomed because their children did not perform their last rites. So they asked Jagatk\u0101ru to marry and to have a son who can perform the rites to free them. Vasuki offered Jagatk\u0101ru his sister, Manasa. Although Jagatk\u0101ru was abstaining from marriage he accepted. Manasa gave birth to their son, Ast\u012bka. Ast\u012bka performed the rites and freed their ancestor. Ast\u012bka also helped N\u0101ga from a Yanja, a fire offering by stopping the king Janamejaya.\nPuranas.\nThe Puranas are scriptures that tell the birth of Manasa. The story states that Sage Kashyapa was the father not Shiva. The story narrates that the serpents and reptiles created chaos on the earth. The Sage Kashyapa created Manas out of his mind (mana). The creator God Brahma made Manasa a deity of snakes and poison. Mansa then gained control over the earth by chanting mantras (prayers). Manasa then pleased Shiva, who told her to please Krishna. Because Krishna was pleased he granted her divine Siddhi powers and made her an official goddess by worshiping her ritually.\nMangalkavyas.\nThe Mangalkavyas were devotional paeans (songs) to local deities like Manasa.\nWorship.\nUsually Manasa is worshiped without an animal. An earthen pot, a branch tree, and/or an earthen snake image is used. Manasa images are also worshiped too. She is worshiped for cure and prevention of snake bites poison. She is mostly worshiped Bengal. She is worshiped in festivals like Nag Panchami-a snake festival. She is also worshiped in Assam, a musical folk theatre that is dedicated to her myths. Manasa is mainly worshiped during the rainy seasons, when snakes are mainly active."}

It is built across the Thane Creek. The bridge links Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai, and handles traffic in the region to the west and north of Mumbai.\nHistory.\nThe first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was made in 1973. The bridge is 1837\u00a0metres in length and has a below-requirement 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noticed on some parts of the bridge. This led to a series of extensive repairs. It was then decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one. \nConstruction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened in 1997. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic.\nThe Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has plans to add six more lanes to the Vashi Bridge at an estimated cost of 400 crore."}

In psychology, stress is a feeling of emotional strain and pressure. Stress is a type of psychological pain. Small amounts of stress may be beneficial, but more stress can increase the risk of strokes, heart attacks, ulcers, and mental illness, such as depression\nTypes of stress.\nThere are different types of stress. Each type has different characteristics and symptoms. \nStress response.\nOrganisms can respond to stress in different ways.\nStress may also lead to adaptations, which allow certain organisms to better deal with the stressors. Stress happens every day, and is part of every living thing's life. Too much stress is bad and can cause health problems. Stress plays a part in some physical problems, like heart disease. Stress also plays a part in many mental illnesses, like anxiety, Acute Stress Disorder, and PTSD. Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD are mental illnesses that can happen when a person experiences something that is very terrifying, like a major accident or a war. Another type of stress disorder is a \"psychosomatic illness\" where a person has physical symptoms that are caused by an emotional stress, not by physical harm. \nStress management.\nThere are different ways to deal with stress. One tip is to remove yourself from the stressor. For example if a school assignment is causing stress, taking a break from the assignment can be good. This break can include sleeping or engaging in hobbies. Physical activity and exercise reduce stress. Social support from friends and family can be helpful. Health care professionals can help when stress is bad and affects physical or mental health. Relaxing with meditation and deep breathing can also manage stress. "}

It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.\nAs a result of quantum fluctuations, particle-antiparticle pairs can appear from the vacuum of space near the event horizon of a black hole in which the net energy of the particles is zero due to the matter and antimatter nature of the particles. In normal conditions, particle-antiparticle pairs that appear due to the quantum fluctuations annihilate each other. But if one member of the pair falls beyond the event horizon of the black hole, the other particle will not have a sister with which to annihilate. The member that does not fall into the black hole is then emitted from the black hole as hawking radiation. The particle that falls into the black hole effectively has negative energy, meaning that it will subtract from the overall mass-energy content of the black hole. Thus, after enough time has passed, the black hole will evaporate from these negative particles, while seeming to emit positive ones. Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish.\nHawking radiation is such a small effect that it has never been measured. Micro black holes (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes (and should thus shrink and dissipate faster), but MBHs have yet to be observed. "}

In the 1980s it was made longer to join the southern exit at Launceston which connects to the Midland Highway. Almost the entire length of the highway has been re-aligned to allow for dual carriageway, overtaking lanes, and the bypass of small towns.\nBetween Launceston and Deloraine, this had included Carrick and Hadspen in the 1980s and Deloraine in the early 1990s. The longest stretch of highway, the Hagley-Westbury bypass, was completed in 2001. People living in the small towns have been concerned that they no longer get passing trade. The 'old' highway, now known as the Meander Valley Highway, is promoted as a tourist route.\nThe highway between Latrobe and Somerset has had a similar re-alignment. This section of the highway is more of a commuter highway than a tourist highway, and as such the local economy does not rely on passing tourists."}

The history of the name indicates that the etymology comes from the river Adige, with \"alto\" meaning upper, because the upper part of the river flows through the province. The name was first created by the Napoleonic French to distinguish (point out difference) this Italian-speaking area from the Austrian empire's Tyrol, directly north.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" was coined (created) in the late eighteenth century by Napoleon, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps.\nIn Italy, Alto Adige currently has the full name \"Provincia autonoma di Bolzano - Alto Adige\", but usually the name Alto Adige is used, since academic Ettore Tolomei made it official in Italy after the Great War.\nThis was the name of the French administrative division known as the \"Department of Alto Adige\" (\"Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige\"), created during Napoleon's \"Kingdom of Italy\" in 1810, which is related to the river Adige born in this province.\nToday it is the Italian name of the part of Tyrol that was south of the Brenner Pass. Together with Trentino it forms the Italian region Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol: legally the capital is Trento, but in practice, Bolzano also has this function.\nJust after WWII about sixty five percent of the population spoke German as their mother tongue, about a third spoke Italian, and about five percent spoke the Latin language. In the 2011 census the percentages were: 63%, 23% and 4% (another 10% are immigrants from outside Italy).\nNapoleon's Alto Adige and successive History.\nDuring French control of the region, South Tyrol was officially named \"Haut Adige\" to get rid of relation to the historic \"County of Tyrol\" of Austria.\nThe District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic.\nSome years later, Napoleon created the Department Alto Adige further north; this department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814.\nIt was created the Department of Alto Adige with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Germanized Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino).\nThe boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, saying that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians, according to the principle: \"belonging to the Kingdom of Italy because inhabited by Italians\" (\"\" ).\nThis shows that Bolzano was a mostly Italian town in Napoleonic times, and that in the following century was \"Germanized\" (as in the 1911 Austrian census, Bolzano was mostly German-speaking, at almost 91%).\nIndeed, between the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated by Latins from the time of Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanization. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present province of Bolzano (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin.\nAustria controlled the territory under the name of \"south Tyrol\" until 1918, performing a nearly complete Germanization policy during &amp; after the wars of the Italian independence. In 1866 the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph issued an order to make fully disappear the Italian community in the regions of Trentino-Alto Adige, Istria and Dalmatia.\n \nAfter the First World War, despite the fact that its inhabitants were almost entirely German-speaking, Alto Adige was assigned to the Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Saint-Germain . \nThis happened on the basis of the wishes of the Italian irredentists, who considered the Alto Adige as a geographical territory of Italy and based this on the fact that originally the territory had been mostly of \"Ladin language\" until the fourteenth century. \nBesides, the fascist government favored the industrialization of the province to attract Italian immigrants: as a result of this \"Italianisation\", today 135,000 people (almost a third of the total population) use Italian as mother tongue."}

He learned to speak English and was hired as a guide and interpreter. He taught the Pilgrims to plant corn. Squanto had much power among the Native Americans and the Pilgrims. He abused it, and barely escaped an Indian execution. He died in 1622 while making a trip around Cape Cod. \nEarly life.\nSquanto was born around 1580 in the area of present day Plymouth, Massachusetts. He was a member of the Paxutet people. Little is known about his early life. Squanto is thought to have been kidnapped as a young boy along the coast of Maine, and taken to England in 1605. He was taught English. He was hired as a guide and interpreter. He returned to his homeland with John Smith in 1614.\nKidnapping.\nIn 1614, Squanto and 23 other Indians were kidnapped by a lieutenant under Smith. This lieutenant sold him and the rest of the Indians as slaves in Malaga, Spain. Many historians have disputed what happened in this period of his life, as there is no written record. One theory is that once the Spanish found out these slaves were from the New World, Spanish friars rescued the remaining Indians, including Squanto, by purchasing them. They sent him on his way to England. It is not known what happened to the others. This is where he was taught English and the ways of the white man. He was employed by John Slaney of the Newfoundland Company, and was sent to Newfoundland around 1617, as an interpreter. He returned to his homeland in North America in 1619. \nPlymouth Colony.\nUpon Squanto's arrival, he discovered his people had been wiped out by disease; he was the sole survivor of the Paxutet people. The Wampanoag people adopted him, although not without hesitation. The chief, Massasoit was suspicious of Squanto due to his exposure with the white man and his new ability to speak their language. He knew Squanto's knowledge of English would help with trade, so he kept him.\nIn the spring of 1620, the made landfall in , then mainland. They set camp on the same grounds of Squanto's people--they called this colony, . After the harsh conditions of winter, about half of the colonists died. In the spring of 1621, an Indian who made friend with the English settlers, Samoset took Squanto to the Pilgrim settlement of Plymouth. Samoset could only speak broken English, while Squanto was seen as a master. Squanto was soon living with the people of Plymouth. \nHe joined them in meeting with Indian tribes. He helped to keep the peace. Tradition says he taught the Pilgrims to catch eels. William Bradford wrote that Squanto was of great help in the first year's spring planting of corn. He showed the Pilgrims both how to plant it and how to tend it. He showed them how to use fish as a fertilizer.\nOver the year, Squanto's power went to his head. He told the natives that he had the power to send the white man's plague or to make them attack.This was one of many shady deals he conducted with both the Pilgrims and the natives. He was found out, and barely escaped an Indian execution.\nDeath.\nIn November 1622, Squanto fell ill with a fever while on a trip around Cape Cod with William Bradford. He may have been poisoned by the Wampanoag. He bled at the nose, and said it was a certain sign of death. He asked Bradford to pray to the Christian god so he might enter Heaven. He gave some gifts to others. He died a few days later in what is now Chatham, Massachusetts.\nMovie.\nA Disney Movie loosely based on Squanto's Life: was released a year before Pocahontas. "}

It argues against the belief that most people with autism have low intelligence. Some people in the movement do not agree that this is true. There is fear that professionals, such as social workers, may try to prevent autistics from being married or having children. Also, people in the movement say that autistic people should not be treated differently from anyone else.\nThe movement has a variety of goals:\nAutism rights activists are sometimes called neurodiversity activists. Neurodiversity is a word for how everyone's brains are different. Autistic people have different brains to people who do not have autism. People who do not have autism are called neurotypical people. The word 'neurodiversity' is preferred to 'autism' because it is not saying that autism is a medical condition. 'Neurotypical' is said instead of 'normal' because people think that normal means better."}

The person's cancer may be far away from the mouth, or it may be in a part of the body that neighbors the mouth. For example, if a person has cancer of the nasal cavity, the cancer can spread to the mouth.\nTypes of Oral Cancers.\nThere are a few different types of oral cancers. But about 90% (9 in every 10 cases) are a type called squamous cell carcinomas. Squamous cells make up the main part of the outer layer of the skin. These cells line the lips, mouth, and throat.

For us, fresh water is drinkable, and sea water is not. This is because sea water has a high salt content, which humans (and many other land animals) cannot deal with. \nThere are arid and deserted areas, and places where the water is too polluted to drink. It is a social, environmental and economic problem in many countries. \nWater scarcity can be the result of both human and natural causes. Changes in climate and weather patterns can cause the availability of water to drop. Common human causes include over-consumption, bad governance, pollution, and increases in the demand for water.\nDifferent terms are used to describe different types of water scarcity:\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with total water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. The World Bank has said that climate change could heavily change the future of water availability and use, and therefore increase water stress on a global scale.\nFresh water scarcity has negative affects on ecology, biodiversity, agriculture and human health. It has also led to armed conflicts in several cases. Some countries upriver have built dams to satisfy their needs for drinking water, irrigation and electric power. These needs have grown as populations has grown, and as climate changes has reduced rain in some places. Down river from the dam, supply is usually reduced. This creates tension between countries. The River Jordan in the Middle East, and the Nile are two good examples of where this is happening. "}

It was a palace for the kings and queens of Hawaii. It is the only palace in the United States that was used as an official residence by a reigning monarch. Two monarchs governed from Iolani Palace. They were King Kal\u0101kaua and Queen Liliuokalani. After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the building was used as the state's capitol building until 1969.\nIn 1962, Iolani Palace became a National Historic Landmark. The palace was restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1978.\nHistory.\nRoyal palace.\nIolani Palace was built when the king of Hawaii was David Kal\u0101kaua. Kal\u0101kaua had seen royal palaces in Europe. He had Iolani Palace designed to be like those. It was built of brick and concrete. The building was completed in November 1882. It cost over $340,000. It measures about . It is two stories high. It has a basement. It has four corner towers. It has two towers in the center that are high.\nIolani Palace is the only building of its architectural style. The style is called \"American Florentine\". The palace had electricity and telephones even before the White House had them.\nExecutive Building.\nAfter Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the new government of Hawaii took over Iolani Palace. The palace was renamed the \"Executive Building\" for the Republic of Hawaii. Officials made a record of what was in the building. The things that could not be used by the new government were sold at public auctions.\nQueen Liliuokalani was imprisoned for nine months in a small room on the upper floor after a rebellion in 1895. The quilt she made is still there.\nPalace Restoration.\nIn 1930, the inside of Iolani Palace was remodeled. The wood framing was replaced by steel and reinforced concrete. In 1935, the name was changed back to Iolani Palace.\nIolani Palace was made an official National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962. On October 15, 1966, it was added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu. Government offices left the Palace in 1969 and moved to the new Hawaii State Capitol building.\nMany things that used to be in the palace have been returned. Money from the government and private donations paid to help make rooms in the palace look like they did during the monarchy era. Iolani Palace opened to the public in 1978. In the basement is a photographic display of the Palace, the Hawaiian crown jewels, awards given by the monarchs, and regalia worn by the high chiefs of the islands.\nThe grounds of Iolani Palace are managed by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. The palace building itself is managed as a historical house museum by the Friends of Iolani Palace, a non-profit non-governmental organization. The birthdays of King Kal\u0101kaua (November 16) and Queen Kapiolani (December 28) are celebrated with ceremonies."}

It is a white paint mixture. It has a binder mixed with a pigment. Traditionally, the binder is glue or gelatin, the pigment is chalk, plaster or gypsum. \nGesso is used in art to prepare a surfaces (wood panels, canvas and sculpture) for painting. Paint and/or other materials are applied on top of the gesso. One reason for covering the surface with gesso is that wood or canvas has a rough or uneven surface, and a colour. Gesso \"priming\" lets the artist's chosen subject show more clearly than it would otherwise. \nEven if a surface has no roughness, many artists still prime it before starting the painting proper, though they might use a paint or \"wash\" of their own choosing. They do this because the primer, though it cannot be seen directly, may change and help the quality of light reflected from the surface. Gesso, however, is specially useful for a rough or uneven surface. \nAcrylic gesso.\nAcrylic gesso, a widely used \"ground\", is a modern version which is cheaper and easier to use than the traditional type of gesso. It is a combination of calcium carbonate with an acrylic polymer medium latex, a pigment and other chemicals to ensure flexibility and increase life. It is technically not \"gesso\" at all.p321\n\"The Painter's Handbook\" notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility over time that could cause the oil paint to delaminate (flake off).p60"}

The Archimedes screw is still much in use all over the world.\nThere is also a kind of reverse Archimedes' screw. Water poured in on top turns the screw.

In an early Greek translation of the bible, the Septuagint, the name is written as \"Esdras\" (), from which comes . His name may be an abbreviation of \"\", \"God-helps\".\nIn Islam he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an.\nEarly bible history.\nThe \"Book of Ezra\" and \"Book of Nehemiah\" are the oldest sources for the history of Ezra. Many of the other books they say are written by Ezra (First Esdras, 3-6 Ezra) are written after that. Those books take the story from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\nEzra was a member of the family of Seraiah the high priest. He lived in Babylon when in the seventh year (~ 457 BCE) of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them.\nEzra led a large group of exiles back to Jerusalem. He discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He worked to stop this from happening again.\nSome years later the king Artaxerxes sent a Jewish nobleman, Nehemiah, to Jerusalem. He had to rebuild the city walls. Once this was done, Nehemiah asked Ezra to read the Law of Moses (the Torah) to the people. The people and priests agreed to keep to this law and to separate themselves from all other peoples.\nLater literature.\nThe second book of Esdras was written a lot later, c. AD 100. In this book, Ezra talks with an angel or God three times and has four visions. At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.\nEzra in rabbinic literature.\nJudaism believes Ezra started the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets. Later, this would become the Sanhedrin, the authority when it comes to religious law.\nIt is said that Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles.\nEzra's tomb.\nHis tomb at Al-\u02bbUzair on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs."}

It is a nearly complete skeleton of a hominid who died in the early Pleistocene 1.5 million years ago (mya), near present-day Lake Turkana in northwest Kenya. This specimen is the \"most complete early human skeleton ever found\". It was first classified as \"Homo erectus\"; after much heated debate, it was re-classified as \"Homo ergaster\".\nHis age at death has been estimated from 7 years six months to as old as 15 years. The most recent scientific review suggests 8 years of age. It was first thought that he would have grown to 1.85 m tall, but recently a height of 1.63 m was proposed. Research showed that his growth differed from that of modern humans: he would have had a shorter and smaller adolescent growth spurt.\nThe skeleton was discovered in 1984 by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of a team led by Richard Leakey, at Nariokotome near Lake Turkana in northwest Kenya.\nAdolescence and maturity.\nThe shape of the pelvis identifies that the specimen was a male. His estimated age at death depends upon whether the maturity stage of his teeth or skeletal is used, and whether that maturity is compared to that of modern humans or chimpanzees.\nA key factor here is that while modern humans have a marked adolescent growth spurt, chimpanzees do not. While initial research assumed a modern human type of growth, more recent evidence from other fossils suggests this was less present in early \"Homo\". This affects the estimation of both his age and his likely stature as a fully grown adult.\nMorphology.\nThe pelvis is narrower than in \"Homo sapiens\", which might indicate more efficient running, whether to run down small game or to avoid predators. The Boy was relatively tall, which would have increased his surface area and helped him to lose heat.\nBody hair may also have been thinner to hasten cooling. Body hair was lost in the shift towards savanna living. In equatorial Africa, modern humans evolved this trait an estimated one million years ago.\nThe skeleton still had features (such as a low sloping forehead, strong brow ridges, and the absence of a chin) not seen in \"H. sapiens\". The arms were slightly longer. Turkana Boy had a projecting nose rather than the open flat nose seen in apes."}

It is one of the 24 Chopin preludes. This is the longest of the preludes. It lasts between five and seven minutes. The prelude is famous for its repeating A-flat. This note appears throughout the piece. It sounds like raindrops to many listeners. It is known for it's repetitive raindrop motif.\nComposition.\nSome of the Preludes were written during Chopin and George Sand's stay at a monastery in Valldemossa, Majorca in 1838. In her \"Histoire de ma vie\", Sand told how one evening she and her son Maurice, returning from Palma, Majorca, in a terrible rainstorm, found a frantic Chopin who cried, \"Ah! I knew well that you were dead.\" While playing his piano he had a dream:\n\"He saw himself drowned in a lake. Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast, and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof, he denied having heard it. He was even angry that I should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds. He protested with all his might \u2013 and he was right to \u2013 against the childishness of such aural imitations. His genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature, but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought, and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds.\"\nSand did not say which prelude Chopin played for her at that time. Most music critics think it was no. 15, because of the repeating A flat, with its suggestion of the \"gentle patter\" of rain. Peter Dayan points out that Sand accepted Chopin's protests that the prelude was not an \"imitation\" of the sound of raindrops, but a \"translation\" of nature's harmonies within Chopin's \"g\u00e9nie\". Frederick Niecks says that the prelude \"rises before one's mind the cloistered court of the monastery of Valdemosa, and a procession of monks chanting lugubrious prayers, and carrying in the dark hours of night their departed brother to his last resting-place.\nDescription.\nThe prelude opens with a \"serene\" theme in D flat. It then changes to a \"lugubrious interlude\" in C sharp minor, \"with the dominant pedal never ceasing, a basso ostinato\". The repeating A flat, which has been heard throughout the first section, here becomes more insistent. Following this, the prelude ends with a repetition of the original theme. Niecks says, \"This C sharp minor portion...affects one like an oppressive dream; the re-entrance of the opening D flat major, which dispels the dreadful nightmare, comes upon one with the smiling freshness of dear, familiar nature \u2013 only after these horrors of the imagination can its serene beauty be fully appreciated."}

The influence extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena (effects). It is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). \nIn the original Newtonian concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Newton, Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid. Since the 19th century explanations for gravity have in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. This revolution was brought about by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Most scientists believe that the gravitational field and its gravitational waves are the physical interpretations of Einstein's equations of general relativity.\nIn a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the mass of objects distort spacetime. This distortion is what is perceived and measured as a \"force\". In such a model matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime. One can say either \"there is no gravitational force\", or that \"gravity is a fictitious force\"."}

For this reason, the number of recognised species varies between 260, and 860. Most people think there are about 750 species."}

Natural resources, such as clean water are limited, because of pollution. They are also seen as \"free\" public goods. This means that if there are no rules on how to use these goods, they will be used too much. There are externalities for using these goods, and there is the problem of free riders. In this perspective, the solution is to convert these resources into economic goods, which are integrated in the market. This will lessen the problem of free-riding, and give incentives to use these goods sparingly. An example for this is a tax which is tied to pollution. Proper legislation and observation of property right on how to regulate the use of these public goods is also another important factor in ensuring that market inefficiencies don't result."}

Free riding may be considered as a free rider problem when it leads to under-provision of goods or services, or when it leads to overuse or degradation of a common property resource. \nAlthough the term originated in economic theory, similar concepts have been cited in political science, social psychology, and other disciplines. Some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride."}

Mujib visited Moscow in 1972, and high-level officials from both countries made numerous reciprocal visits until 1975. The Soviets supported the socialist programs of the Mujib government and its very exceptionally close ties with India. Early Soviet aid was limited, however. During the first four months of its existence, Bangladesh received economic aid worth US$142 million from India, but only US$6 million from the Soviet Union.\nIt also believed that the Communist Party of Bangladesh was funded and supported in the erstwhile volatile region of the former \"East Pakistan\" since then it was part of a United Pakistan itself allied with the United States and the China which were hostile towards rival Soviet Union, the party itself was based on the idealogical principals of Marxism.\nBangladeshi-Soviet relations rapidly improved in 1984 and regained a level of cordiality in the mid- and late 1980s. In 1985 the Soviet Cultural Centre reopened in Dhaka. In 1986 a Soviet special envoy visited Dhaka, and later the Bangladeshi foreign minister visited Moscow. Although Soviet aid to Bangladesh was still small compared with assistance from Japan, the United States, or even China, by 1987 Bangladesh had entered into sixteen different economic accords with the Soviet Union. Soviet assistance has concentrated on the energy sector, especially several power plants at Ghorasal, near Dhaka."}

It was not reprinted in Russia until 1966.\n\"The Day of the Turbins\".\nAfter the first two parts of \"The White Guard\" were published in \"Rossiya\", Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play \"The Days of the Turbins.\" This was produced at the Moscow Art Theatre, to great acclaim:\nIn fact, the play completely overshadowed the book, which was in any event virtually unobtainable in any form.\nSince Bulgakov was refused permission to publish his most important works, he pleaded with Stalin to be allowed to leave the country. Stalin personally arranged for a job for him at the Moscow Arts Theatre. Bulgakov was still writing and re-writing his uncompleted novel, \"The Master And Margarita\", when he died in 1940.\nHis widow had \"The White Guard\" published in large part in the literary journal \"Moskva\" in 1966, at the end of the Krushchev era.

Historical figures such as Petlyura and Pavlo Skoropadsky appear as the Turbin family is caught up in the effects of the October Revolution.\nAutobiographical elements.\nThe novel contains many autobiographical elements. Bulgakov gave the younger Turbin brother some of the characteristics of his own younger brother. The description of the house of the Turbins is that of the house of the Bulgakov family in Kiev.

It is often used to illustrate a chaotic system. The BZR is made of several chemical reactions, that occur in sequence. It shows chemical oscillation, which is unusual for chemical reactions. At first it was thought to be a measurement error, or an artifact. It was thought that according to the Second law of thermodynamics, this should not occur. According to this law, a system that is in an unordered state will not assume an ordered state on its own, that is without the provision of energy. However, this is only applicable in a closed system, and does not apply to the BZ reaction.\nThe reactions are theoretically important because they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior. These reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time. In this sense, they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena. The mathematical models of the BZ reactions themselves are of theoretical interest.\nAn essential aspect of the BZ reaction is called\"excitability\": under the influence of stimuli, patterns develop in what would otherwise be a perfectly calm medium. Some clock reactions such as Briggs\u2013Rauscher and BZ using the tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride as catalyst can be made to show self-organising activity through the influence of light.\nSimilar processes were already known in the 19th century. Wilhelm Ostwald gave a detailed account in 1899 and 1900, describing the oscillations of Chrome in Hydrochloric acid and of iron in Nitric acid. Boris Pavlovich Belousov accidentally discovered the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction in the 1950s. Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. His research focused on systems which were far away from an equilibrium state, the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction was included. Beloussow was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1980, after his death. The Lenin prize was the highest distinction for scientific achievement in the Soviet Union."}

He became a respected church deacon and the physician for Plymouth Colony.\nFuller was a son of Robert Fuller, a butcher. He was baptized on January 20, 1580 at Redenhall, co. Norfolk, England. He was a member of the Separatist religion which was not allowed in England.\nIn 1610, Fuller moved to Leiden, Netherlands. He was a friend of Degory Priest and Sarah Allerton. Sarah was the sister of Isaac Allerton. Fuller was an active church congregation member. In Leiden records Fuller was referred to as \u201ca serge worker of London.\u201d \nSamuel\u2019s wife and son died in 1615 and he married Bridget Lee.\nSamuel Fuller helped to plan for the Separatists to move to the Colony of Virginia. They made an agreement with the Virginia Company. Fuller, along with Edward Winslow, William Bradford and Isaac Allerton, sent a letter on June 10, 1620 to John Carver and Robert Cushman. These men were in London and were also making plans for the voyage. They learned that Thomas Weston and the Company had changed the agreement. One of the changes was that the merchants would keep half of the houses and lands. The pilgrims would also have one day off from work per week. These problems were not solved until Robert Cushman arrived in the \"Fortune\" in November 1621.\nSamuel Fuller learned about medicine before he traveled to the New World so that he could help the others if needed. There would be no doctor on the \"Mayflower\" or at Plymouth Colony.\nIt is said that the town of Fullerton, North Dakota, is named after Samuel Fuller.\n\"Mayflower\" Voyage.\nSamuel Fuller boarded the \"Mayflower\" with only his servant William Butten, leaving his wife behind in Leiden until he could get settled. William Butten died before the \"Mayflower\" landed.\nThe Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" spotted land. They landed on 21 November and wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in the Colony of Virginia, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.\nPlymouth Colony.\nSamuel's wife came on the ship \"Anne\" and in a few years Samuel would receive two acres of Land. His wife Bridget received one acre of land near a pond. In 1627, Samuel and his wife received several livestock for their farm.\nIn 1629, a group of people arrived led by John Endicott. They became sick and Fuller was sent to assist them. Endicott sent a letter of thanks to William Bradford. He also helped people at Charleston when they were sick.\nNot everyone thought Fuller was a good doctor. In 1637, Thomas Morton, wrote a letter calling Fuller a quacksalver which is where the word \"quack\" comes from. \nIn the summer of 1633, Fuller fell ill with a sickness that had spread through Plymouth. Author Nathaniel Morton wrote about Samuel Fuller\u2019s in his 1669 New England\u2019s Memorial. He praised Fuller and his work.\nFuller was married two times. He married Sarah Dunthorne who died in England in 1584. His second wife was Bridget Lee who died in 1667. He and Bridget had four children: Mercy and Samuel, Jr., unknown female and Elizabeth.\nSamuel Fuller made out his will in 1633. He said he was sick and weak. Samuel Fuller died in 1633.\nThe burial place of Samuel Fuller is unknown."}

Airbus Industries launched the plane in 1972, and it was the first plane with two engines to have more than one aisle between the seats (the first twin-engined wide-body aircraft). The A300 can hold 266 passengers in two classes. It can fly for a maximum of when it is full, but this depends on the type of A300.\nAir France was the first airline to get an A300. Air France began to use its A300s on 30 May 1974. Airbus stopped making A300s in July 2007. When Airbus stopped making A300s, it also stopped making A310s. The freighter version of the A300 has been replaced by the A330-200F.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1966, Frank Kolk, a member of American Airlines, asked for a plane to replace the Boeing 727. He wanted a plane which could hold 250 to 300 passengers, with two engines. American plane makers made planes with three engines, like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, because the FAA had banned planes with two engines from flying on certain routes.\nIn September 1967, the British, French, and German governments agreed to begin designing the Airbus A300, which would have 300 seats.\nAfter this agreement, both the French and British governments were worried about the plane. The plane needed a new type of engine from Rolls-Royce, the RB207. In December 1968, the French and British companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) thought of a different design: the Airbus A250, which would have 250 seats. This design had its name changed to the A300B, and it did not need a new type of engine, which saved money. To get more U.S. airlines to buy the plane, American General Electric CF6-50 engines were used for the A300 instead of Rolls-Royce engines. The British government was upset and decided to stop supporting the A300. However, Hawker-Siddeley did not leave, and designed the wings for the A300.\nIn 1972, the A300 flew for the first time. The first type of A300 to be made, the A300B2, began to be used by airlines in 1974. The A300B4 began to be used one year later. At first, Airbus Industrie did not sell many planes. However, by 1979, 81 aircraft were being used. It was the A320 which made Airbus the very big company that it is today.\nParts of the A300 were made by many different companies from all over Europe. These were taken to Toulouse-Blagnac by some Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft so that the parts could all be put together to make the plane. This method turned out to be much better than simply building the aircraft in one place. (Source?)\nDesign.\nSome of the technology used for the Airbus A300 was taken from Concorde. When it began being used in 1974, the A300 was an advanced plane. Some advanced features were:\nA300s made later have other features, like:\nHistory.\nThe A300 did not sell very well at first. Most of the orders were from airlines of countries which made up Airbus Industrie, like Air France and Lufthansa.\nIn 1974, Korean Air ordered 4 A300s. This made it the first airline outside of Europe to order an Airbus Industrie plane. Airbus Industrie thought that South-East-Asia was a good place to sell planes. It also thought that Korean Air was the 'key' to selling planes in that area.\nAirlines which used the A300 to fly on short flights needed to have fewer flights so that the aircraft could be filled, so these airlines lost customers to other airlines which used smaller aircraft and had flights more often. Eventually, Airbus had to make the A320 to rival the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80.\nIn 1977, Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s. Frank Borman, who was the CEO of Eastern, was happy that the A300 used much less fuel than the planes the airline already had. He ordered 23 A300s. After this, Pan Am also ordered some A300s. From then on, many A300s were sold, and 878 planes were given to airlines.\nThe body of the A300 was made longer (on the A330 and A340), shorter (on the A310), or was changed (for the A300-600ST \"Beluga\" Super Transporter).\nIn March 2006, Airbus said that it was no longer making the A300/A310. The last A300 first flew on 18 April 2007. It was delivered to FedEx on 12 July 2007.\nDifferent types of Airbus A300.\nA300B1.\nOnly two of these were built: the prototype, and a second aircraft. It can hold 300 passengers or 323 passengers, and it has two General Electric CF6-50A engines.\nA300B2.\nThe first version to be made for airlines. It had General Electric CF6 or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. Air France was the first airline to use it, in May 1974.\nA300B4.\nThe version which was made the most. The first A300B4 made its first flight on 25 December 1974. Germanair got the first one on 23 May 1975.\nA300-600.\nThis type's official name is the A300B4-600. It has more powerful CF6-80 or Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines, and it has the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). The A300-600 began being used in 1983 by Saudi Arabian Airlines The A300-600 also has a different cockpit (similar to the A310), so the flight engineer was not needed for this type.\nA300B10 (A310).\nThis type is shorter and does not need a flight engineer. \nIt can also be used as a military plane. It is currently being used by the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. 260 of these planes were sold, but five of these were never made.\nAccidents.\nAs of 2010, the A300 has had 54 accidents. There have been 26 hull-losses. 1,434 people have died on A300s. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is completely destroyed, or if it is damaged so much that it cannot be fixed.\nAircraft still flying.\nAs of July 2020, there are more than 200 A300s still flying.\nDetails.\nSources:"}

Nerve cells use electricity to transmit information. It is one of the methods of diagnosis which can be used for conditions that affect the nerves. An electroencephalogram is a recorded electroencephalography. Both are abbreviated EEG. Electroencephalography is used to detect epilepsy, coma, sleep and brain death. Special adaptations exists to research sleep, for example the length of sleep rhythms. Sleep occurs in different phases, the specially adapted EEG can show the length of these phases.\nEEG waves.\nOne way that scientists study EEG recordings is by looking at different waves in the EEG. These waves do not move across the body, but occur as changes in the signal at one place over time. They are studied using mathematical techniques for separating a signal into different frequencies. The slowest waves are called delta, and they occur at 1 to 4 cycles per second. Delta occurs in sleep and during anesthesia. The next frequency is called theta, and it occurs at 4 to 8 cycles per second. Theta is seen when a person is trying to keep many different things, such as numbers or words, in memory. It is also seen when a person is drowsy. After theta comes alpha, a wave occurring at 8 to 12 cycles per second. Alpha is seen over the back of the head when a person has his or her eyes shut. It is also seen when a person is resting or meditating. Faster than alpha is beta, a wave that occurs at 12 to 30 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is getting ready to move or no longer resting. It is also seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs. Finally, gamma is the fastest wave seen in EEG, occurring at 30 to 100 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is thinking or paying attention to something. "}

The regional languages are sometimes recognized and protected by the regional government or the state: many states across the world recognize regional languages, and give them a status, as is the case, for example, of Wallonia, Spain, Italy or Switzerland. In other cases the state does not grant official status as an official language of the country; it is the case with the regional languages of France, which can be studied but cannot be used in the government or any public service, where only French is official.\nStatus and trends.\nIn some cases, a regional language may be the main or official language of another country; that is the case, in Europe, of French in the Valle d'Aosta, or Slovene in Austria.\nStatus changes may take place either by laws within a state or is by political and territorial changes.\nAn example of the first case is Belgium, where only the French was the official language since the independence in 1831. In 1878, it was allowed that the provinces and districts where Flemish was spoken to use either French or Flemish; then, in 1938, Flemish became the official language of the northern part of Belgium.\nFor the second case, an example is the fragmentation of the Soviet Union where some regional languages, such as Latvian, Romanian or Georgian, became official languages in the new states formed after the fragmentation: Latvia, Moldova and Georgia.\nIn a federal state, an official language in a province, region or state, can be a regional language in other parts. That is the case, for example, in Canada, where the French is the official language in the province of Quebec but is a regional one in other provinces."}

It is the dialect spoken in Cuba. It shares many of the same features as other Caribbean dialects of Spanish.\nMuch of Cuban Spanish derives from the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands of Spain. This is because large numbers of Canarian people moved to Cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries. People from other Spanish communities, such as Galicians, Catalans, Basques and Asturians, also moved here, but did not have as much influence on the language as the Canarians did. Many words in Cuban Spanish come from the Canarian dialect, but some words are from other parts of Spain. There are also words that come from West African languages, French, or from the indigenous Ta\u00edno language.\nThe language is spoken differently from east to west. The eastern part of the island had large plantations where many African slaves worked during the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, the east has a stronger influence from African languages (such as Yoruba and Kikongo) than the west. It is closer to Dominican Spanish than to the Spanish spoken in the western part of the island. The Haitian Creole language influenced the eastern Cuban culture after the Haitian Revolution. Some words of the eastern dialect can be traced back to Haitian Creole words used every day locally. Some Cubans can still speak Haitian Creole."}

He is considered one of Scotland's greatest heroes. He was a follower and close friend of king Robert I of Scotland (also called Robert the Bruce).\nEarly life.\nJames Douglas was the oldest son of William, Lord of Douglas and Elizabeth Stewart. His father, William, had refused to support king Edward I of England who had taken over Scotland in 1290. The English king put William in prison and took his lands. This left young James with no land and no father. Douglas then went to France where he lived a simple life for three years. On hearing of his father's death he returned to Scotland and went to see William of Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. The bishop took James in and in due time Bishop Lamberton took James to see King Edward I of England. When the bishop asked for the lands of Douglas to be returned to James, the king grew angry and said no. The lordship of Douglas had been given to Robert Clifford and the king would hear no more of the matter. Douglas remained in the service of the bishop and did nothing to rebel against the king of England. He hoped to get his family's lands returned to him. But in 1306 Robert the Bruce claimed the crown of Scotland as king Robert I. Now Douglas had a choice between two kings who might restore his lands.\nJoins Robert the Bruce.\nIn 1307 Douglas joined king Robert against the English king, Edward I That spring James Douglas with some of his men attacked his father's castle of Douglas and defeated the English soldiers there. Douglas then burned his castle and destroyed all stores of wine and grain. He poisoned the wells and executed the English soldiers they . This event became known as Douglas' larder. Even though Douglas did not yet possess his father's lands he had influence in that region. He and his men of Douglas harried the English forces in the region all that summer. The tactics used by Bruce and his followers including Douglas were limited to surprise attacks and quick escapes. They burned enemy lands and rendered castles they captured useless to the English. On learning the Earl of Pembroke was moving a large army into Scotland, Douglas went to warn Robert Bruce. Bruce and Douglas split up and agreed to meet at another place. When they rejoined their forces they attacked the English and defeated them.\nThe Black Douglas.\nIn several raids in 1307 and 1308 James Douglas provided support to King Robert in the south of Scotland. On the night of Tuesday 19 February 1314 James Douglas and his men wearing black coats to cover their armor attacked Roxbrugh Castle. Roxbrugh was the main English stronghold in south central Scotland. It was defended by 100 English soldiers. The fall of Roxbrugh Castle caused many in the area to flee back to England. Now held by Douglas it was the beginning of his reputation as \"the Black Douglas\". To the people of Scotland he was the \"the Good Sir James\". He was now one of the king's greatest supporter and a model of chivalry. But James had black hair and a reputation so feared by the English they named him \"the Black Douglas.\" They said his evil success against them was because he was a demon himself. His son and grandson also used the feared name themselves continuing the family reputation.\nBattle of Bannockburn.\nEdward II of England had kept up the wars against the Bruce and his followers. He was growing more and more angry with each victory of Robert the Bruce and his followers. Determined to put an end to Bruce once and for all he assembled a very large army. It consisted of mounted knights, archers, crossbow-men, and foot soldiers led by Edward himself. the exact size of his army is unknown, but it was several times larger than that of Robert the Bruce. King Robert chose the place for the upcoming battle at Bannockburn very carefully He chose a position with several natural defenses many of which prevented heavy cavalry or large mass formations to operate. He formed his army into four 'battles' or Battalions, three of which consisted of 'hedgehog' or schiltrons Just before the battle began king Robert knighted Sir James Douglas, his cousin Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and many others. James and Walter were joint leaders of the left battalion.\nWhen the English army was still approaching, king Robert sent Douglas and Sir Robert Keith, Marischal of Scotland to observe the English and report back to him. Douglas and Keith reported king Edward was approaching with a very large army. During the battle most of the fighting was directed at the other two battalions. When the center battalion led by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was in trouble, Douglas went to their rescue of his close friend. But the English retreated before Douglas could help. Finally the Scots won the battle and the English fell back in confusion, king Edward with 500 mounted knights fled the field. James Douglas with a small mounted force gave chase to the English king. They chased them all the way to Dunbar, but Edward escaped back to England.\nBorder raids.\nAfter English defeat at Bannockburn the northern border of England was very lightly defended. In August of 1314 James Douglas, along with Edward Bruce (the king's brother), and John of Soules led a large raid into England. From 1314 to 1319 Douglas was raiding northern England at least once a year. When Edward Bruce left for Ireland in 1317 Douglas took his place as leader in the south of Scotland. These raids were not just to frighten the English but to get cash payment for king of Scotland for not attacking that village. It was also to prove to the English that their king Edward II could not protect them. Douglas was the one of the main leader in the wars on the English border until the final peace in 1328.\nTwo times, in 1319 and in 1322, when Douglas raided into Yorkshire he tried to capture King Edward II and his wife Queen Isabella of France. While he did not succeed this only added to his reputation by the English as \"the Black Douglas.\" On 25 December 1319 the Scots and English signed a two year truce. In 1320, James Douglas put his seal on the Declaration of Arbroath. This declaration of Scottish independence was in the form of a letter to Pope John XXII.\nDuring this period Douglas was rewarded many times with grants of lands. One grant was not of land but of privileges. Called the Emerald Charter, it gave James Douglas and his heirs freedom from many obligations to the king. It also made Douglas and his heirs a judge in their own lands. In giving James Douglas this special grant the king took an emerald ring from his finger and placed it on Douglas' finger. His importance to King Robert and to Scotland was increasing as time went on. \nHeart of the Bruce.\nIn 1328 Robert the Bruce was in poor health and was dying. One thing he had not been able to do was to go on a crusade. He asked his friend Sir James Douglas to take his heart to the Holy Land. The king died on 7 June 1329. After the king's death James Douglas had a silver casket made and placed in it the heart of Robert the Bruce. He kept it safe on a chain around his neck. In 1330 he and six knights set out in a ship with royal banners. This is so all who saw it would know the heart of Robert, King of Scotland was on its way to Jerusalem in the Holy Land. The ship waited at Sluys, Flanders for other knights to join them before continuing on their voyage. They sailed to Spain where they stopped at Seville. They were welcomed by Alfonso XI, King of Castile and Leon as well as many English knights who had come to Spain to fight against the Moors. In August 1330 outside the walls of the Moorish town of Teba de Ardales Douglas and his knights joined the king's army. King Alfonso asked Douglas if he would lead the vanguard and placed all the English and Scottish knights under his command. Douglas ordered the charge and the fighting began right away. When the moors pretended to retreat, Douglas and ten of his knights chased after them. But it was a trick and the Moors turned and surrounded them. Trying to rescue a fellow knight Douglas and all his knights were killed. Sir James Douglas was found with the silver casket still around his neck. His body was made ready for the trip home. The silver casket containing the heart of Bruce never reached the Holy Land. It was buried at the Abbey of Melrose. Sir James Douglas was buried at the Kirk of Douglas.\nReferences.\n "}

The word is also used for people who never had this sense. The loss can be temporary, or permanent. The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include:\nSmelling things depends on two nerves (Nervus olfactorius and Nervus trigeminus), as well as the part of the brain which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small.\nThere are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem.\nThe sense of smell also affects the sense of taste. People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.\nNote also that the sense of smell changes with age. Anosmia can also point to different neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease,\nAlzheimer's disease, or Schizophrenia. Certain plants, such as tobacco also contain substances which change olfaction.\nIn general, anosmia which has its cause in the brain cannot be treated. Anosmia which is caused by blocking the nose can be treated by removing the block. In some cases, accupuncture was successfully used to treat anosmia.\nAnosmia Causes.\nNasal congestion from a cold, allergy, sinus infection, or poor air quality is the most common cause of anosmia. Other anosmia causes include:"}

It was one of the most popular daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years. The \"Post\" was founded in November 1831 by two businessmen: Charles G. Greene and William Beals. By the 1930s, \"The Boston Post\" had grown to be one of the largest newspapers in the country, with well over a million readers.\nDuring the 1940s, the newspaper faced more and more competition from papers published by William Hearst. More people began listening to the news on radio and television, and the paper's business began to suffer. It stopped being published in October 1956. At the time, it was printing about 255,000 copies of its daily issue, and about 260,000 of its Sunday edition.\nSunday magazine.\nIn the Sunday paper every week was included a weekly magazine. It was originally called \"The Sunday Magazine of \"The Boston Sunday Post\" and later \"The Boston Sunday Post\" Sunday Magazine\".\n\"Boston Post\" Cane.\nThe \"Boston Post\" Cane was an award given by many New England towns to their oldest citizen. It was originally done in 1909, when the newspaper was owned by Edwin A. Grozier. The newspaper had several hundred ornate, gold-tipped canes made, and then given presented in a ceremony to each town's oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930. Many towns in New England still carry on the \"Boston Post\" cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909. When a recipient dies (or leaves the community), the cane passes to a successor who is the town's next oldest living resident."}

Sometimes there may be extra members in the team, including someone to secure and the team's position, and to communicate with other teams. This third member is known as the flanker.\nThe spotter finds, watches, and assigns targets, and also watches to see whether the shot has hit or missed the target. They use a specialised telescope to do this. They also make calculations for distance and angle, and try to read the direction and strength of the wind. This is so that the sniper can make adjustments to the aim to make the shot more accurate.\nAs well as their long-range rifle, a sniper team is usually armed with a shorter-ranged weapon. This is to defend the team in case enemies come in close contact. Equally important is remaining hidden from view. Teams use camouflage, and choose locations where there is something for them to hide behind."}

It is a track on their album, \"Take Me Home\". The song was written by Peter Svensson, Sam Hollander, Lukasz Gottwald, Henry Walter and Allan Grigg, and was produced by Dr. Luke, Circut and Kool Kojak. The song includes a mid-tempo beat, with it's clapping riff to be the same as the song \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen. The song has gotten good reviews from critics. They liked how good the production was and its rock elements. \"Rock Me\" also made it on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \nBackground.\n\"Rock Me\" was made in one day by guitar player Peter Svensson of the Swedish band the Cardigans, Sam Hollander, and Allan 'Kool Kojak' Grigg. It was made for One Direction's second album, \"Take Me Home\". The album was released in November 2012. Grigg started out with making a mid-tempo beat. Svensson has said that Hollander \"had an idea for a title that's like 'rock me' instead of \u2018rock you,\u2019 and the melody just came.\" Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Circut' Walter co-produced the song, and they were also credited as on the finished recording too.\nMusic and words.\n\"Rock Me\" is a mid-tempo pop rock song. Both \"Billboard\" and BBC Music said that the song went away from One Direction's signature bubblegum pop sound. One Direction's voice ranges from F4 to C6. Instruments like guitar strings, and piano lines also play in the song. The song is in the key of Ab major. The time signature is common time and the tempo is a moderate 84 beats per minute. \nCritics have also said that the song has beat and clapping riff, the same as Queen's \"We Will Rock You\". The song's chorus also references Queen: \"I want you to rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care.\" The lyrics has a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, \"but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's not a lot of overt machismo in the song\". \"I approached it like high school,\" said Hollander, who wrote lyrics for \"Rock Me\": \"On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver\u2019s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture.\"\nCritical reception.\nAlexis Petridis, a writer of \"The Guardian\", gave criticism for the song as \"excruciating\". He said that the lyrics are tedious and uninspiring. \"The New Zealand Herald\" writer Lydia Jenkin deemed \"Rock Me\" one of \"the most banal songs ever written\", but noted that the group \"know what teenage girls want to hear.\" Idolator critic Sam Lansky praised the track as \"irresistible\" and commended its sonic palette as \"explosively punchy\". Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman favoured its \"nearly hypnotic anthemic\" beat, and noted that \"Rock Me\" seems perfectly tailored to become a live staple. Ben Rayner of the \"Toronto Star\" thought the song's Queen-references are \"clever\", assessing: \"to show that One Direction\u2019s puppeteers aren't totally operating on autopilot.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy opined that the song's \"simple-yet-genius catchiness\" is its strongest attribute. \"Billboard\" reviewer Chris Payne applauded its rock elements, regarding it as \"welcome\" deviation from \"Take Me Home\"'s bubblegum pop sound.\nChart performance.\nIn the week of 18 November 2012, \"Rock Me\" started at number one on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart due to very high digital download sales. As a result of an \"end-of-year download rush\" in the week ending 30 December 2012, the track made it on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 98. 98 was the song's peak position on the chart. "}

Orpheus decided to ride the ferry across the river Styx. He played his harp to make Cerberus fall asleep. He played his harp for Persephone. She said he could take Eurydice back to the upper world, if he didn't look back at Eurydice until they both got back up to the land of mortals. He did look back when he got to the upper world but his wife was not in the upper world yet so she went back to the realm of Hades forever. He was killed by Maenad.\nSome more clarification on the Maenads: They were feral women who ritualistically ripped animals limb from limb, and they did so with Orpheus after trying to kill him with spears and rocks. They cast his head into the sea. It rolled along the waves, singing, \"Eurydice, Eurydice\". It approached Lesbos and landed there, just to be attacked further by a snake. \nApollo cleared things up, and turned the Maenads into a grove of trees. "}

She first became famous because she was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and was involved in Black Power movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then she has become known for her work as a writer and speaker while teaching at the University of California. She has done research in the areas of feminism and critical theory and is a prison abolitionist.\nDavis grew up in Alabama, then went to college at Brandeis University and University of California, San Diego. She was involved in activism from her youth. After becoming a Doctor of Philosophy in Germany, she returned to the US and began teaching as a professor. In 1969, she was fired from teaching for being a member of the Communist Party. A judge decided it was an illegal firing and the school eventually hired her back.\nIn 1970 she was put in prison by FBI agents. Some black revolutionaries tried to break their allies out of prison by kidnapping a white judge and some jurors in Marin County, but the police didn't let them get away and the revolutionaries and judge were shot to death. The FBI suspected that she bought the gun one of the revolutionaries used and decided to accuse her of the murder of the judge. In 1971 she appeared at the Marin County Superior Court and said, \"I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California.\" She was released from jail in 1972. Ronald Reagan said that she should never be allowed to teach at a California university. The English rock band The Rolling Stones recorded a song called \"Sweet Black Angel\" that was on their 1972 album \"Exile on Main St.\" and dedicated to Davis.\nIn the 1990s, she left the Communist Party and began to focus her activism on prisons. She gave a speech in 1997 called \"The Prison Industrial Complex\". In it she said \"prisons are becoming an integral part of the US economy.\" She said that fear of young people of color was being exploited to create a fast-growing industry, the prison-industrial complex (PIC). She created a prison abolitionist group called Critical Resistance in the same year. She wants there to be no prisons or police because she believes that the US prison system is more like a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system.\nSince she started focusing on prisons, she has also supported Democrats like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden in presidential elections.\nDavis is Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\nShe was married to Hilton Braithwaite in the 1980s."}

The galaxy is named after Arthur Allen Hoag who discovered it in 1950. He identified it as either a planetary nebula or an unusual galaxy. The object has about eight billion stars, and is ~600 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens.\nCharacteristics.\nA nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy. The inner core of the galaxy is about (), while the surrounding ring has an inner 28\u2033 diameter of () and an outer 45\u2033 diameter of (), which is slightly larger than the Milky Way Galaxy. The gap separating the two stellar populations may contain some star clusters that are almost too faint to see.\nAs rare as this type of galaxy is, another more distant,reddish (and unnamed) ring galaxy can be seen through Hoag's object, between the nucleus and the outer ring of the galaxy, at roughly the one o'clock position in the picture to the right.\nHistory and formation.\nArt Hoag suggested the visible ring was a product of gravitational lensing. This idea was later discarded: the nucleus and the ring have the same redshift, and the ring shows knotty structure which would not be visible with gravitational lensing.\nMany of the details of the galaxy remain a mystery, especially how it formed. \"Classic\" ring galaxies are usually formed by the collision of a small galaxy with a larger disk-shaped galaxy. This collision produces a density wave in the disk which leads to a characteristic ring-like appearance. Such an event, 2\u20133 billion years in the past, may have formed polar-ring galaxies. However, there is no sign of any second galaxy which would have acted as the \"bullet\", and the core of Hoag's object has a very low velocity relative to the ring, making the typical formation hypothesis unlikely.\nNoah Brosch suggested that Hoag's object might be a product of an extreme \"bar instability\" which occurred a few billion years ago in a barred spiral galaxy. Schweizer \"et al\" claims that this is unlikely because the nucleus of the object is spheroidal, whereas the nucleus of a barred spiral galaxy is disc-shaped. However, evidence is somewhat thin for this dispute to be settled. A few other galaxies share the characteristics of Hoag's object, including the bright detached ring of stars, but their centers are elongated or barred, and they may exhibit some spiral structure While none match Hoag's object in symmetry, this handful of galaxies are known to some as Hoag-type galaxies."}

Some Jews believe that God has given them a special job to repair the world and make it a better place. According to this view, they must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to God, and as God\u2019s partner in repairing the world \u2013 to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals, to make more peace and respect between people, and to protect the earth\u2019s environment from destruction. This process is known as \u201c\"tikkun olam\"\u201d (from Hebrew) \u2013 repairing the world. \nFrom the Bible.\nThis origin of the idea in the Torah (the first five books of the Tanakh, which are also included in the Christian Bible). Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature:\nAccording to Judaism, God made an agreement called a \u201ccovenant\u201d with Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish people. The Bible says that God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshipped God and were faithful to him. God made this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac, and with Isaac's son, Jacob. God also gave Jacob another name \u2013 Israel. This is how Jacob\u2019s descendants got the name the \u201cChildren of Israel\u201d or \u201cIsraelites.\u201d The Jewish religion, God later gave the Israelites the Torah to the Israelites through their leader, Moses. The Torah told the Israelites how to live and build their community. God gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws in the Torah.\nInterpretations.\nReligious Jewish views.\nThe Jews are sometimes called the \u201cChosen People\" because the Bible says God told them \u201cyou will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\u201d (Exodus 19:6) and \u201cFor you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord chose you to be His own special nation out of all peoples on the earth\u201d (Deuteronomy 14:2). Religious Jews (\"orthodox\") understand this means that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God - for example, that they must build a just society and serve only God. They believe that this covenant works in two ways: if they follow God\u2019s laws, He will give them his love and protection, but they are also responsible for their sins \u2013 bad actions \u2013 and not doing what God told them. Religious Jews believe that they must teach other people that God exists and that God wants all people to do good actions. Jews believe that their job in the world is to be \"a light to the nations\" (Isiah 49:6) by showing the people of the world ways to make the world a better place.\nModern views.\nThe idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Another opinion is that even though the Jews chose to follow God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the \"Jewish soul\" was already chosen. However, Jews do not believe that being a member of the Chosen People gives them any special talents or makes them better than anyone else, and many of whose who are considered \"Jewish\" (especially secular/(non-religious ones) do not believe they are \"Chosen\" in any way at all. \nJews generally do not try to convince other people to believe in Judaism. Jews believe they have a special job to show all peoples that God exists, but people do not have to be Jewish to follow God. All people can serve God by following the Seven Commandments (rules) given to Noah. But, Judaism accepts people who choose to change their religion to Judaism. \nFrom other religions.\nThe Jewish people have a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran:\nO children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).\nMany Christians also believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (), but because of Jewish rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status (). This doctrine is known as Supersessionism."}

This is best explained with examples:\nForms.\nIn the sentence \"\"He\" sees the woman\", \"he\" is the subject of the sentence. In the sentence \"The woman sees \"him\"\", \"him\" is the object. \nEnglish.\nSo, in English we use different forms of the pronoun: he/him. \"Him\" would be the accusative case. If we use a noun, there is no difference in English. We use the same word \"man\": The man sees the woman\" and \"The woman sees the man. \nIn many languages different forms of the word are used, depending on what function it has in the sentence - subject or object. \nLatin.\nFor example, in Latin. \"The man sees the woman\" = \"Vir feminam videt\", while \"The woman sees the man\" = \"Femina virum videt\". For \"man\", Latin uses \"vir\" for the subject, and \"virum\" for the object. Also, in the same sentences, we have \"femina\" for a subject and \"feminam\" for object. The form used for the direct object (\"him\", \"virum\", \"feminam\") is known as the \"accusative case\", while the form used for the subject (\"he\", \"vir\", \"femina\") is known as the nominative case.\nGerman.\nIn some languages, like German, the accusative case is applied to the definite article and not to the noun. In German, \"the car\" as the subject of a sentence may be \"der Wagen\". This is the form in the nominative case. When \"the car\" is used as the object in a sentence, it becomes \"den Wagen\", the accusative."}

It is part of the Border Region as it is on the border with Northern Ireland. It is part of the province of Ulster. It is named after the town of Cavan. 73,183 people live in the county according to the 2011 census. Not many people live in the north-western area of the county as there are many mountains.\nCavan borders six other counties: Leitrim to the west, Fermanagh and Monaghan to the north, Meath to the south-east, Longford to the south-west and Westmeath to the south.\nGeography.\nThe county has a lot of countryside with many lakes and small hills called drumlins. The highest point of the county is in the Breifne mountains, mount Cuilcagh at .\nCavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and it is said it has 365 lakes, one for every day of the year. At , Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake in the south of the county. A large area of lakes in the north and west of Cavan are marked as Specially Protected Areas (SPA), example of this being Lough Oughter. Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest), D\u00fan na R\u00ed Forest Park and the Burren Forest.\nMany rivers in Ireland start in County Cavan. The Shannon Pot is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at . The River Erne is a major river which starts from Beaghy Lough south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for to Lough Erne.\nHistory.\nIn medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of East Br\u00e9ifne after its ruling Gaelic family. This in was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of Br\u00e9ifne. For this reason the county is also sometimes known as the Breffni County. The natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs made a good defence against invaders.\nHistorically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 when Br\u00e9ifne was shired and became the county of Cavan. In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century.\nParts of Cavan were under Norman influence from the twelfth century. The remains of several buildings from the time can still be seen at Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. There are also some remains of early abbeys in the county, like at Drumlane and Trinity Island.\nThe Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county like Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. Wars aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. Much of Cavan's land is clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the dominant farming system in the county. The total farmed area is in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan.\nPeat cutting exists in the northwest of the county, in the Cuilcagh range.\nCavan has expanded in other industries, mainly quarrying, energy production and manufacturing facilities."}

Fisher first published in 1930 by Oxford University Press which combines Mendelian genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. It is one of the most important books of the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nEditions.\nA second, slightly revised edition was published in 1958. In 1999, a third variorum edition, with the original 1930 text, annotated with the 1958 alterations, notes and alterations accidentally omitted from the second edition was published.\nIts significance.\nWhen Fisher started his career, genetics was not a well-understood science. There were biologists who did not see how evolution by natural selection could happen with heredity as they understood it. The main effect of the book was to show the small changes in genes could indeed lead to the large changes seen in the fossil record. Fisher's second chapter, the \"Fundamental theory of natural selection\", convinced most biologists that Darwin's idea and modern genetics were compatible (could work together). Fisher's view was reinforced by Julian Huxley, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewell Wright, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and G. Ledyard Stebbins. All of these men were in touch with genetics. With the addition of two field biologists, Ernst Mayr and Bernhard Rensch and a palaeontologist, George Simpson, the group put together the modern synthesis.\nFisher also developed ideas on sexual selection, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. He showed that mutations with big effects usually reduce the fitness of the individual. He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a greater chance of survival. He set the foundations for population genetics.\nAbout a third of the book concerned the applications of genetics to humans. Using the British census data of 1911, he showed there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class. This was partly due, he believed, to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children. Therefore he suggested subsidies (he called them allowances) to families with larger numbers of children, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He himself had two sons and six daughters.\nReviews.\nThe book was reviewed, among others, by physicist Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin's. After his review, C.G. Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin. The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years.\nAlthough Fisher's book was immediately understood by the few who understood genetics, it was a long time before the general biologist appreciated it. It is now agreed to be one of the foundations of modern population genetics and evolution.\nFisher's book also had a major influence on W.D. Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection. Hamilton, a leading theoretician of the later 20th century, said:"}

It is a natural limit to the normal luminosity of stars. The state of balance is a hydrostatic equilibrium. When a star exceeds the Eddington limit, it loses mass with a very intense radiation-driven stellar wind from its outer layers.\nEddington's models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure. Eddington showed that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere.\nMost massive stars have luminosities far below the Eddington luminosity, so their winds are mostly driven by the less intense line absorption. The Eddington limit explains the observed luminosity of accreting black holes such as quasars.\nSuper-Eddington luminosities.\nEddington limit explains the very high mass loss rates seen in the outbursts of \u03b7 Carinae in 1840\u20131860. The regular stellar winds can only stand for a mass loss rate of about 10\u22124\u201310\u22123 solar masses per year. Mass loss rates of up to 0.5 solar masses per year are needed to understand the \u03b7 Carinae outbursts. This can be done with the help of the super-Eddington broad spectrum radiation driven winds.\nGamma-ray bursts, novae and supernovae are examples of systems exceeding their Eddington luminosity by a large factor for very short times, resulting in short and highly intensive mass loss rates. Some X-ray binaries and active galaxies are able to maintain luminosities close to the Eddington limit for very long times. For accretion powered sources such as accreting neutron stars or cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs), the limit may act to reduce or cut off the accretion flow. Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes is one possible model for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).\nFor accreting black holes, all the energy released by accretion does not have to appear as outgoing luminosity, since energy can be lost through the event horizon, down the hole. Effectively, such sources may not conserve energy."}

He volunteered to fight in the Pequot War (1634-1638), but saw no action because Plymouth's volunteers were not needed.\nIn 1642, Thomas Granger, Brewster's 16-year old servant, was caught committing bestiality upon Brewster's livestock. He admitted his transgression, and was executed with the animals, as the Bible commanded in Leviticus 20:15.\nLater life and death.\nBrewster and his family moved to Duxbury, Plymouth Colony, north of the settlement at Plymouth. He served in the militia under Myles Standish. Brewster died at Duxbury between 6 October 1650 (when his will was written) and 31 January 1651 (when the will was probated)."}

The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. It is also part of the immune system. Clear fluid called \"lymph\" flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as \"lymphocytes\".\nIn lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way. A lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nThe usual way to know that a person has non-Hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy (testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue)."}

Since 2011, winners of the College Championship and the Teachers Tournament also play in the Tournament of Champions.\n\"Jeopardy!\"'s Tournament of Champions takes two weeks. The first five games are the quarterfinals, with three new contestants each day. The winners of the five games move on to the semi-finals. The four players with the highest scores who did not win their quarterfinal game also move on as \"wild card\" players.

Passing scorers were invited back for an interview and mock game using an electronic buzzer system. Their photographs are taken for their files, and they are asked to fill out a short information sheet with interesting facts about themselves that may be later used by Alex Trebek during the interview portion of the show. Selected contestants and alternates were notified that they had been chosen to appear on the show one to two months later. They are then flown to Los Angeles to tape the show. Taping occurs over a period of two days, with the five quarterfinals played on the first day and the three semifinals and two final games played on the second day. Accommodations were provided for the contestants at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, with taping taking place at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.\n2000s.\nContestants registered on the \"Jeopardy!\" web site rather than submitting postcards.

Accommodations for contestants are provided at the Hilton in Universal City, California.\n2006\u2013present.\nAll web site registrants take a 50-question timed online test at one set test time, usually late February. The test is given using Adobe Flash and takers are given 15\u00a0seconds per clue to type in their responses. A random selection of those who pass the test are invited to attend regional auditions in November at 4 locations around the United States at which another 50-question written test is given, followed by interviews and mock games. The number of students selected for the regional auditions is usually around 300, from which 15 are selected for the show.\nList of participants.\nThe following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament.

The category was Literary Characters and the answer was \"Although he doesn't actually appear in \"1984\", his presence is everywhere\u2014on posters, coins &amp; telescreens\". The correct response, given by Evan was \"Who is Big Brother?\" (Evan advanced to the semifinals, but Gabriela did not have enough money to make it via wildcard). Jeff Xie and Alan Koolik were tied for first place at the end of the 2014 Teen Tournament. The tie was broken in a special tiebreaker round.

Contestants in this tournament are full-time undergraduate college students with no prior degrees and traditionally wear a sweater bearing the name of their college or university during their appearances. The existence of this tournament does not disqualify college students from auditioning for the regular shows, but tournament participants cannot later compete in regular play. The tournament began during the 1988-89 season (Season 5) and has been played every season (except for seasons 31, 35, and 37), always during any one of the three traditional sweeps ratings periods (November, February, or May) with the exception of being held in April 2018 due to Alex Trebek's brain surgery and April 2020 due to The Greatest of All Time Tournament.

Three College Champions have made the Tournament of Champions finals (Tom Cubbage in 1989, Jeff Stewart in 1994, and Cliff Galiher in 2007), but only Cubbage won the event.\nMany college champions have been invited to later Jeopardy! \"all-time best\" tournaments as well, with varying degrees of success:\nList of participants.\nThe following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Finalists who earned more than the minimum guarantee are as indicated. \n Milo Dochow was a losing contestant in the Winter 1999 Teen Tournament but was invited to participate in the following year's College Championship after being potentially disadvantaged by a questionable judges' ruling in Final Jeopardy!.\n The first quarterfinal match of the 1992 College Championship ended in a tie, between Chris Montplasir and Ken Kansa. Chris won the tie-breaker to earn a spot in the semifinals and Ken earned enough money to earn a wildcard spot (although two other tie-breaker clues were given and correct responses were given for neither, resulting in editing out of the broadcast). The first semifinal match of the 1997 College Championship also ended in a tie, between Steven Beiver and Brian Chan. Steven gave the correct response to the tie-breaker clue to earn a spot in the finals.\n Kevin ended up with $0 going into the Day Two Final Jeopardy!, and ineligible to play. He was kept to have his first day score tabulated for purposes of the final score in the two day total dollars format.\n Kate Laubscher, Hannah Norem, and Michael Sieja were tied at $14,400 in the quarterfinals at the end of Final Jeopardy. Hannah led going into Final Jeopardy, while Kate and Michael tied. Kate led going into Double Jeopardy, eliminating Michael for the last spot in the semifinals.\nStanford University is the only college to have two winners.\nThe only College Champions from Ivy League schools are Terry O'Shea of Princeton University in 2014 and Dhruv Gaur of Brown University in 2018."}

It competed with the Minidisc and the Digital Audio Tape (DAT), but neither format could replace the compact cassette. It was marketed as a cheaper alternative to DAT. \nEquipment for the digital compact cassette was able to playback analog compact cassettes as well; recording could only be done to DCC, though. A DCC tape is similar in appearance to a regular cassette, except that it has reel access holes on only one side, and has a shutter covering both the tape and reel access holes, similar to the shutter on a floppy disk. \nUnlike DAT, DCC uses lossy data compression. This means that the copy of the data is not identical to the original. Audio data could be compressed to about 25 percent of its original size. \nThe main problem of the format was tied to handling: Finding a song in the middle of a 90 minute tape takes several minutes, with Minidisc it is instantaneous. Minidisc allows to delete or move tracks, features which the digital compact cassette cannot offer. \nEven though some of the features were addressed (like rewinding a 90 minute tape in less than a minute), the format never gained much market share. The compression format used by DCC is based on MP1, which was a predecessor of MP3. The CD-R, which is compatible with standard CD players, eventually replaced both DCC and MiniDisc for home audio recording. The CD-R also replaced analog tape."}

It was a letter sent to Pope John XXII, dated 6 April 1320. The declaration confirmed Scotland's status as a independent, sovereign state and defended Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked. The letter was signed at Arbroath by eight earls and thirty-one barons.\nBackground.\nWhen King Alexander III of Scotland died in 1086, his heir was his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway. King Edward I of England negotiated to have his son, Edward II of England become her husband and share the crown of Scotland in 1289. But Margaret died on her way from Norway to Scotland in 1290. This began a period in Scotland called the First Interregnum (1290\u20131292). Scotland was without a monarch. Edward I stepped in to choose who would be king from among the candidates who had any claim to be king. He chose John of Scotland. But Edward treated the Scottish king badly. When King John tried to break free, Edward put him in prison, then allowed him to live in France. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland with his army to take everything for himself. Scotland remained without a king until 1306 when Robert the Bruce declared himself king of Scotland defying Edward I. Just before doing this Robert the Bruce had been involved in a dispute with John Comyn. The two met before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306 and a fight broke out. John Comyn was killed and Robert the Bruce was crowned king three weeks later at Scone. Accused of murdering Comyn Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope. During the wars that followed the Scots won a major battle at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In 1317 the pope called for a two year truce which Scotland ignored. For failing to listen to him he excommunicated all of Scotland.\nOverview.\nThe Declaration was part of a larger plan to show the Pope and others that Scotland was an independent kingdom and had a right to rule itself. The English king Edward I had written to the pope before confirming his right to rule Scotland. For his part the pope refused to accept Robert the Bruce as the king of Scotland. \nDated April 1320 the Declaration of Arbroath was a letter to Pope John XXII at Avignon from fifty leading men of Scotland. There were 39 names, (eight Scottish earls and thirty one barons), who signed the document with their seals. On strips on the bottom of the letter are seals and names of eleven more who signed. Bernard Linton, Chancellor of Scotland and Abbot of Arbroath is believed to be the author. It was written at the monastery of Arbroath in Scotland. \nThe letter began by reminding the pope of Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Saint Andrew. That under the protection of the church Scotland had lived in peace until King Edward I of England pretended to be their friend. He then invaded their country while it was without a king. The letter then told of the hardships they faced under English rule. Showing their resolution the letter stated:\nImmediate effect.\nThe pope was impressed by the declaration and with the promise by the Scottish barons to support the pope's crusade. He encouraged Edward II to make peace with the Scots. The pope sent two delegates. The French king also wanted to see peace between England and Scotland and he sent two delegates. Peace talks went on until 1321 without the English recognizing Scottish independence. \nThe English convinced the pope it was the fault of the Scottish that there was no progress. The pope issued six rulings against the Scots stating all invaders of England would be excommunicated and re-issued the excommunication against Robert the Bruce.\nFinally in October 1328 a peace treaty was agreed to between Scotland and England. Edward III gave up all claims on Scotland. The interdict on Scotland and the excommunication of its king were finally removed. The second part of the treaty agreed that the son of Robert the Bruce, David II of Scotland and the sister of Edward III of England would marry. The wedding took place on 12 July of 1338 when David II, then four years old married Joan of the Tower, aged six, at the church at Berwick, Scotland.\nIn 1998 The United States Congress resolved that the US Declaration of Independence has been modeled on the Declaration of Arbroath. It was further resolved that April 6th was from that day on officially National Tartan Day in commemoration of that famous document."}

It is the only member of the genus \"Catreus\".\nThe species was named as \"Phasianus wallichi\" by the English zoologist Thomas Hardwicke in 1827; he named it after the Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich. Later the name was changed to the present name by the English ornithologist John Gould.\nDescription.\nThe Cheer pheasant lacks the color and brilliance of most pheasants. The male has a brownish yellow plumage with black markings and a long gray crest; the skin of the face is red. Its long tail is mainly gray and brown, and has 18 feathers, something that puts this pheasant apart from similar species.\nThe female is smaller than the male, somewhat duller in plumage and more heavily marked, with reduced red facial skin, a shorter crest and lacking the male\u2019s .\nDistribution.\nThe Cheer pheasant is endemic to the western Himalayas; it is distributed in the highlands and scrublands (a place where small shrubs are abundant as well as small herbaceous plants, without trees) of the southern foothills, most frequently from of the western Himalayas, from north Pakistan, through Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, India, to east to central Nepal.\nSurveys in 1981 and 2003 in the Dhorpatan area of western Nepal found that there were 70 places where the birds were heard, suggesting that many birds exist in this area (approximately 200 birds). In another survey in 2010, Cheer pheasant was detected in 21 calling sites in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.\nBiology and social behaviour.\nThese pheasants tend to be fairly (traveling in groups) for much of the year, with groups of five to fifteen birds, but form monogamous pairs during the breeding season from late April to June. They breed on steep cliffs during summer and the number of eggs in a nest is relatively large; there are usually ten to eleven eggs in each nest, though in some cases there as many as 14.\nThe Cheer pheasants get most of their food from the ground, digging with is powerful beaks; they eat roots, tubers, bulbs, seeds, insects and other small animals. They look for food mainly during the morning and evening, walking in pairs or, sometimes, in family groups.\nIn studies made in upper Beas Valley, it was found that the Cheer pheasants were sensitive to the presence of humans.\nConservation.\nDue to ongoing habitat loss, small population size and hunting in some areas, the Cheer pheasant is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. The Cheer pheasant is legally protected in Nepal and India, and occurs in at least 12 protected areas in Himachal Pradesh, three in Uttar Pradesh and three in Nepal.\nAttempts to reintroduce captive bred Cheer pheasants in Pakistan have been unsuccessful."}

The premises is now a building called Carlton House.\nTo many who are now part of the city's expansive curry house business, Mahomed was a pioneer.\nAlthough forced to declare bankruptcy in 1812, he created a concept that was to become something of a phenomenon 100 years later, said Vivek Singh, chef at the Cinnamon Club, a Westminster restaurant serving New Indian cuisine.\nMr Mahomed's plan had been to serve \"Indianised\" British food which would appeal to the Indian aristocracy in London as well as British people who had returned from India, he said.\n\"The Indian aristocracy however would not come out to eat in the restaurant because they had chefs at home cooking more authentic food - it was just not a big enough draw to come out.\"\nA few years later he opened special treatment baths on the seafront at East Cliff, Brighton.\nHe died in 1851 and was buried in St Nicholas' churchyard in Brighton"}

Starch (formed by a lot of glucose molecules) is the most commonly stored food in the tubers, although other carbohydrates, such as inuline (formed by many fructose molecules), are stored in the tubers of certain kinds of plants, like the Jerusalem artichoke (\"Helianthus tuberosus\").\nThe purpose of tubers are saving food and reproduction. Under natural conditions, the parts of the stem that connect the tubers with the main stem die in the autumn or winter. The tubers are left in the ground and are able to produce shoots from their buds the following spring.\nPotatoes are also artificially reproduced by tuber pieces, called \"seed pieces\". A tuber is cut into pieces, each with one or more \"eyes\" (an \"eye\" of potato is a group of buds covered by very small leaves). These pieces are planted and each produces a new plant from one of its \"eyes\".\nTuberous roots.\nA tuberous root or storage root, is a modified lateral root, made bigger to function as a storage organ; sometimes these roots are called \"tubers\" but they are roots, not modified stems like the true tubers.

This shark has white tips on its fins. With an average length of 2-2.5 metres, the silvertip shark rarely reaches the length of 3 meters.\nDescription.\nThe silvertip shark is slender with a long and broadly rounded snout. The eyes are large and round. An interdorsal ridge is present on this species. The first dorsal fin is large with a pointed apex. It originates over or slightly in front of the free tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin originates over or just behind the origin of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large and semifalcate with narrowly rounded or pointed tips. The caudal fin is asymmetrical in shape with a rather large upper lobe. \nThe top of the body is dark grey or grey-brown with a bronzy sheen, and the underside is white. A white band, which is not clearly visible, is on its flank. \nThe silvertip shark may be confused with the grey reef shark (\"Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos\"), but the grey reef shark has dark tips on the pectoral fins and trailing edge of the caudal fin. Also, the whitetip reef shark (\"Triaenodon obesus\") is similar in appearance to the silvertip shark. Although both shark species have white markings on the dorsal and caudal fins, the whitetip reef shark doesn't have these markings on the tips of the pectoral fins. The whitetip reef shark also has a more square-shaped snout.\nThe silvertip shark has 12-14 teeth on each jaw. The upper teeth are broad and strongly jagged. \nHabitat.\nSilvertip sharks are found over continental and island shelves and offshore banks. They prefer offshore islands, coral reefs and banks to depths of 800 m. They are common in tropical oceans. \nThey have been found in the western Indian Ocean: the Red Sea and of East Africa, including Madagascar, Seychelles, Aldabra Group, Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific they are found off southern Japan to northern Australia and French Polynesia. In the eastern central Pacific they are found off southern Baja California, Mexico to Colombia, including the Cocos, Gal\u00e1pagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. \nBehaviour.\nThis shark is a great hunter and is very stealthy. They are usually found in shallow waters, making them one of the most commonly seen sharks. Its unpredictable behaviour and aggressive hunting tactics make it a higher threat to humans than most other sharks.\nFeeding.\nPrey of the silvertip shark include benthic and midwater fish such as wahoo, eagle rays, wrasses, and tunas as well as small sharks. This shark also feeds on octopuses and squid. The silvertip shark has been observed swimming along the edge of a group of other species of feeding sharks, taking food from them.\nReproduction.\nThe silvertip shark is viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Courtship is a little different in these sharks and they are known to hold each other. Bites are normal, so much so that a female Silvertip shark has been found without a part of the dorsal fin after mating. Mating occurs in the summer. During the gestation period that could extend to a year, the embryos feed from the yolk and once the yolk is exhausted, the yolk-sac modifies itself into a placental connection through which the newborns feed from the mother.\nThe newborns are born in litters (normally 5 to 6 but can be from 1 to 11) and are anywhere between 63 to 81 centimeters or 25 to 32 inches long. The females are considered sexually mature once they grow to be about 2 meters long and in the case of males, it is 1.8 meters. The pups are known to swim with the mother shark in shallow waters before becoming independent.\nHuman interaction.\nSilvertip sharks are somewhat dangerous. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), there have been four unprovoked attacks by this species on humans, with no deaths. Arguably, humans are much more dangerous to the shark. Silvertips are caught by commercial and artisan fisheries across their range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. Their fins are highly valued for shark-fin soup and are sold on the export market, along with their skin and cartilage.\nThis species is vulnerable to overfishing (like almost all sharks) due to its slow reproductive rate. The IUCN has listed the silvertip shark as near threatened, and has noted that it may be approaching the criteria for vulnerable.\nThe silvertip shark is caught by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines. In the Philippines, it is in the top ten most caught species by number (0.73%), and weight (2.6%), with individuals ranging in size from 2.1-2.4 metres, and averaging 23 kg in weight. "}

It has an open entry policy. This means that students' previous academic achievements are not taken into account for entry to most undergraduate courses. Most OU undergraduate students are based in the United Kingdom and study off-campus. Many of its courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate) can be studied off-campus anywhere in the world.\nThere are a number of full-time postgraduate research students based on the 48 hectare university campus where they use the OU facilities for research, as well as more than 1000 members of academic and research staff and over 2500 administrative, operational and support staff.\nThe OU was established in 1969 and the first students enrolled in January 1971. The University administration is based at Walton Hall, Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, but has regional centres in each of its thirteen regions around the United Kingdom. It also has offices and regional examination centres in most other European countries. The University awards undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as non-degree qualifications such as diplomas and certificates, or continuing education units.\nWith more than 250,000 students enrolled, including around 32,000 aged under 25 and more than 50,000 overseas students, it is the largest academic institution in the United Kingdom (and one of the largest in Europe) by student number. It is one of the world's largest universities. Since it was founded, more than 1.5 million students have studied its courses.\nThe OU was rated top university in England and Wales for student satisfaction in 2005, 2006, second in 2007, and top in 2012. These were United Kingdom government national student satisfaction surveys. Out of 132 universities and colleges, the OU was ranked 43rd (second quartile) in the \"Times Higher Education\" Table of Excellence in 2008. It was rated highly in Design, Art History, English, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Computer Science, Development Studies, Social Policy and Social Work, and Sociology. It was ranked overall as a nationally top forty, and globally top five hundred university by the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" in 2011, as well as being ranked 247 for citations of its academics.\nThe Open University is also one of only three United Kingdom higher education institutions to gain accreditation in the United States of America by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an institutional accrediting agency, recognized by the United States Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.\nDrastic drop in enrollments.\nThe Open University enrollments for undergraduate courses have dropped from a peak in 2009/10 of 209,705 to the latest published figure of 121,395 in 2016/17. According to The Guardian, this was caused mainly by the government. In 2012 it allowed fees for part-time degrees to rise to \u00a36,750 per year, whilst severely limiting maintenance grants for students. Part-time courses at traditional universities in the U.K. have also suffered a drop in enrollment."}

Walter was one of the Scottish leaders at the Battle of Bannockburn. Just before the battle began Walter along with his cousin James Douglas, Lord of Douglas were knighted by King Robert the Brucealong with many others.

She was the wife of Charles S. Stratton (aka General Tom Thumb), the star attraction of P. T. Barnum's American Museum in New York City.\nEarly years.\nWarren was born in Middleborough, Massachusetts to James Bump and his wife. She stopped growing at age 10. In adulthood, Warren stood 32 inches tall, weighed 30 pounds, and was perfectly formed in every way.\nShe had seven siblings. Her sister \"Minnie\" was even smaller than she. Lavinia claimed descent from William the Conqueror and five Mayflower Pilgrims.\nIn her middle teens, Warren briefly taught school in Middleborough, then began appearing as an exhibit in a relative's \"floating palace of curiosities\" on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.\nP. T. Barnum and the American Museum.\nAmerican showman P. T. Barnum heard of Warren in 1862. He invited her and her parents to visit him in his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. They did so, and Barnum found Warren, \"a most refined and intelligent young lady, well educated, and an accomplished, beautiful and perfectly developed woman in miniature.\"\nHe hired her for his American Museum in New York City. She lived quietly in the home of one of his daughters in New York while he made arrangements for her debut. He assembled \"a very splendid wardrobe\" for Warren and provided her with \"costly jewelry\". She made her debut and created a sensation with the public.\nUnfortunately, she was exhibited with Commodore Nutt, another little person several years her junior. He fell in love with her. She however did not reciprocate his feelings, and considered him nothing more than a \"nice little boy\". \nBarnum gave Warren a ring, which did not fit properly, so he told her that she might give the ring to Nutt while he provided her with another. She gave the ring to Nutt, and he regarded it as a love token. Warren was in great distress. She did not want to offend Nutt by repelling his attentions, but she did not want to encourage him either.\nGeneral Tom Thumb.\nBarnum offered her $1,000 a week to exhibit herself at his Museum. She accepted and was an instant hit. The press adored her. She rivaled Stratton in popularity, and earned $3,000 a day for the Museum.\nMarriage.\nWarren met Stratton in 1861. They were married in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City, on February 10, 1863. Two thousand people attended their wedding, including the most celebrated persons of the day. \nTheir \"round the world\" honeymoon included meetings with the Lincolns in Washington, D.C., and Queen Victoria in London. Barnum manufactured a hoax of the couple becoming parents (fueled with photographs), but Warren was, in fact, unable to bear children.\nLater years and death.\nThe couple travelled widely. They returned to Barnum's employ in 1881. Thumb died in 1884, leaving his wife penniless and depressed. On April 6, 1885, Lavinia married Count Primo Magri, an Italian miniature person who had come to America seeking his fortune. \nThe couple toured, then exhibited themselves at Lilliputia (aka Midget City) on Coney Island. She met United States President William Howard Taft in 1911. She once boasted that she had met Lincoln and every president after him. Lavinia died in Middleborough in 1919."}

He was a four year old child when P. T. Barnum introduced him to show biz. The boy (who was passed off as a young adult) created a sensation at Barnum's American Museum in New York City. He toured Europe, appeared before royals, and returned to America rich. Thumb married Lavinia Warren in 1863, and continued to tour. Show biz took its toll on his health however. He died of a stroke in 1883. \nEarly life.\nGeneral Tom Thumb was born Charles Sherwood Stratton in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Sherwood Edward Stratton, a carpenter, and Cynthia (Thompson) Stratton, an inn worker. He stopped growing at 18 months. He was 25 inches tall and weighed 16 pounds in 1842 when P. T. Barnum persuaded his parents to exhibit him at $3 a week. The boy was four years old when he left home for Barnum's American Museum in New York City.\nBarnum.\nBarnum molded the boy into an entertainer, and provided the child with an expensive and exquisitely tailored wardrobe. He was presented as General Tom Thumb and his age bumped up to eleven years in order to fool the public into thinking he was an adult. \nHe debuted on December 8, 1842. At first, he was shy about appearing in public, but he took to the stage and began imitating famous little people like Napoleon and Cupid. The General was a hit. Thirty thousand people attended his first week performances.\nBarnum and Thumb toured Europe in 1844 with an appearance before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Buckingham Palace. Other European royals also f\u00eated him. In America, Thumb remained the principal attraction at the American Museum for many years.\nMarriage.\nIn 1847, Thumb returned to America very rich. Thumb bought a mansion in Bridgeport, and toured alone for a time. He teamed up with Barnum at times when the showman's bank account was running low. \nIn 1862, Thumb met Lavinia Warren, another of Barnum's oddities, and the miniature couple were married on February 10, 1863, in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City. The wedding was attended by 2,000 guests, many of them the A-list celebrities of the day.\nLater life and death.\nThe couple toured for many years, and made a large fortune. In 1881, Thumb and his wife were caught in a hotel fire that almost took their lives. They joined the Barnum &amp; London Circus. Show biz took its toll on Thumb however. His health declined. On July 15, 1883, Thumb died following a stroke, age 45. He is buried in Bridgeport, Connecticut. More than 10,000 people attended his funeral."}

{"id": "405563", "revid": "7744672", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=405563", "title": "Jumbo", "text": "Jumbo (about Christmas 1860 \u2013 September 15, 1885) was the first international animal superstar. He was the first African bush elephant to reach modern Europe alive. He was born in eastern Africa, and captured there by Arabian hunters in early 1862. He was sold first to a traveling zoo in Germany, then to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. He was traded to the London Zoological Gardens for a rhinoceros. \nJumbo lived in the London Zoo about 16 years. He was the biggest elephant in captivity. American circus showman P. T. Barnum simply had to have this huge elephant in his circus. He bought Jumbo in 1882. The elephant made his debut in the United States on Easter Sunday 1882 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He toured with Barnum's circus for three years. In September 1885, he was killed in a railroad accident in Canada. \nJumbo attracted as much attention after his death as he did in life. His hide was stuffed and his bones preserved. His hide and skeleton were displayed first with Barnum's circus and then with museums. His hide was destroyed in a fire at Tufts University in 1975. His skeleton was displayed for many years in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. As time passed, children forgot about him. His skeleton was put away.\nJumbo's sale in 1882 created public anger in Britain. It drew the attention of people around the world. \"Jumbomania\", a fad for all things Jumbo, was born. The civilized world was flooded with Jumbo neckties, jewelry, and other souvenirs. People around the world were sad when he died. Jumbo's greatest legacy is his name. In the English language, it is now a word that means \"very large\".\nEarly life.\nIt is impossible to know exactly where or when Jumbo was born. In February 1862, a British explorer met Jumbo in the desert camp of Arabian elephant hunters. This camp was on the border of eastern Sudan and Abyssinia (now, Eritrea). The hunters had been hired to capture wild animals for export to European zoos. \nThe explorer estimated that Jumbo was tall and weighed about . Based on his height and weight, Jumbo was about one year old. He was probably born at Christmas 1860. \nJumbo had a long, hot journey ahead of him. He walked several hundred miles with other wild animals to the Red Sea. At the port of Suakin, the little elephant was put aboard a steamship. In time, he arrived in Trieste, Italy. From Italy, he was taken by train to Dresden, Germany. He was then sold to a traveling zoo.\nJardin des Plantes.\nIn late 1862, Jumbo was sold to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Jumbo was probably brought to his new home in either late 1862 or early 1863. The French were disappointed with him; they thought he would be larger. Jumbo lived in the Rotunda for Large Herbivores with two Asian elephants, several camels and giraffes, and a hippopotamus.\nIn October 1863, two more baby African elephants and several camels were brought to the Rotunda. The little elephants were called Castor and Pollux. They played together and slept together. Children loved the new elephants. The two animals came to be called \"the pets of young Paris\". Jumbo did not want attention from people; he stayed in his stable. Five elephants now lived in the Rotunda of the Jardin.\nIn April 1865, the government found that the living conditions in the Jardin were very bad. Officials thought some of the elephants should be sent to zoos in other countries. The officials of the London Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park wanted an African elephant. They traded an Indian rhinoceros and a few other animals for Jumbo. He was brought to the London Zoo in June 1865. Jumbo was lucky. Castor and Pollux were killed during a war with Prussia in 1871. They were eaten by the French.\nLondon Zoological Gardens.\nJumbo was very ill when he arrived at the London Zoo. He had not been fed properly. His hide was covered with filth that had to be scraped and scrubbed off. The nails on his feet were overgrown, and the soles of his feet were covered with sores. \nAbraham Bartlett, the Superintendent of the London Zoological Gardens, put the little elephant into the care of animal keeper Matthew \"Scotty\" Scott. Scotty had a talent for understanding and managing animals. Jumbo grew stronger and healthier under Scotty's care.\nThe little elephant was named Jumbo. There is no record of the origin of this name. He may have been named after Mumbo Jumbo, a west African tribal holy man. This is not certain though. Bartlett may have named the elephant Jumbo because he liked the sound of the word. He had once named a gorilla Mumbo. There is a very slim possibility that Jumbo may have been named in Paris.\nJumbo became a great attraction in the London Zoo. Queen Victoria and members of the Royal Family adored him. Children rode in the saddle (\"howdah\") on his back for a penny. The young Winston Churchill (and probably Queen Victoria's children Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice) rode in Jumbo's \"howdah\".\nBy the time Jumbo was seven years old, he had a huge appetite. Every day he ate of hay, a barrel of potatoes, two bushels of oats, fifteen loaves of bread, and lots of onions. He also drank several pails of water. If Scotty thought Jumbo needed some medicine, the elephant was given a gallon or two of whiskey.\nIn 1880, Jumbo hit his iron cage doors with his tusks and broke both off near the jawbone. He was in pain. He stopped eating. He leaned against the walls for support. Bartlett and Scotty were forced to perform some crude surgery with a harpoon-like tool they had made. Bartlett was disappointed with the damage to Jumbo's tusks. He had been hoping that Jumbo would grow to be a \"tusker\" an elephant with huge tusks. After the surgery, Jumbo kept his tusks worn away by rubbing them against the walls of the Elephant House. They never grew more than a few inches long. \nIn 1882, Jumbo was tall at the shoulder. He weighed more than . His trunk was long. It could reach high into the trees. In the magazine \"Harper's Weekly\", Jumbo was said to be \"as gentle with children as the best-trained poodle dog.\" The magazine said he gently took biscuits and lumps of sugar from zoo visitors.\nJumbo is sold.\nWhen Jumbo was brought to the zoo in 1865, Bartlett had wanted to raise the elephant himself. He needed a keeper who would obey him. He chose Scotty because he was rather inexperienced. Bartlett would be disappointed. Scotty had his own opinion on how to raise Jumbo. The close relationship that grew between the keeper and the elephant was something Bartlett hated.\nIn 1882, Jumbo was the biggest elephant living in captivity. Bartlett thought it best to find a new home for Jumbo for two reasons. First, he thought Jumbo was about to enter \"musth\". This is a difficult time in a male elephant's life. Certain glands in the elephant's head become inflamed causing the animal to behave violently. The other reason Bartlett wanted to move Jumbo was the elephant's close relationship with Scotty. Bartlett thought Jumbo might go on a dangerous rampage if Scotty should die.\nJumbo had tantrums. He would try to damage the Elephant House at night. He may have been frightened and angry because Scotty went home every night. He was only calm during the day when Scotty was nearby or when he carried children around the zoo in his \"howdah\". Jumbo's behavior only made Bartlett more sure that he must find another home for the elephant. Years after Jumbo's death, zoologists studied casts of the elephant's teeth. They discovered that his molars were erupting abnormally and probably causing him pain. This was likely the reason for Jumbo's tantrums.\nBartlett and members of the London Zoological Society were happy when P. T. Barnum, a circus showman from the United States offered to buy Jumbo for $10,000. Barnum had once owned two museums in New York City. They had burned to the ground. He was now part-owner of the Barnum, Bailey, &amp; Hutchinson Circus. Barnum knew the huge elephant would make him a fortune if he appeared with the circus. \nBarnum's partner Hutchinson did not want to buy Jumbo. \"What difference does it make if an elephant is seven feet high or eleven or twelve feet high? An elephant is an elephant!\" he said. But Barnum wanted Jumbo more than he wanted any other elephant in the world because Jumbo was the \"biggest\" elephant in the world. Bartlett and the London Zoological Society took only two days to decide that Jumbo would be sold to Barnum. \nWhen the British learned that their beloved Jumbo was going to be sold, they were outraged. Bartlett received many angry letters. Children begged Bartlett to keep Jumbo in London. Art critic John Ruskin wrote that the English were not \"in the habit of selling their pets.\" An effort was made to stop the sale by going to court, but Barnum won. The British courts said he was the legal owner of Jumbo.\nA large wheeled box was built to hold Jumbo during his journey to America. It was made of heavy pine boards bolted to a strong oak base, and made even stronger with iron straps. It measured long, wide, and high. It was large enough for Jumbo to stand in it, but it was not large enough for him to lie down or turn around. Although the ends of the box were open, they were made strong with iron bars. Jumbo could look out the open end and swing his trunk. \nPlans were made to move Jumbo on February 18. Jumbo would not get into the box. A second attempt was made on February 19 with the same result. Jumbo laid down in the street. Crowds of people cheered for Jumbo. He stayed in the street for a week. Bill Newman, Barnum's agent in London, sent the showman a telegram. \"Jumbo won't get up\", it read. Barnum sent a telegram back reading, \"Let him stay there as long as he wants. It's great publicity.\"\nBartlett thought Scotty was controlling Jumbo with a secret signal to keep him from getting into the box. He told Scotty \nhe would be fired if Jumbo did not get into the box. The next day, Scotty got Jumbo to enter the box. Barnum hired Scotty to take care of Jumbo even though he had many elephant keepers in the United States.\nJumbomania.\nPeople around the world were interested in the sale of Jumbo. Souvenirs such as Jumbo neckties, fans, and hats were sold in England and America. Jumbo's picture was printed on thousands of advertisements. Some of these advertisements showed Jumbo in strange places like the opera house and a saloon in the Wild West. \nPotholders, cigars, and a large sewing machine were all named after Jumbo. Soap, thread, and baking powder were sold using Jumbo's name. One advertisement from this time shows Jumbo in leather boots running across a desert. Another picture shows Jumbo feeding a baby elephant a laxative called Castoria.\nThousands of letters were sent to London Zoo officials. The writers of these letters wanted Jumbo to live at peace in England. A \"Jumbo Retention Fund\" was set up to keep Jumbo in the London Zoo. One lady sent her new sewing machine to the fund. A bride sent Jumbo a piece of her wedding cake. Thousands of children wrote to Barnum begging him to leave Jumbo in his London home. Barnum refused.\nJumbo leaves England.\nJumbo lived sixteen years and nine months in the London Zoo. He was now about to start a new life in another land. His trip to America started on the cold morning of March 22, 1882. Jumbo was put into a harness early in the morning. He was led to the box. He did not want to get into it, but he did. It took two hours to chain the fighting elephant inside the box. \nSix horses pulled the box from the yard at the Elephant House. It sank into the soft soil of a path. It took three hours to pull the box from the path. It sank into soft soil two more times on its way to the zoo gates. Four more horses were harnessed to the box. It passed through the main gate about 1:30 a.m. The five-mile trip to the London docks started.\nThe most level way to the Thames was chosen because the horses could not pull the box up any hills. Crowds were watching. Scotty rode on the front of the box. He comforted Jumbo and stroked his trunk. Jumbo was quiet through most of the journey. The box started down a steep hill near the old Clerkenwell House of Detention at the top of Farrington Road. Jumbo shook his head in alarm. The box was forced to move very slowly. \nAt St Katharine's Dock, east of the Tower of London, the box was lifted with a winch at 7 a.m. on March 23. It was put on the barge, \"Clarence\". Workers made the box secure. Jumbo was given a big breakfast. An old lady who had walked behind the box all the way from Regent's Park brought Jumbo some beer. She said good-bye through her tears. \nThree hours later, the tide was favorable. The barge was towed into the river by tugboats bearing the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes. Thousands of people had gathered in every empty space to say good-bye to Jumbo. The barge floated downstream to the Isle of Dogs. \nJumbo took alarm again when the barge passed Dundee Docks. He rammed the bars of his crate. The bars were loosened. The engines were cut. Scotty comforted the frightened elephant. The trip was resumed. At the Millwall Docks, the box was lifted by crane about 3:45 p.m. to the quayside. It was here that Jumbo would spend the night. \nThe box was weighed as it was lifted. It weighed twelve and a half tons. It was known that the wood and iron of the box weighed six and a half tons. Jumbo therefore weighed six tons. Scotty and Bartlett had always thought Jumbo weighed six tons. But this was the first time Jumbo had actually been weighed mechanically. On Friday March 24, it took only eight minutes to lower Jumbo and his box to the \"Assyrian Monarch\".\nThere were 600 passengers on the \"Assyrian Monarch\". They were mostly Russian Jews going to the United States. There were 90 crew members. Food was brought on the ship for Jumbo's 13\u201314 day voyage. There were 65 bales of hay, of ship's biscuits, 50 loaves of white bread, three sacks of oats, three sacks of bran, and two sacks of onions. \nA lunch party was held on the ship for London Zoo officials, the Sheriff of London, businessmen, Barnum's agents, and others interested in the adventure. Barnum's agent Bill Newman was given the Zoological Society's Gold Medal for calmly and skillfully handling Jumbo. Scotty the man who had given Jumbo devoted care and love for 18 years was ignored. The ship left the next morning. Lady Angela Burdett-Coutts was Jumbo's great friend. She came from London to Gravesend with friends to feed the elephant his last English buns. When the visitors left, the ship put out to sea.\nScotty took off most of Jumbo's chains to make him comfortable. His head, body, and trunk were free. His feet were chained. The elephant leaned against the side of the box. He fell asleep for the first time in several days. Jumbo's box got plenty of fresh air. Passengers fed him bread and fruit. Barnum had news stories about Jumbo put in rubber bags then dropped into the sea. Weeks later, the first bag washed ashore in southern Ireland. A telegram was sent to London after passing the last point of British soil called the Lizard. It read, \"Jumbo well; very quiet; unchained.\"\nJumbo arrives in America.\nThe \"Assyrian Monarch\" arrived in the New York harbor about midnight on Easter Sunday April 9, 1882 after almost two weeks on the sea. A telegram was sent to the \"London Times\" telling the British that Jumbo had arrived safely in America and was in good health. Jumbo's crate was lifted from the hold of the \"Assyrian Monarch\" to a small steamer called \"Only Son\". Jumbo was ferried across the Hudson River to the New York docks.\nBarnum and his partners Bailey and Hutchinson went aboard the \"Only Son\" with several journalists to see Jumbo. The elephant had traveled well. He drank a bottle of whiskey. Barnum did not drink alcoholic beverages and protested. He looked at Scotty and said, \"I do believe that elephant's growth has been stunted by the use of beer.\" \nSome journalists were disappointed with Jumbo's height. They said he was just as big as the other elephants in Barnum's circus. Barnum told them there was a big difference between an elephant's actual height and his \"museum\" height. The journalists were satisfied with this explanation (whatever it meant). Barnum was thrilled with Jumbo. Everyone was talking about the animal, and this meant ticket sales.\nSuperintendent Hatfield of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children came aboard the \"Only Son\". He had heard reports of Jumbo's bad temper, and boarded the ship to be certain Jumbo was not a threat to the children of New York City. Barnum told him Jumbo was \"perfectly lamb-like\". Hatfield took a long look at Jumbo, then left the ship with the sense that Jumbo was indeed a gentle animal. \nA crowd of hundreds had gathered on shore to welcome Jumbo. By late afternoon, the crowd had grown to 10,000 impatient, noisy onlookers. Jumbo became frightened. His crate swayed as it was lifted and lowered to a waiting barge. Three cheers were raised. By 7:00 pm, Jumbo was ashore. His crate had been put on a strong wagon.\nThe crowd wanted Jumbo to walk up Broadway to Madison Square Garden where the circus was playing. Bailey would not allow it, fearing the animal might attack the crowd. Eight horses and 500 men could not move the wagon. Another eight horses were brought in as well as Gypsy and Chief, two Asian elephants from the circus. The eight additional horses were not needed. They were led behind the wagon as it started to move. The elephants were used as needed to push the wagon out of ruts.\nWhen the procession arrived at Madison Square Garden, Jumbo's crate was too tall for the building's entrance. He was left on the sidewalk for the night, his crate covered with tarpaulins. In the morning, blacksmiths removed the iron bars of the crate. Jumbo was free, but he would not leave the crate. Scotty stood aside to let Jumbo take his time. The elephant finally stepped out, and went into the building. Floorboards shattered under his weight. When he reached the race track, he knelt and rolled over. Scotty assured everyone Jumbo was not dead but only resting after his long trip. He finally rose and was taken to his stall, after another rest period. Once in his stall, a heavy chain fastened to a stake was wrapped around his leg. He yanked the stake from the ground and tossed it aside. Meanwhile, the largest crowd in circus history was waiting for the afternoon performance to start.\nJumbo in America.\nBarnum bought Jumbo for $10,000. Jumbo's entire costs actually amounted to $30,000. Barnum later wrote that Jumbo earned his costs in his first two weeks with the circus at Madison Square Garden. Jumbo did no tricks, but 20,000 customers per day saw him in the circus zoo and the parade at the start of the show. The London Zoo had sent Jumbo's \"howdah\" to America. The great elephant gave rides to circus customers.\nOn a trip to England in late May 1882, Barnum met a crowd of children on the street who were still angry that the elephant had been taken away. Barnum made plans the same month to raise an iron building on the Thames Embankment for his circus shows. People in the neighborhood did not like the idea. They said they would go to court to stop the plan. Barnum dropped the idea.\nBarnum had another publicity plan. The Brooklyn Bridge was finished in 1883. This was a long-awaited and exciting event. Barnum offered the bridge company $5,000 to allow Jumbo to cross the bridge before the official opening. The company directors believed Barnum was using the bridge for circus publicity. They said \"no\" to his offer.\nJumbo travelled in luxury when he went on tour every year. He had his own railway boxcar. Barnum called it \"Jumbo's Palace Car\". It was a red and gold boxcar with huge double doors at the center for Jumbo to be able to go in and out easily. Scotty slept in a bunk in a little room near Jumbo's head. Jumbo would never let Scotty close the door to the little room. He loved his friend and wanted to be near him always. \nScotty and Jumbo always shared a bottle of beer before going to bed for the night. It was a little ritual Jumbo loved. One night Scotty drank the bottle of beer and fell asleep. Jumbo picked him up very carefully and set him down near the empty bottle. Scotty woke up and found the bottle. He \"got the message\". He never forgot to share a bottle of beer with Jumbo again. \nIn his four seasons as the top star of Barnum's circus, Jumbo never hurt anyone. Now and then though, he tested his strength by destroying parts of his winter Elephant House. Jumbo earned $1.5 million in his first year with the circus. It is likely 16 million adults and 4 million children saw him at the circus.\nIn his last years with the circus, Jumbo's health grew poor. He could not eat his food because his teeth were worn out. There was no treatment. Jumbo would sooner or later die of this trouble with his teeth. Barnum made plans to have Jumbo preserved after his death by a taxidermist. He arranged everything while Jumbo was still alive just in case the elephant died suddenly.\nJumbo's death.\nJumbo was 24 when he was killed on September 15, 1885, in the rail yards at St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada. It was about 9:30 pm. The circus had just finished a performance. The elephants were being led along the main track in the rail yards to their boxcars. To their left was a steep bank; to their right was the circus train. An unscheduled freight train roared down upon them from the east. The engineer tried to stop the train, but failed. \nAnimal keepers got most of the elephants to safety down the bank. Jumbo and a dwarf elephant called Tom Thumb were the last act on the programme and the last to leave the Big Top. Tom Thumb was behind Jumbo. the little elephant was hit by the train and thrown into a ditch. His left leg was broken, but he lived. Jumbo ran down the track away from the oncoming train with Scotty beside him. The locomotive struck Jumbo from behind. He roared in pain as the train carried him down the track. He was wedged partly above and partly below a flatcar. \nJumbo's skull was fractured in several places. He had serious injuries inside his body. Blood poured from his mouth and trunk. Jumbo reached for and held Scotty's hand in his trunk. He died within minutes of the accident. The locomotive and the tender were thrown off the track. They were destroyed in the collision.\nNeither Barnum or Bailey was on the scene of the accident. Hutchinson directed the clean up. One hundred men were needed to remove Jumbo's body from the tracks. Policemen were sent to the scene to drive away souvenir hunters. Scotty became hysterical when he discovered half of Jumbo's ear had been cut off by a collector.\nTaxidermists from Rochester, New York, eventually arrived to take charge of the body. Jumbo's death was a serious loss for the circus. So much so that Barnum took the first steps in bankruptcy proceedings a few days after the tragedy.\nJust before Jumbo's trip to America in 1882, Barnum had insured the elephant for $500,000. The policy expired once Jumbo stepped on American soil. The elephant was not insured at the time of his death. He had been brought into the United States as \"breeding stock\". No insurance company would cover livestock for accidents. Jumbo left no children in spite of the fact that he had an elephant \"wife\" in the London Zoo named Alice. He had completely ignored her during the 18 years he had called London home. Alice was given black and a widow's cap to wear after the death of her \"husband\".\nBarnum sues the railway.\nBarnum sued the Canadian Grand Trunk Railway for $100,000. The case was heard in April 1887. The company claimed it was not liable for Jumbo's death. They said the circus workers were responsible for the death of the elephant. The circus workers had cut down part of a fence so they could lead the elephants across the track. If they had used the regular crossing further down the track, the company stated, railway workers would have warned them of the approaching train. The accident could have been avoided. \nThe railway also claimed Jumbo was worthless. The London Zoo had sold him, the railway stated, because he was a dangerous animal. They also pointed out that they were not liable for losses above $15,000 as stated in their contract with the circus. The circus argued the contract was illegal, and presented statements from Scotty and other professional animal people who had worked with Jumbo. These statements said Jumbo was not dangerous. \nBarnum finally withdrew the lawsuit. He needed the good will of the Grand Trunk Railway if he wanted to move his circus around Canada. He settled out of court for $5,000. He was also granted the right to use the Grand Trunk rails for free in the coming year. This was worth $5,000 in itself. Barnum left court with $10,000.\nConspiracy theories.\nTwo weeks after Jumbo's death, a news reporter named C. F. Richtel of the Hartford, Connecticut, \"Sunday Globe\" suggested Barnum had killed the elephant \"for advertising purposes\". Richtel was an old enemy of Barnum's, and accused the showman of masterminding Jumbo's death because the elephant had tuberculosis. Barnum sued the newspaper for $50,000. He settled out of court. The editor of the \"Globe\" learned the truth about Jumbo's death when he interviewed Scotty and others who had been present at the elephant's end. The editor fired Richtel and published a meek apology to Barnum. \nA theory put forth in 1960 alleged that Jumbo's flatulence had created a nasty problem for Barnum and the circus, so the showman decided to get rid of the elephant. Under cover of darkness and amid the clamor of the rail yard, Barnum was said to have had an animal keeper fire a single shot from a powerful pistol into Jumbo's eye. The elephant staggered some distance, trampled the dwarf elephant, collapsed, and died beneath a railway car. No projectiles were found during examinations of Jumbo after his death or later examinations of his skull. The theory has been proven false. \nAftermath.\nBarnum tried to get as much publicity as possible from Jumbo's death. He called a publisher three days after the accident. He wanted a children's book printed at Christmas about the event. He also told news reporters a lie about Jumbo saving both the dwarf elephant and Scotty, then turning to face the train alone and head-on.\nJumbo's remains were sent far and wide across America. His tusks were broken into many pieces in the accident. These pieces were sold as souvenirs. Cornell University bought Jumbo's heart. The great elephant's bones toured America for a few years with the circus. They weighed . Then they were sent to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. His skeleton was put on display now and then. As time passed though, children forgot him. The skeleton was put away. It was never displayed after 1977. \nJumbo's hide was stuffed in Rochester, New York. Barnum told the taxidermists that he wanted Jumbo to look like a mountain. They pulled the hide as much as possible without tearing it. After all the hard work, Jumbo stood a foot taller in death than he had in life. The stuffed hide toured with the circus for a few years. It was then sent to the Barnum Museum of Natural History at Tufts University. It weighed . At Tufts, Jumbo became the school mascot. His picture was put on school-related items like hats and flags. \nOn April 14, 1975, Jumbo's hide and many other museum pieces which could never be replaced were destroyed in a fire at Tufts. Some of what was believed to be Jumbo's ashes was put in a Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar. The jar was kept in the university's athletic department. School athletes rubbed it for good luck before games. \nOn the 100th anniversary of Jumbo's death in 1985, a monument by Winston Bronnum was built to the great elephant in St. Thomas. It stands on a bluff above the city. Not far away is a bright red caboose. It is a souvenir stand. There is also a museum at the site that displays a model of a small circus.\nLegacy.\nJumbo's legacy was the joy he gave millions of people just by being himself. His name however may be his greatest legacy. Before the big elephant, the word 'Jumbo' was not known in the English language. The word has entered the language to mean anything that is huge. People will always remember Jumbo because of this word.\nJumbo's enormous size caused scientists to think he was a separate species of elephant. He was the largest elephant ever known. He was named the type specimen for this new species. At a later time, it was learned that Jumbo was not a separate species, but a variant of a known species. He became then a subspecies. \nAfter Jumbo's death, it was important that he be dissected by scientists. It was important that his skeleton be carefully kept for future scientists to study. The dissection was started in St. Thomas, and completed in Rochester, New York. Jumbo's stomach was cut open. Coins, keys, rivets, screws, and a policeman's whistle fell out. \nJust before the stuffed Jumbo and his skeleton were put on display, Barnum asked newspaper people and high-society ladies to come to a fancy hotel for a party. He made speeches, then served his guests a gelatin dish made from Jumbo's ground tusks."}

{"id": "405656", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=405656", "title": "Commodore Nutt", "text": " \nCommodore Nutt (April 1, 1848 \u2013 May 25, 1881) was an American entertainer. He was born George Washington Morrison Nutt in New Hampshire. He was very short. In 1861, he was touring New England with a circus when P. T. Barnum hired him to appear at the American Museum in New York City. Barnum gave Nutt the stage name Commodore Nutt, a wardrobe that included naval uniforms, and a miniature carriage in the shape of an English walnut. Nutt became one of the Museum's major attractions.\nNutt was in love with Lavinia Warren, another little person like him, at the American Museum. Lavinia was several years older than Nutt. She thought of him only as a \"nice little boy\". This in some ways, made Nutt depressed later on in life. She married General Tom Thumb in a spectacular wedding masterminded by Barnum in 1863. Nutt went to the wedding as Thumb's best man. He stayed away from women for a long time after the wedding. In 1879, he married Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California.\nNutt toured the world between 1869 and 1872 with the Thumbs and Lavinia's sister, Minnie Warren. They returned to America rich after performing before royalty. Nutt left Barnum's employ after a disagreement with the showman. He toured with a comic opera company, put together a variety show on the United States West Coast, and operated saloons in Oregon and California. He returned to New York City, and died there of Bright's disease in May 25, 1881.\nBirth and family.\nGeorge Washington Morrison Nutt was born in Manchester, New Hampshire to Major Rodnia Nutt (1810\u20131875), and his wife Maria (Dodge) Nutt (1807\u20131859) of Goffstown, New Hampshire. Rodnia Nutt was a rich farmer, a Manchester city marshal, and a Manchester city councilman.\nThe Nutts had five children. The first, whose name and sex are not known, was born on 8 December 1837. James Dodge was born on 28 January 1838, and Rodnia, Jr. on 11 October 1840. A daughter, Mary Ann, was born on 22 September 1844. According to Nutt family records, George Washington Morrison was born on 1 April 1848.\nNutt and his wife were \"large, hearty folk\". Mr. Nutt weighed over . Their sons Rod, Jr. and George Washington Morrison were little people. In 1861, Rod, Jr. was about tall, and George was about . George weighed about .\nAncestry.\nGeorge's ancestors include William Nutt (1698\u20131751), a weaver of English ancestry. William left Londonderry, Ulster, Northern Ireland for North America in the early 18th century. He started a family in colonial New England. A part of Manchester was called Nutfield in the early days of settlement. A pond and a road near the pond were named for early Nutt settlers.\nP. T. Barnum and the American Museum.\nNutt's career as an entertainer may have started in 1854. He may have been a performer with a small circus in Manchester. The circus manager, William C. Walker, once wrote that he had discovered Nutt. He also wrote that he was the first to show him.\nNutt was being exhibited and touring the New England countryside with a manager named Lillie when P. T. Barnum learned of him. Lillie was charging as little as a nickel to see the boy whose education had been neglected. Barnum was disgusted. Lillie knew nothing about exhibiting the boy \"in the proper style\", as Barnum put it.\nBarnum met Nutt in 1861 when the boy went to the American Museum in New York City. In his autobiography, Barnum wrote that Nutt was \"a most remarkable dwarf, who was a sharp, intelligent little fellow, with a deal of drollery and wit. He had a splendid head, was perfectly formed, and was very attractive, and, in short, for a 'showman' was a perfect treasure.\"\nBarnum knew Nutt could be a major museum attraction. He hired a lawyer to lure Nutt away from his manager. Following Barnum's orders, the lawyer offered Nutt's parents a large sum of money to sign their son to a five-year contract. He promised them that the boy would be taught to be \"a genteel, accomplished attractive little man\".\nA contract was signed on 12 December 1861. Barnum hired the 13-year-old, 29-inch George and his 21-year-old, 49-inch brother, Rodnia, Jr. The contract required Barnum to give both young men food, clothing, a place to live, and the costs of travel and medical care. Barnum promised to take care of the moral and academic education of the brothers.\nSalaries would start at US$12 per week with increases every year. The two brothers would each get $30 per week in the fifth and last year of their contract. They would also get 10% from the sales of their souvenir books and photographs, with at least $240 the first year and $440 the last year. At the end of the fifth year, they would receive a carriage and a pair of ponies from Barnum.\nPublicity campaign.\nOnce the contract was signed, Barnum started a publicity campaign to prepare the public for Nutt's debut. He let reporters think he was \"trying\" to hire the little person. When other showmen heard this rumor, they rushed in to offer Nutt's parents huge sums of money to be the first to sign their son.\nBarnum was pleased. The publicity created much excitement. In a letter he leaked to reporters, he wrote that he was forced to outbid the competition. The showman claimed to have paid $30,000 to hire the little person. The boy then became known as \"The $30,000 Nutt\".\nBarnum gave the little person the stage name, Commodore Nutt. In addition, he provided Nutt with a wardrobe that included miniature naval uniforms. For the Commodore's jaunts about town, the showman had a little carriage built for him. This carriage looked like an English walnut. The top of the vehicle was hinged. When the top was lifted, the little Commodore could be seen sitting inside.\nNutt's carriage was pulled by Shetland ponies. It was driven around New York by Rodnia, Jr. dressed in the uniform of a coachman. Barnum thought these little trips about town the best form of advertisement. Nutt's carriage is now in the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\nDebut.\nCommodore Nutt made his debut at Barnum's American Museum in February 1862. He was a great success. Some museum-goers believed they were being \"humbugged\" by Barnum though. They thought that Nutt was really General Tom Thumb in disguise.\nNutt did look like the Tom Thumb of the past, but Thumb had aged and put on weight over the yearsa fact museum-goers either forgot or ignored. Nutt was a scamp; he took pleasure in the public's confusion, and encouraged the error.\nWhen Nutt debuted, Thumb was touring the American South and West. Barnum wanted to silence those with doubts at the Museum. He asked Thumb to cut his tour short, return to New York, and perform on the same stage with Nutt. Thumb returned to New York.\nThe little men were billed as \"The Two Dromios\" and \"The Two Smallest Men, and Greatest Curiosities Living.\" The exhibit opened on 11 August 1862. Despite what their eyes witnessed, some museum-goers still said that Nutt was Tom Thumb in disguise. Barnum wrote, \"It is very amusing to see how people will sometimes deceive themselves by being too incredulous.\"\nAbout two months after his debut, Nutt met with New York City Police Department officers. He applied for and was given a policeman's job. He ordered a uniform. Then he sent a telegram to the officers of the Ninth Precinct telling them that he had just gotten a job on the Broadway Squadwith \"extraordinary powers to arrest\" people outside the Museum and to \"take [them] upstairs\".\nPresident Lincoln.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln asked Barnum and Nutt to come to the White House in November 1862. When the two arrived, Lincoln left a cabinet meeting to welcome them. Nutt asked Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he was the man who was spending so much of Uncle Sam's money. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, interrupted to say that he was the man. \"Well,\" said Nutt, \"It is in a good cause, anyhow, and I guess it will come out all right.\" As Barnum and Nutt were on their way out, President Lincoln shook Nutt's hand. He told the Commodore that he should \"wade ashore\" if his \"fleet\" was ever in danger. Nutt looked up and down Lincoln's long legs. \"I guess, Mr. President\", he said, \"You could do that better than I could.\"\nRelationships.\nLavinia Warren.\nMercy Lavinia Warren Bump was a little person who taught school in her hometown of Marlboro, Massachusetts. She was traveling on a showboat-museum in the Midwest however when Barnum learned of her. He hired her in 1862. Her name was shortened to Lavinia Warren. She first appeared at the Museum in 1863. Warren was 21 years old, tall, and weighed . Barnum billed her as \"The Queen of Beauty\". Nutt developed an \"adolescent crush\" on her, but Nutt would be disappointed.\nBarnum gave Lavinia a diamond and emerald ring. It did not fit her finger properly, so he told her to give the ring to Nutt as a token of her friendship. Nutt regarded the ring as a token of her love instead. He fell more in love with her than ever. Lavinia was uncomfortable with his attentions. She thought of herself as \"quite a woman\", but regarded Nutt as just a \"nice little boy\".\nThumb was not appearing in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but he met her when he visited the Museum in the autumn of 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he had fallen in love with her. Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the little man was rich.\nThumb's rival.\nNutt knew that Thumb was in love with Lavinia. He was jealous. He had a fight with Thumb in a dressing room at the Museum. He threw him on the floor, and beat him up. Nutt invited himself along when Lavinia was asked to Barnum's home for a weekend visit. Little did he know that Thumb and his mother would be there, too.\nNutt left New York City on a train late Saturday night. He got to Barnum's house about 11 pm. He found Thumb and Lavinia alone in the downstairs parlor. Thumb had proposed, and Lavinia had accepted. Nutt only learned of their engagement a week later when Lavinia and Barnum told him. Nutt had a hard time forgiving both Thumb and Barnum for (as he termed it) this \"dastardly\" offense. \nPreparations.\nLavinia's younger sister Minnie was much smaller than she was. Barnum thought she would make a good match for Nutt. He asked Nutt to think about marrying Minnie. Nutt told Barnum he had little faith in women. He said that he would not marry \"the best woman living\".\nBarnum wanted Minnie and Nutt to go to the wedding as Lavinia and Thumb's bridesmaid and best man. Nutt refused. Later, Thumb himself asked Nutt to be his best man. Nutt accepted. He told Barnum, \"It was not your business to ask me. When the proper person invited me, I consented.\"\nBarnum's \"Fairy Wedding\".\nThumb and Lavinia were married at Grace Episcopal Church, New York City, on Tuesday 10 February 1863. Nutt and Minnie were best man and bridesmaid at the \"Fairy Wedding\". Police stopped traffic as people gathered in the streets to see the arrival of the wedding party. The wedding was planned to start at noon, but it did not start until the bride got to the church at 12:30 pm. Barnum led the wedding party down the center aisle.\nTwo thousand people were invited to the wedding. Mrs. John Jacob Aster, Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt, Mrs. Horace Greeley, and General Ambrose Burnside were there. Members of the church complained about the \"marriage of mountebanks\". They became angry when they were told they could not sit in their own pews. Much of the public curiosity about the marriage was based on an interest in the sexual mechanics of Thumb and Lavinia. Barnum did not encourage or discourage this interest.\nThe wedding reception was held in the Metropolitan Hotel on Broadway at 3 pm. The four little members of the wedding party stood on top of a grand piano so they could be seen by everyone. Nutt gave Lavinia a diamond ring as a wedding present. Americans loved the wedding. It was welcome relief from the horrors and sorrows of the war.\nWorld tour and aftermath.\nPeople around the world took great interest in the wedding. Barnum thought this was a chance to make a lot of money. He sent the members of the wedding party on long, successful tours of America and Europe. The four little persons were sent off again this time on a grand tour of the world as The Tom Thumb Company.\nThe four little ones left the United States on 21 June 1869. They travelled 60,000 miles around the world, visited 587 cities and towns, and gave 1,471 performances of songs, speeches, and military drills. They returned to America in 1872. Nutt and Barnum argued after the tour. Nutt quit. He joined Harry Deakin's Lilliputian Comic Opera Company. This company toured America in an operetta called \"Jack, the Giant Killer\".\nNutt and his brother Rodnia put together a variety show. It played in Portland, Oregon. It was not a success. Nutt went to San Francisco, California, and put together another show. He tired of the life within a year and quit. Another show he put together about this time was not successful either. Nutt ran a couple of saloons in Oregon and San Francisco, but these were not successes.\nLast years.\nNewspapers reported at least four times that Nutt and Minnie were married. They were close friends, but never husband and wife. Minnie married a song and dance man who performed on roller skates named Edward Newell. She died while having his baby in 1878.\nOne day long after the wedding of the Thumbs, Barnum asked Nutt why he had not married. \"Sir, my fruit is plucked\", he said, \"I have concluded not to marry until I'm thirty.\" His bride's height was of no concern, he said, but he did \"prefer marrying a good, green country girl to anyone else.\"\nIn 1879, Nutt married Miss Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California. He had met her while he was touring the American West. She was a bit shorter than most women, but not a little person.\nAfter his failures on the West Coast, Nutt went back to New York City. He bought a saloon. One day, he was caught selling liquor without a license. The New York City courts closed his saloon. Nutt was in charge of an amusement area called Rockaway Pier for a time. He returned to performing with an act called \"Tally-Ho\".\nDeath.\nEarly in 1881, Nutt had an attack of Bright's disease (nephritis). He was sick for more than two months. He died on 25 May 1881 at the Anthony House in New York City. Nutt's wife cried over his coffin at the funeral. She called him her \"dear little boy\", and said that he was \"so good\". Nutt was buried in Merrill Cemetery at Manchester, New Hampshire.\nNutt had grown from his original , and weighed a little less than at his death. In 1891, the editors of \"Appleton's Cyclopedia\" wrote, \"Commodore Nutt was distinguished for large-hearted virtues that are often lacking in bigger men; his genial temper was allied to constancy and generosity that entitle his memory to the highest respect.\" The editors noted that Nutt was \"for many years faithful to an early love.\""}

The rising of mobile phones is often blamed for the rise of helicopter parent-style teaching over the years. The phone enables the mother to keep in touch at all times, which was almost impossible before. What caused most notice was parents following up children as far as college and early employment. Sports coaches, college teachers and employers have had the experience of parents turning up to complain and argue in support of their children."}

The name \"Clostridium\" comes from the Greek word \"kloster\"\u00a0(\u03ba\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1), which means \"spindle.\"\n\"Clostridium\" bacteria are gram-positive and can produce endospores.\nImportant species.\nThere are many different species of \"Clostridium\" bacteria. Some of these species can cause serious illness.\n\"Clostridium botulinum\".\n\"Clostridium botulinum\" bacteria make a toxin called botulinum. When botulinum toxins get into food or wounds, they cause botulism, a dangerous disease. Botulism can paralyze the muscles (stop the muscles from moving or working). People can die from botulism if their breathing muscles get paralyzed. This makes them unable to breathe.\nMost cases of botulism happen because people eat meat that was not cooked well enough, or eat canned food that was not canned properly.\nIf babies under age one eat natural honey, they can get infant botulism. Most adults and older children can eat natural honey without getting sick. In healthy people, the intestines are filled with good, healthy bacteria. Usually, these regular bacteria keep \"Clostridium botulinum\" under control. Infants do not have enough of these good bacteria to be able to eat honey safely.\nSometimes doctors use botulinum toxins to treat medical problems. There are medicines, like Botox, which contain botulinum toxin. Some people get Botox treatments when they have wrinkles in the face. When it is injected into the forehead, Botox paralyzes the muscles in the face, and makes the face look smoother.\n\"Clostridium difficile\".\n\"Clostridium difficile\" bacteria can cause bad diarrhea and serious illness. Usually, people get \"Clostridium difficile\" infection after they have taken antibiotic medicines. These medicines can kill the healthy bacteria that normally live in the intestines and keep \"Clostridium difficile\" bacteria under control. \"Clostridium difficile\" infection can be spread from person to person, and is getting more common in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities. Just in the United States, 14,000 people die every year from \"Clostridium difficile\" infection.\n\"Clostridium difficile\" is an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This means that many antibiotic medicines cannot kill the bacteria. This makes \"Clostridium difficile\" infection difficult to treat.\n\"Clostridium tetani\".\n\"Clostridium tetani\" causes tetanus. Usually, people get tetanus when they get a cut or wound, and \"Clostridium tetani\" bacteria get into the wound. At first, tetanus causes the muscles in the jaw to spasm (tighten). (Tetanus is often called \"lockjaw\" because the\u00a0jaw\u00a0muscles spasm so badly that the jaw seems \"locked.\") This can make it difficult to swallow. As tetanus gets worse, other muscles in the body get stiff and spasm.\nTetanus immunization can keep people from getting tetanus."}

This is in contrast to gram-negative bacteria, which cannot hold the \"crystal violet\" stain. Instead they take up the counterstain (\"safranin\" or \"fuchsine\") and appear red or pink. \nThe difference is caused by the cell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms have thick peptidoglycan layer. This protects them, so they do not need rigid cell walls. On the other hand, gram-negative bacteria have thin, insignificant peptidoglycan layers, so they do need rigid cell walls for support and protection. "}

'Abd us-Samad remembered that four to five of his listeners from the Communist Party were in tears on hearing the recitation, although they didn't understand what was being recited, but they cried, apparently touched by his recitation. \nIndira Gandhi, an Indian prime minister and political leader always felt touched by his recitation and would stop alongside to appreciate his recitation.\n'Abd us-Samad died on 30 November 1988, and is survived by his three sons (from oldest to the youngest): Yasir, Hisham, and Tariq.
