{"id": "745702", "revid": "7756978", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745702", "title": "Thai script", "text": "The Thai script is the writing system used to write the Thai language. It is an abugida and brahmic script, which means that vowel markings must be attached to a consonant letter. The consonants are always written in order from left to right, but vowels have rules where it must be written to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first consonant in each syllable.\nAn example of this will use the Thai consonant \u0e01 to show where the following vowel must be written.\nSpaces are not used to set words apart, but sentences and clauses. Punctuation markers are not normally used. For example, the sentence \"I like to eat fried rice, but she likes to eat pad thai\" would be written in Thai as \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22. If one were to place spaces in between each word (which Thai does not do), it would be written as \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48 \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d \u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14 \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22.\nHistory.\nThe writing system was based on the Old Khmer Script, but it made changes because the Old Khmer Script did not show tones, which was an important part of the Thai language. To make the writing system suitable for the Thai language, the Thai script added new letters and tone markers that would show the tone of a word. It was the first known writing system in the world to show the tones of a word. Even though the Chinese writing system existed before the Thai script was invented and that Chinese was a tonal language at that time, there was no writing system that could show the tones of Chinese words until much later. The first time Chinese would be written using the Latin alphabet and tone markers was the Portuguese-Chinese dictionary written by Matteo Ricci and Lazzaro Cattanero written around the 16th century.\nLetters.\nThai has 44 consonant letters, 32 vowel markers and combinations, and 4 tone markers. This makes the total amount of letters in Thai 80, one of the largest out of any sound-based writing system used for a living language. Despite having so many consonant letters, the number of consonant sounds is actually far fewer, with 21 consonant sounds. For example, the \"th\" digraph used in RTGS, which would be the aspirated alveolar stop (written as [t\u02b0] in IPA), can be written in six different ways: \u0e10,\u0e11,\u0e12,\u0e16,\u0e17, or \u0e18. This is because the letters used in the word will decide what tone a word has and whether or not the words are loanwords. \nThai has five tones, mid, high, low, rising, and falling, and the reader is supposed to figure out what tone a syllable has based on the consonant class, whether it is a live syllable (meaning that it ends with a voiced consonant or long vowel) or a dead syllable (meaning that it ends with a voiceless consonant or a short vowel), and whether the vowel is long or short. When a syllable has a tone marker, different rules must apply alongside the ones already written above. \nThai borrowed some letters from loanwords of Sanskrit and Pali. Many of those letters sound or sounded differently in the languages they came from, but they now have the same pronunciation as other Thai sounds. Letters borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali are only used to write those same loanwords from those same languages.\nSpelling vs. pronunciation.\nThai words has a complicated relationship between spelling and their pronunciation. Many of the letters today have different sounds than when they were first used. While many Thai words have tone markers that show the tone of a word, many do not. However the word will still have a tone, and for words that do not have tone markers, one can still figure out the tone by the class of consonant (high, middle, or low), whether the syllable is a live or dead, syllable, and the length of the vowel. While the different classes of consonants made different phonemes, or distinct sounds, in the past, they now are set apart by which tones the words have.\nOther difficulties include silent letters and consonant mutations. For silent letters, the word \"chanthra\" (written as \u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c in Thai) would be pronounced \"chan\" when spoken\".\" Notice that the suffix \"-thra\", written as \u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c in Thai\",\" is missing in the phonetic spelling. That is because the Thai spelling is based on the Sanskrit spelling of the word, the language where the word comes from. Many loanwords in Thai are based on the spelling rules of the language they came from rather than their Thai pronunciation. Also, Thai words cannot end in any consonant that is not a nasal consonant, semivowel, or voiceless stop, the final consonants that are not either one of those mutate so that they can become pronounceable in Thai. For example, the word \"wat\" (meaning \"temple\") is spelled as \"wad\" (written as \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14 in Thai), but since \"-d\", or \u0e14, is a voiced alveolar stop, it must be pronounced as the voiceless alveolar stop \"-t.\" Also, the name Bhumibol (written as \u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25 in Thai) is pronounced as \"Phumiphon.\" The alveolar lateral approximant \"-l\" ,or \u0e25, must be pronounced as the alveolar nasal \"-n. The\" English loanword \"bus\" (written as \u0e1a\u0e31\u0e2a in Thai) is pronounced \"bat\" in Thai. The voiceless alveolar fricative \"-s\" , or \u0e2a, must be pronounced as the voiceless alveolar stop \"-t\"."}

French was once President of a group called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. French defended an Arab University Professor who was fired for saying \"Death to Israel\" on the grounds that hatred of Israel was not a good enough reason to fire someone. Then a woman named Bari Weiss made a documentary called Columbia Unbecoming accusing several professors at Columbia University of anti-Semitism. The New York Civil Liberties Union accused Weiss of being opposed to allowing Professors to have their rights to their own opinions saying that a student should only challenge a professor's opinion if the professor allows them to. Weiss then wrote to David French, President of the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education asking if this were true. French came to Weiss's defence saying that Professors were allowed to have their opinions about Israel, but that Weiss was not saying that they could not, only that students were also allowed to have their own opinions about it, that yes professors could choose what they wanted to talk about but that no students did not need their professors' permission to disagree with what they said and that yes Bari Weiss had said she was angry about every Columbia Professor in the Middle East department being against Israel but that she wasn't saying that they should be fired for that only that Columbia should hire at least some teachers who were pro-Israel and that she was not telling the government that they should force Columbia to hire at least some pro-Israel professors but she was saying that Columbia should hire more pro-Israel professors.\nFrench is a religious Christian and a Republican. French is Pro-Life and supported George W. Bush during his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, French joined the US Army and fought in Iraq as an American soldier. After coming back to the US he became the lawyer for the National Review Institute and would also sometimes write for the National Review.\nIn 2016, David French said that didn't want Donald Trump to be the Republican candidate for President but that if he were, he'd vote for him. Also in 2016, people on the Alt-Right said that French was a traitor to his race because he had adopted a black daughter. When Trump became the Republican candidate, French said that he had changed his mind and wouldn't vote for him because he wasn't critical enough of the Alt-Right. People on the Alt-Right then tweeted pictures of David French's daughter in a gas chamber. After Trump won, French supported the effort to investigate Trump for having secretly worked with the Vladimir Putin government to get himself elected. After the investigation was over, French said it seemed very unlikely that Trump had actually done it.\nFrench also complained about how often newspapers and television said people had been \"credibly accused\" of rape saying that most of the people who worked for Trump had been accused of rape without any evidence but that the media insisted that they'd been credibly accused. French also criticised the newspaper, The Atlantic for having fired Kevin Williamson, saying that the reason Williamson was fired was for being a conservative. French also criticised people for saying or implying that Ben Shapiro was Alt-Right. French also complained about people saying that Shapiro was racist on the grounds that people who hated Shapiro took things that he had said and apologised for to prove that he was racist when actually reading or watching Shapiro's books and videos would make it clear that he wasn't. French also criticised Glenn Greenwald for saying that Bari Weiss had devoted her life to trying to get professors who criticized Israel fired, saying that he knew Greenwald's statement wasn't true because he was there. French also praised Jordan Peterson saying that Peterson's book helped a lot of people realise how important the Bible was. French also said that YouTube should not have stopped Steven Crowder from making money from his videos but that the government should not stop YouTube from being able to make that choice. French said that Prager University did a lot of good work but he criticised Dennis Prager for being too pro-Trump. French said that he liked Trump's Pro-Life laws but that he believed George W. Bush did more for the Pro-Life movement. French supported Trump's decision to kill Iran's General Qassam Solemeini saying that Solemeini was an acceptable military target that it was not ,in fact, an assassination, under the law's definition.\nAn essay by a conservative named Sohrab Ahmari called Against David Frenchism accused David French of being a RINO (Republican in Name Only). When asked on Twitter what the most controversial opinion he had was, French said it was that superhero movies based on DC Comics were better than those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."}

Some phones and other devices support Mophun. Sony Ericsson phones, especially the Sony Ericsson T300 and Sony Ericsson T610, are the best known devices for running Mophun. It was designed by Synergenix Interactive. Most Mophun programs are around 50\u2013150 kB in size.\nPrograms for Mophun are written in assembler in C and C++ using a well-documented and open API. A special version of GCC is used to compile programs.\nDespite the API being very easy for programmers to use, Mophun has not been very popular. The main reason for this seems to be the strict approval process - the compiled program can only be run under an emulator, and Synergenix must approve the program so it can be used on a mobile device. The approved program can only be run under one IMEI number. Only developers registered and approved by Synergix can use self-certification (and through the Synergenix server), and they are only allowed to have one IMEI number. The developer must sign a sales contract with Synergenix, which then shares and approves it for end-users, so the program can be shared. Such a process disallows free programs to be created for Mophun, and also discourages many developers from developing programs for Mophun."}

It is located in the foothills of Altai mountains, at the site of the exit of thermal Radon baths.\nTerritory: 92.3 km per square.\nHistory.\nThe southern part of the resort town is bordered by the spurs of the ridge, which is covered with coniferous vegetation and shrubs: mountain ash, and bird cherry. In the vicinity of the city, acclimatized plants, that are uncharacteristic of the south of Western Siberia, such as oak and Manchurian walnut, are widespread.\nIn the 1920s, a resort village was founded on the site of the village of New Belokurikha. An office, a canteen, an outpatient clinic, and a solarium were built here, and in 1928 a hydropathic center for 24 baths and a polyclinic was built, and wooden dormitory buildings were erected between 1931-1934. The leaders of the Soviet state and their wives were resting here, as was the Russian writer K.G. Paustovsky.\nIn 1942, the all-Union pioneer camp Artek was evacuated to Belokurikha.\nIn the 1960s, most of the resorts were built, in which guests of the resort were treated and able to rest. The first in 1961 sanatorium, now called Eden, was commissioned. \nIn 1970, the village receives the status of a resort of all-union significance, in 1982 - the status of a city, and since 1992 it has been a resort of federal significance.\nIn 2003 and 2016, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin visited the resort.\nResort.\nIn 2015, 219,000 tourists visited Belokurikha.\nHealing factors.\nClimatotherapy.\nIt is characterized by a relatively high average annual air temperature (+4\u00b0 C) for Siberia. Mild winters, non-hot summers, warm weather in spring and autumn months, mostly windless, short-term frosts in winter, alternating with frequent thaws and constant barometric pressure.\nMountain air.\nLight air ions are the main healing component of mountain air. In Belokurikha, the content of light air ions is from 1014 to 2400, which is twice their content in the world-famous Swiss resort of Davos. Increased air ionization is especially noted on adjacent hills and terraces.\nThermal waters.\nSources in Belokurikha are thermal nitrogen-siliceous radon-containing waters or nitrogen therms. They surface at a temperature of 30\u00b0 C and 42\u00b0 C. They contain a small amount of radon, a lot of nitrogen, fluorine, and silicic acid, as well as various trace elements (Alkaline and mineral water). Healing mud from salt lakes of the Altai Territory is also used.\nSkiing.\nAt the beginning of 2010, the resort had three main ski slopes equipped: Katun, the central slope of the resort, measuring 800 meters long, Severny at 650 meters long, and mount, at 2050 meters long.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918. The prize was for his invention of the Haber\u2013Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesise ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. He is also considered the \"father of chemical warfare.\" This is because Haber spent years of work developing and making chlorine and other poisonous gases into weapons during World War I.\nHaber was born in Breslau, Prussia (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland). He was Jewish. When he was a young man, he moved to Berlin and learned to be a chemist. He wanted to be German and became a German nationalist.\nToday, people argue over whether Haber was a good man or a bad man. He invented weapons and poisons that killed many people, but he also invented fertilizers that allowed farms to grow so much food that many humans today are not afraid of famine.\nHaber figured out how to make ammonia using nitrogen and hydrogen. This was important because ammonia can be used to make fertilizer that makes crop plants grow. Before this, people dug nitrates out of the ground or had bird feces shipped all over the world to farmers, and the bird feces was being used up faster than the birds could replace it. After Haber learned to make ammonia, people could make as much fertilizer as they wanted. They said Haber had made \"bread from the air.\"\nPeople can also use ammonia to make explosives and poisons. During World War I, Haber studied how to use his inventions for weapons. Experts say Germany lasted one year long in World War I than it would have without Haber's poisons and explosives. Haber said he did not think killing a soldier with poison gas was any worse than by letting the soldier bleed to death. During World War I, Haber's first wife killed herself.\nWhen Hitler took over Germany in 1933, his Nazi party made laws that took freedom and property away from Jews. Haber left Germany in 1934. On 29 January 1934, he died of a heart attack in Basel, Switzerland. He was 64. a\nAfter Haber's death, the Nazis would use one of his inventions, a pesticide called Zyklon-B to kill Jews and captured Allied nationals in the Holocaust."}

He was called Ivan the Terrible because in those days the word terrible meant \"formidable\" or \"fearsome\", not \"really bad\". This is comes from his Russian nickname \"Ivan Grozny\", which also means \"Ivan the Formidable\".\nLife.\nIvan became the Grand Prince of Moscow when he was just three years old. When he was young, a group of Russian nobles ran the country in his place. In those days, Russia was divided into many kingdoms like Moscow. At the age of 16, Ivan and his government changed his title to Tsar of all Russia. Over the next few years, Ivan took full control of the government and conquered lands to the east of the Tatars. He began turning Russia from a divided group of kingdoms into an empire with one powerful ruler, at the cost of many lives.\nWars.\nIn 1558-63, Russia fought countries to the west in the Livonian War. They lost lands around the Baltic Sea to the west, but the war gave Ivan more control over his own country. Ivan was harsh towards the Russian nobles (known as the \"boyars\"). He executed many and took lands from others in order to make himself more powerful. This was known as the \"oprichnina\", and it was done by his private army called the \"Oprichniks\". In 1570 Ivan and the Oprichniks also killed many people in Novgorod, a city he thought was not being loyal to him. Later in his reign, Russia had battles with the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and Tatars and conquered more lands to the east, including Siberia. Ivan also increased trade with England and set up Russia's first printing press.\nIvan was known to get very angry at times. His behaviour seems to have varied a lot, as he could at times be intelligent and quiet. His mental health became worse in the second half of his reign, especially after the death of his first wife Anastasia in 1560. It is believed that during one of his rages he caused the death of his son and heir Ivan as well as the same son's unborn son. His other son Feodor would be the next Tsar. Feodor was a weak ruler, and this led to a war called the Time of Troubles."}

By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved.\nSocial distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets (cough or sneeze), physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air.

Most antivirals do not cause much damage to the body, and can be used to treat infections.

Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are microbicidal, while those that merely stop their growth are called biostatic. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is called antimicrobial prophylaxis.\nThe main types of antimicrobial agents are disinfectants (such as bleach), which kill a wide range of microbes on non-living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, antiseptics (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and antibiotics (which kill microorganisms within the body). The term \"antibiotic\" originally described only those creations that came from living microorganisms but is now also applied to synthetic agents, such as sulfonamides or fluoroquinolones. The term also used to be only applied to antibacterials, but its meaning has widened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further grouped into bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents, which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go past simply stopping germ growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been made to kill microbes on contact."}

The province made BC Hydro in 1962 to take over when the old company ran out of money.\nIn 1979, the government made the Urban Transit Authority, to plan and make rules for public transit; and the Metro Transit Operating Company, a separate crown corporation that actually ran the buses.

Outside Victoria, the bus schedules and routes are made by BC Transit but the buses are driven by other companies. In four places (Nanaimo, Nelson, Powell River, and the Sunshine Coast) the towns run the buses.\nHandyDART.\nBC Transit runs buses for people who have difficulty getting around. These buses are called paratransit and people call for the service to pick them up and drop them off ahead of time.\nHealth Connections.\nBecause lots of small towns don't have hospitals and doctors, there are also some buses that run from small towns into big cities. These buses don't run often, but they're still very important."}

A few seconds after she falls to the ground, D.W. cries and goes to her mother. Her mother says to Arthur: \"Arthur Timothy Read, come here!\". Arthur then says, \"Uh-oh. Middle name.\" After that, his mother carries Arthur and tells him, \u201cApologize to your sister now!\" but Arthur says no. In the living room, his dad tells Arthur: \"Arthur, this means no TV for a week.\"\nArthur tells his parents it is not fair. Later at school, Arthur tells all his friends. Eventually, the tough customers tell Binky to punch Arthur in the arm the next time he sees him. \nBinky does not want to, so he comes up with a plan not to look at Arthur ever again. However, while walking with his friends, Binky sees Arthur at the playground and they tell him to punch him. Then, he gives into the peer pressure and punches Arthur in the arm and Arthur runs home. Later, he apologizes to D.W. and their relationship goes back to normal."}

It is type of marketing that is done online and has a effect on offline business. It is done online, using things like search engines, social media, email, and other websites to connect with current and potential customers. \nBecause computers and cell phones are used more now, marketing has changed. Now businesses are using the Internet to market their product or services.\nDigital Marketing is different from traditional marketing. Traditional marketing uses offline channels, while digital marketing uses online channels. A traditional marketing campaign, for example, may use billboards, radio ads, and news stories, while a digital marketing campaign may use social media, blog posts, and email to promote a business and its offerings.\nHistory.\nThe word \"digital marketing\" first came in 1990s and first internet ad in 1994. Today, digital marketing has become an essential part of advertising with many institutions offering courses due to this demand."}

It is calculated by taking the n-th root of the product of these numbers. What most people refer to when they talk about mean or average is the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is almost always smaller than the arithmetic mean. In some cases, it is equal. The geometric mean is often used in finance and in statistics.\nBecause there's a product, it does not make sense to calculate the geometric mean if one of the numbers is zero. It generally also does not make much sense to calculate it when one of them is a negative number. It isn't used for complex numbers, because calculating the root of a complex number has more than one result."}

Today, due to the very high price of the gum spice and the difficulty of obtaining it, there are ice cream sellers who usually replace it with glucose or other ice cream conducive to appear as a sticky dish.\nhistory.\nMastic ice cream was first invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire and was called: \"Dondurma\" and it has been around for 300 years when its recipe was kept secret for many years. there are places in Turkey where it is customary to put the ice cream in a large container equipped with huge spoons for constant stirring, so that you do not over-firm, and serve it in a plate with a knife and fork. The ice cream is very popular in Turkey and there are even street stalls especially for Turkish Mastic ice cream where they pour boiling chocolate syrup over an ice cream cup. there are ice cream vendors who practice juggling and street shows for tourists with ice cream because of its great flexibility and resistance to melting. The ice cream's massive publicity in Turkey has made Istanbul's neighborhood known as \"Dondorma\".\nSyrian ice cream.\nIn the middle of the 19th century a Syrian merchant brought the secret recipe of ice cream from Turkey to Damascus, where he developed a softer local version of ice cream called \"Booza\", which is lighter And airy from the Turkish version, and from there it was distributed to Arab countries. in the Middle East only sells the Arabic version of the ice cream, while in the Far East only the Turkish version of the ice cream sells."}

It was first introduced on May 22, 2019 on the cover of Edge magazine. Panic worked with Teenage Engineering, a Swedish consumer electronics company, to design the Playdate.\nThe Playdate has a black-and-white 1-bit screen, 4 way directional pad, two game buttons, and a mechanical crank on the side.\nTechnical specifications.\nThe Playdate will allow games that are not part of a season to be sideloaded without needing to jailbreak it. Games are made using an SDK that comes with a simulator and debugger and works with C and Lua, which are programming languages. It is only available with the developer kit for Mac. However, in a response, Playdate said they are open to creating software for Windows, and compiling is already available, and the simulator is a work in progress.\nThe screen technology used is Sharp's Memory LCD, which has some features of e-paper displays. Each pixel can remember if it is black or white without having to be refreshed, resulting in faster refreshing and lower power usage, whilst also being \"viewable in any light, from edge-of-vision darkness to brightest sunlight\" and having a wide 170\u00b0 viewing angle.\nGames.\nGames for the handheld will come out in 12-game \"seasons\". A new game will sent over Wi-Fi every week. Each game's contents will be kept secret until the week it comes out, and will be automatically downloaded. The first season of games are included in the price of the console. Video games are made by Panic, and notable indie game developers such as Keita Takahashi, Zach Gage, Bennett Foddy, Shaun Inman, and Chuck Jordan. Future game titles include \"Crankin's Time Travel Adventure\", \"b360\", \"Zipper\", \"Executive Golf DX, Snak, and Sasquatchers\".\nIdeals.\nIn a developer survey, Panic said they would like to include games by underrepresented developers, and said season one contains games by women, and games by \"queer/trans/enby\" people.\nCriticism.\nIn May 2019, Panic was told off after the details of an email they had sent to an indie video game event that was also named Playdate should change its name to avoid confusion. The next day, one of Panic's founders cancelled the request, saying \"My intention was always to find a way for our Playdates to co-exist [...] but we remain fine with you using the name Playdate.\" On January 29, 2020, the team behind the event (now named \"Playdate Pop Up\") announced Panic was joining the event as a sponsor, and would help the event to be considered as non-profit."}

He gives it to a girl named Mary and her father, Cletus Spuckler, thinks that Bart wants to marry her. Jeff Westbrook won a Writers Guild of America Award for writing the episode.\nStory.\nBart and Lisa watch a cartoon called \"Transclown-O-Morphs.\" The main character tells kids to buy their new cereal to survive an emergency. Marge gets annoyed by the commercials and wants the kids to get away from TV. She gets Lisa to make banana bread and Bart to go to Shelbyville with Homer to have bean bag chairs \"rebeaned.\" While driving, they see Martin Prince driving a combine harvester. Bart asks him why he would drive a combine harvester, and Martin says he joined 4-H. Bart joins and learns how to drive a tractor. A 4-H volunteer tells the members about a competition. He says you have to pick a calf and raise it over the summer, and the cattle will be judged at a county fair.\nBart gets stuck with a weaker cow and can not trade it away. He meets Mary, who gets Bart to not give up on the competition. Through the competition, Bart takes good care of the cow, which he names Lou, and makes him stronger and starts loving him. At the judging, Lou has grown up into a bull and is given a blue ribbon as an award. Bart is very happy until Lisa tells him that Lou will then be sent to a slaughterhouse.\nBart wants Marge and Homer to buy Lou, but do not want to because it is expensive. At night, Bart starts hearing mooing and thinks he is hallucinating, but Lisa tells him it is just a CD of animal sounds that she started playing. Bart, Lisa, and two friends, named Compost and Solar Panel, go to the slaughterhouse at midnight to save Lou. They find Lou and see that he has been fed growth hormone pills and is much bigger, so they use a forklift to move him away from the slaughterhouse. They decide that they should take Lou to Mary's house because it is on a farm. The next morning, they discover that Mary's father is Cletus Spuckler.\nBart gives Lou to Mary. Cletus yells for Brandine, Cletus' wife, to come to the door. Brandine learns about Bart giving Lou to Mary, so she tells Bart that giving a cow means that he has made a proposal of arranged marriage. Bart and Mary do not want a marriage, but Cletus and Brandine plan a wedding for the next day. Lisa tells Bart to go along with it so that they have enough time to figure out how to save Lou because she thinks that Cletus will not keep Lou if Bart doesn't want to get married to Mary. Homer and Marge learn about the wedding and are shocked, but Marge agrees to save Lou because Bart cares deeply for Lou. The next day, Marge stops the wedding and tells Cletus to send Lou to the slaughterhouse. However, Cletus ends up sending Homer in disguise as Lou. The real Lou is sent to India because cows have a sacred status in India. They then save Homer from the slaughterhouse after he nearly gets killed. Homer promises to eat less meat, and Bart says with pride that \"I had a cow, man.\"\nReception.\nRichard Keller of TV Squad thought that the episode was another good episode of The Simpsons that feature Bart and Lisa together and says that \"episodes that center around Bart and Lisa tend to be more interesting...because those characters have more dimensions, and their diverse personalities and passions [show that] there is more to explore about them.\" Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode in a special way and was surprised by some plot elements, giving the episode a 7.5 out of 10. Matt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons\", said that this episode was his favorite of the series in a 2008 interview and said that the scene with Homer in the slaughterhouse was the part he liked best."}

It is also applied on groups who developed in part under the influence of Turkish culture and traditions while converting to Islam, especially during Ottoman times, such as Albanians, Bosniaks and other smaller ethnic groups around Balkans during the period of Ottoman rule. It can also refer to racism against Turkish people living outside of Turkey following the Turkish diaspora.\nThe main historic enemies of Turkic people are considered to be Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Serbians.\nThe roots of \"anti-Turkism\" can be traced back to the arrival of the Huns in Europe. While the ethnic background of the Huns is a matter of dispute among historians, they are widely believed to have been of Turkic origin, and their invasion inspired fear among Europeans.

Then Quinn\u2019s ex-boyfriend started a blog wherein he falsely accused her of having had sex with a male video game journalist in exchange for good reviews. That journalist pointed out that he had never reviewed the game at all and argued that the accusation made no sense. After that a lot of people still started to not only criticize, but also bullying Zoe Quinn on the Internet, including threatening to murder, rape or commit other kinds of violence against Quinn. When people came to Quinn\u2019s defence and said that the attacks against Quinn were proof of sexism against video game designers who were not male, they were accused of being social justice warriors (SJWs).

It was first shown on television on September 7, 2001. The episode played the song \"Sweet Victory\" by David Glen Eisley. In the episode, Squidward tells a lie to his high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson, that he has a marching band. He gets people from Bikini Bottom to join his band, but they play badly. Squidward quits the band, but SpongeBob gets the band together and practices for a big concert. Squidward thinks the concert will go wrong, but the concert is a success. The episode won the 2002 Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television \u2013 Animation.\nPlot.\nSquidward gets a call from his old high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson. Squilliam tells Squidward about his very good life and that he is doing everything Squidward wishes he could do. Squilliam then tells Squidward that his band will be performing at the Bubble Bowl. Squidward gets jealous and lies that he has a marching band and that it will play in the Bubble Bowl instead. After the call, Squidward quickly assembles a marching band with the people of Bikini Bottom.\nSquidward has one week to prepare a concert for the Bubble Bowl. The band plays badly through the training. On the first day, Patrick and Sandy get into a fight. On the second day, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast and crash into a blimp. On the third day, Plankton tries to play the harmonica, but the holes are bigger than he is and he gets tired of running to each hole. On the fourth (and last) day, the band plays too loudly, breaking the windows of the building. All of the band then gets into a fight. When class is over, Squidward goes over to the doors and says that he is disappointed in the band for fighting and no longer wants his band to play in the Bubble Bowl. Once Squidward leaves, SpongeBob tells everyone to go through and perform at the Bubble Bowl to make Squidward happy.\nOn the day of the concert, Squilliam finds Squidward at the Bubble Bowl entrance to see his band play poorly. Squidward says that his band died, but all of the band show up behind Squidward and say they are ready to perform. They enter a dome which takes them to the Bubble Bowl field. Squidward starts conducting with fear that the band will play poorly, but they play successfully. The band performs a song called \"Sweet Victory.\" At the end of the episode, Squilliam faints and Squidward leaps in the air with a cheerful face.\nReception.\nThe episode is largely said to be one of the best episodes of the show. Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, said it is one of his favorite episodes. Michael Cavna of \"The Washington Post\" said that Squidward's artistic traits and roles in the episode \"made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level.\" \"The Guardian\" said the episode is the second best episode of the show, behind the episode \"Krusty Krab Training Video\". The episode along with another season two episode, \"The Secret Box\", have the highest rating out of all of the other \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" on IMDb with a rating of 9.8 out of 10.\nSuper Bowl LIII.\nAfter Stephen Hillenburg, creator of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", died, a user on Change.org started a petition for the NFL to include the featured music \"Sweet Victory\" on the halftime of Super Bowl LIII. The petition got 1.1 million signatures on January 11, 2019. On December 18, 2018, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the stadium used for Super Bowl LIII, posted a scene from the episode on their Twitter page. On January 13, Maroon 5 released a video on Twitter that had a SpongeBob SquarePants episode included for a second.\nDuring the halftime show, a short animation showing Squidward and the scene with the trumpet fanfare was used to introduce Travis Scott, a guest singer for the halftime show. Many fans of SpongeBob were mad because the NFL did not play the full song. However, \"Sweet Victory\" increased 566% on on-demand streaming when shown on the halftime show. Because of this, the song entered \"Billboard\"'s United States Hot Rock Songs chart at number 23 and the Kid Digital Song Sales chart at number two, behind Pinkfong's \"Baby Shark.\""}

In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.\nSeveral countries planned to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans were different. The United Kingdom used its National Health Service. Canada used its military. The United States sent vaccines to all fifty states and the state governments each made their own system.\nThe United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8, 2020. The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City. By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.\nBackground.\nIn late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)which is organizing a billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidatesindicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. On 4May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021.\nPittCoVacc.\nPittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States. It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read.\nAs of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings.\nPittCoVacc is short for \"Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine\".\nMaking PittCoVacc.\nOne of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: \"We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from.\"\nThe researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array, meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine. The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it. It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies.\nThe scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.\nAPN01.\nAnother team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. These are human cells put together to act like part of the body, but they are not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called \"human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2\" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01.\nMessenger RNA vaccines.\nOther scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines.\nMessenger RNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures. Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough.\nModerna vaccine.\nIn mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodiesbut they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.\nThe Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020. That means it is being tested on humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous.\nOn November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective. The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. Distribution began in February 2021.\nTozinameran.\nThe German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020. The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020. Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team was trying to do both phases at once. If the companies could make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government would give them almost US$2 billion. The vaccine is called BNT162b2. BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work. They called this \"Project Lightspeed\" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly.\nBecause they wanted people to trust the vaccine Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work.\nOn November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves.\nAdenovirus vaccines.\nThe adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca).\nIn late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.\nThe team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.\nAd5-nCOV.\nThe Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military.\nJohnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.\nThe Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.\nCoronaVac.\nThe company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took SARS-CoV-2 and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac.\nSinopharm vaccine.\nThe company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.\nThis vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.\nBacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trial.\nThe University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19.\nNasal vaccines.\nScientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines.\nStatistics.\nAs of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people. \nAfrican Americans are less likely to get vaccinated than other Americans, as are people in the Southern United States."}

When he was captain of the aircraft carrier \"Theodore Roosevelt\", he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19, a disease that affects the lungs and breathing. Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the \"Theodore Roosevelt\" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. \nIn late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the \"Theodore Roosevelt\".\nCareer.\nBrett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003. He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College. He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the \"USS Ronald Reagan\". Brett Crozier was captain of the \"USS Blue Ridge\" from June 2017 to November 2018.\nLetters.\nHe wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper \"San Francisco Chronicle\" on March 31, 2020.\nCOVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the \"Diamond Princess\" cruise ship, and said that even though the \"Diamond Princess\"'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected. He said the \"Theodore Roosevelt\" only had a few private rooms.\nRetired Admiral James Stavridis, who used to be NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, agreed that it was not possible to perform social distancing on board a navy ship like the \"Theodore Roosevelt\".\nFiring.\nHigh-ranking leaders at the Navy said that removing Crozier from his ship was normal. They said Crozier should have asked for help by going through the chain of command instead of writing letters to other people in the military.\nAccording to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: \"It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job.\"\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", \"a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship.\"\nKathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other."}

It was founded in 1889. \nIts population ranks fifth of all the Colorado cities. It ranks 172nd (in population) out of all the cities in the United States. \nIn 2010, the population was 142,980. \nAccording to the United States Census in 2010, the city population was 142,980. Lakewood is to the west of Denver, Colorado's capital. It is one of the key cities of the Denver\u2013Aurora\u2013Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor.\nHistory.\nThis urban and suburban community was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and W.A.H. Loveland; who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland used to be the president of the Colorado Central Railroad and lived in Golden. After retiring, he moved to the new area known as Lakewood.\nUp until 1969, this area known as Lakewood didn't have a city government. Instead, they relied on water districts, fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. This area known as Lakewood was more of a community and had been around for 80 years. Police protection was provided to them by the Jefferson County Sheriff and volunteers from fire districts. \nIn 1969, the City of Lakewood was legally turned into Jefferson City. Not too long after, they held an election. They decided to change the city's name to Lakewood because the majority disliked \"Jefferson City,\" and believes it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At this time, the population was already over 90,000.\nLakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route that joined Denver with the Rocky Mountains. Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. Originally, in Lakewood, there was only the Jewish Conspumtive Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, a small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange. However, by the 1950s, grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots could be found as well.

Green Mountain, a mesa tall, is located in the far west-central part of the city.\nLakewood is located in the watershed of the South Platte River. Several small tributaries of the river flow east through it. From north to south, this includes Lakewood Gulch, Weir Gulch, Sanderson Gulch, and Bear Creek. Two tributaries of Lakewood Gulch, Dry Gulch and McIntyre Gulch, flow east through the northern part of the city. Turkey Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, flows northeast through the far southwestern part of the city. In addition, Lena Gulch, a tributary of Clear Creek to the north, flows east then north through the extreme northwestern part of the city.\nSeveral small lakes and reservoirs are in Lakewood. The Soda Lakes lie in the far southwestern part of the city. East of them lies Bear Creek Lake, a reservoir fed by Bear Creek and Turkey Creek. Clustered near each other in central Lakewood are Main Reservoir, East Reservoir, Smith Reservoir, Kendrick Lake, and Cottonwood Lake. Northeast of them lies Kountze Lake. In the northwestern part of the city, Lena Gulch both feeds and drains Maple Grove Reservoir. In the far southern part of the city lies Bowles Reservoir No. 1 and, just outside the city limits to the reservoir's northeast, Marston Lake.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Of which are land and (2.7%) are covered by water.\nAs a suburb of Denver, Lakewood is part of both the greater Denver metropolitan area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. It borders other communities on all sides, including Wheat Ridge to the north, Edgewater to the northeast, Denver to the east and southeast, Dakota Ridge to the south, Morrison to the southwest, and Golden, West Pleasant View, East Pleasant View, and Applewood to the northwest.\nClimate.\nLakewood experiences a semiarid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\") with winters tha fluctuate between mild to cold and snowy while summers are warm to hot, with great temperature differences (about 30\u00b0F) between day and night year round.

It was first shown on television on the Fox network on March 8, 2020. In the episode, Marge wants the family to lower their screen time. However, she later finds out she needs to lower her screen time the most. The episode was dedicated to James Lipton who died on March 2, 2020, six days before the episode was shown on television. He guest starred in the episodes \"The Sweetest Apu\" and \"Homer the Father\".\nPlot.\nThe Simpsons family is watching a murder show on TV. Lisa sees Maggie trying to get their attention so she changes the channel to a show that teaches babies sign language. Maggie was trying to tell them that Hans Moleman is stuck under a tree that fell, but the family does not notice. In the morning, they keep watching the show and Hans is taken to an ambulance.\nThe show is cancelled because the government stopped funding the show, so Marge tries teaching Maggie sign language herself. Marge tries to tell the family about Maggie's development, but the family is too busy on their devices. Marge decides to limit everyone's screen time to half an hour a week. \nMarge catches Homer, Bart, and Lisa having their screen time changed by a technician, so she puts away the devices completely. Homer is bored at work, so he starts playing word puzzles in a newspaper. Marge sees how strong devices are affecting Patty and Selma. Bart uses his imagination at school when he gets a toy rocket down from the school roof. Lisa gets the feeling of joy when she finds books from the library without using devices.\nMarge can not find the recipe she is looking for, so when the family comes back home, they find her in the closet with her phone and laptop. Marge admits that she is the one who is addicted to devices. She signs the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center, a place to treat screen addictions.\nThe next day, they get in to the center and find out it is a pleasant place. The owner, Dr. Lund, shows them around the place and what you can do. The family starts to recover, but they can not hold back for long. They find the workers all using computers and sending spam mail after stealing the patients' accounts. The family can not leave because they signed a non-disclosure contract which does not let them leave the center.\nAt night, the family uses sign language to communicate with each other and escape the center. The next day, Dr. Lund is arrested for scamming.\nReception.\nDennis Perkins of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a score of B- and says that \"there's not enough else to recommend 'Screenless,' as the Simpsons\u2019 individual journeys through the hell of online withdrawal are short-changed and unsatisfying.\" \"Den of Geek\" gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars and says that the episode \"is a sweet episode because it promises that families can be in the same room as each other and still be together.\""}
