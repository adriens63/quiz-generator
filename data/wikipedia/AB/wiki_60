It changes during the year. Usually, the ice melts in spring and summer, and increases during autumn and winter. The minimum cover is around mid-September. Summer ice cover in the Arctic is about half of winter cover. Some of the ice survives from one year to the next. Currently, 28% of Arctic basin sea ice is multi-year ice. Multi-year ice is thicker than seasonal ice: up to thick over large areas, with ridges up to thick. As well as the regular seasonal cycle there has been an underlying trend of declining sea ice in the Arctic in recent decades.\nClimatic importance.\nEnergy balance effects.\nSea ice is important for the heat balance of the polar oceans: it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above. With ice, less heat is lost from the oceans. Sea ice is highly reflective of solar radiation, reflecting about 60% of incoming solar radiation when bare and about 80% when covered with snow. This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect. This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%). The ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface.\nHydrological effects.\nThe sea ice cycle is also an important source of dense (saline) \"bottom water\". When sea water freezes it leaves most of its salt content behind. The remaining surface water, made dense by the extra salinity, sinks and produces dense water masses such as North Atlantic Deep Water. This production of dense water is essential in maintaining the thermohaline circulation, and the accurate representation of these processes is important in climate modelling.\nOdden.\nThe Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea is an area where so-called pancake ice is the most common type of ice. Odden means headland in Norwegian. During the winter, it grows eastward from the East Greenland ice edge around 72\u00b0N to 74\u00b0N. The Jan Mayen Current brings some very cold polar surface water, which it takes from the East Greenland Current. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as frazil and pancake in the rough seas.\nChanges in size and volume of sea ice.\nRecords of Arctic Sea ice from the United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research go back to the turn of the 20th century. Before 1950, the data is not as good as after 1950. Reliable measurements of sea ice edge begin within the satellite era. From the late 1970s, there were different satellites that could provide data which was independent of solar illumination or weather conditions. The frequency and accuracy of passive microwave measurements improved with the launch of the DMSP F8 Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) in 1987. Both the sea ice area and extent are estimated. The latter is lager, as it is defined as the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice.\nA modeling study of the 52-year period from 1947 to 1999 found a statistically significant decrease in Arctic ice volume of 3% per decade, caused by an increase in tempertature. A computer-based, time-resolved calculation of sea ice volume, fitted to various measurements, revealed that monitoring the ice volume is much more important for evaluating sea ice loss than pure area considerations.\nThe trends from 1979 to 2002 have been a statistically significant Arctic sea ice decrease of 2.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% per decade during those 23 years. Climate models simulated this trend in 2002. The September minimum ice extent trend for 1979\u20132011 declined by 12.0% per decade during 32 years. In 2007 the minimum extent fell by more than a million square kilometers, the biggest decline since accurate satellite data has been available, to . New research shows the Arctic Sea ice to be melting faster than predicted by any of the 18 computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in preparing its 2007 assessments. In 2012, a new record low of about was reached.\nIn the overall mass balance, the volume of sea ice depends on the thickness of the ice as well as the area covered. While the satellite era has enabled better measurement of trends in area, accurate ice thickness measurements remain a challenge. \"Nonetheless, the extreme loss of this summer\u2019s sea ice cover and the slow onset of freeze-up portends lower than normal ice extent throughout autumn and winter, and the ice that grows back is likely to be fairly thin\". As more and more of the sea ice is thinner first-year ice the greater effect storms have on its stability with turbulence resulting from major extratropical cyclones resulting in extensive fractures of sea ice."}

The problems get worse when they knock on the door of sleazy pornography director Maxxx Orbison. Several security guards are sent to throw Joseph and his partner away. But Joseph, or Joe, defeats them singlehanded with his own martial arts skills. Orbison is impressed by Joe's performance. He (Orbison) is also bored with the lead actor of his current project. Orbison tries hiring Joe to be the lead character of his pornographic superhero movie, \"Orgazmo\". Joe is confused due to his God beliefs. However, the salary offered would pay for his Utah wedding to his fianc\u00e9e Lisa. Joe doesn't want to accept, though he accepts anyway.\nJoe finds the crew of the movie very threatening. But he manages to become friends with his co-star Ben Chapleski. Ben is a technical genius. He works in the pornography industry. Ben plays Orgazmo's partner Choda Boy. Choda assists Orgazmo with some specially designed sex toys. The toys include Orgazmo's main weapon, the Orgazmorator. The Orgazmorator is a ray gun that, when fired, causes orgasms upon whomever it is fired. Ben invites Joe to his home later on. He (Ben) shows Joe a real and working Orgazmorator Ben has built. Ben and Joseph spend an evening using the weapon on unknowing citizens for amusement. \nAt a sushi bar owned by Ben's Japanese friend G-Fresh, the two witness a group of thugs. The thugs vandalize the bar and try to force out G-Fresh. That's so their next door dance club can expand. \nLater, when Ben and Joe are not present, G-Fresh is asked to leave. Upon finding this out, Joe and Ben put on costumes. They use their movie props and the Orgaznmorator ro sneak into the club and steal back the contract that G-Fresh was forced into signing. Ben is excited by finally getting to be a real superhero.\nThe movie \"Orgazmo\" becomes a financial and critical success. Orbison withholds Joe's paycheck to keep him in town long enough so he can announce a sequel. Joe is tempted with a doubled salary. His fianc\u00e9e meets him angrily and then leaves him when she finds out what Joe's been doing. Joe faces production problems and harassment from Orbison's nephew A-Cup. Joe tries backing out the project. Orbison refuses, though. When Joe stands up to Orbison, the latter has Lisa kidnapped to force Joe into agreement. When Ben finds out the thugs who assaulted G-Fresh are also working for Orbison, he and Joe go into Orbison's mansion before Lisa can be forced into acting in one of Orbison's movies.\nRelease.\n\"Orgazmo\" was first shown at Toronto International Film Festival in Fall 1997. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the movie an NC-17 rating. That meant a limited release in the United States.\nReception.\n\"Orgazmo\" has a score of 50% under Rotten Tomatoes. The movie had a score of 48 out of 100 on the Metacritic, meaning \"average or mixed reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the movie half a star. Ebert called it \"Callow, obvious and awkward\".\nThe movie has been called a \"cult movie\", mostly by fans of \"South Park\"."}

He says \"nationalism\" is not the same as \"patriotism\", as patriotism \"is of its nature defensive... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable (hard to separate) from the desire for power.\"\nHe says that it can be \"positive,\" i.e. \"for\" something, such as one's country. Orwell says Celtic nationalism and Zionism are examples of this sort of nationalism. On the other hand, it can be \"negative\", i.e. \"against\" something, such as another group. Orwell says Anti-Soviet Trotskyism ans Antisemitism are examples of this sort.\n\"Transferred nationalism\" is a third kind. This is identification and promotion of a different race, social class, or country to your own.\nScotland.\nOrwell's claim that only Scottish nationalists think that using the Lowland Scottish language is important has been criticised by speakers of the language.\nOrwell's \"Notes on Nationalism\" have been used by people on the right-wing of Scottish politics (such as former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson) to argue against 'identity politics'."}

Between 1756 and 1780, she wrote political essays and news from abroad for newspapers under pseudonyms (false names). The false name she used in the newspapers \"Gazetteer\" and \"The Public Ledger\" was \"Probus\".\nShe was not famous in her lifetime, but she has become more well known in recent years. This is because she was one of the few women at that time who wrote essays on politics and trade. Back then, people thought those were men's areas of interest. Because of sexism, most people thought Forman's essays were written by men.\nScholars say her essays show great knowledge and morality. \nEarly life.\nForman's father was Irish Jacobite Charles Forman, and her mother was called Mary. Forman had five brothers and sisters. \nCharles Forman was a clerk in the English war office. When James Francis Edward Stuart tried become king of England, Ireland and Scotland (and make royal House of Stuart the rulers of these countries) in the Jacobite rising of 1715, Forman was late in sending orders to the English general Charles Wills, who was fighting the Jacobites. Therefore, we do not know whether Charlotte was born in England or France, but she did later write that she had been \"nursed in the palace of the Trianon\" in France. \nShe lived in London for most of her life in poverty, and went into debtors' prison for a short time in 1767.\nWriting career.\nForman wrote a many political essays for the \"Gazetteer\" and \"London Daily Advertiser\" between 1756 and 1760, then carried in in the \"Public Ledger\" in 1760. Both newspapers were for merchants, traders, and shopkeepers in London, and had information about to international trade, such as news about shipping and offers of wholesale and retail goods..\nForman's essays in the \"Gazetteer\" and the \"Public Ledger\", all signed as Probus, were written in the before and during the Seven Years' War. About 200 surviving essays comment on diplomatic news and general news reports, as well as looking into the interests of England, Prussia, France, Holland, Austria, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. She always supported the English war effort, and kept telling readers that England could defeat France, as well as defending Frederick the Great and William Pitt from critics. She also argued against an early peace, as she thought it would give France too much leeway.\nLetters written between her and with Radical satirist and politician John Wilkes have beensaid to give modern readers \"graphic evidence of the struggles of an independent woman in the 18th century attempting to support herself by writing\". She said she was a literary day labourer.\nShe is not known to have published anything under her own name, although there are many works published anonymously which now cannot be attributed."}

In anthropology, spallation is a process used to make stone tools by knapping. In nuclear physics, spallation is the process in which a heavy nucleus releases many nucleons because it has been hit by a high-energy particle, thereby reducing its atomic weight."}

They keep up breed standards (what they think the breed should be similar to) and make the rules for dog shows, and occasionally training programs (where the dog is trained to do a certain thing).\nExamples of kennel clubs include the American Kennel Club (or AKC), the Australian National Kennel Council, Canadian Kennel Club, (CKC), and The Kennel Club (United Kingdom).\nThere are a large selection of types of kennel clubs. They can be \"all-breed clubs\", (where there are a list of dogs they have decided to recognize), or a breed club which simply handles one breed.\nSometimes, a kennel club is only concerned with one race of dogs."}

It stretches from Main Road and Main Street to the Abberley Court Hotel at the end of High Street and encompasses the Village Green shopping plaza, Tallaght Courthouse, Westpark, and many shops, restaurants and banks. It also houses Tallaght Youth Service, Tallaght's first newspaper printing house the Tallaght Echo, and (formally) Tallaght Community Arts Centre. The area's Institute of Technology, Saint Mary's Priory, and Saint Maelruain's Church are located in the historic quarter of Tallaght village.\nThe newer \"town centre\" lies immediately to the south across the Belgard Road, encompassing Belgard Square, the main shopping complex (known as The Square Tallaght), the Luas Red Line terminus, Tallaght Hospital (including the National Children's Hospital), County Hall, the Civic Theatre, South Dublin County Library, Rua Red Arts Centre, the Cookstown Area near Maplewood and Springfield, and several bars, restaurants and hotels.\nTo the northeast of the village lies the Tymon North / Balrothery area, which comprised rural townlands until the 1970s. This district includes estates such as Bancroft, Balrothery, Glenview, Castle Park, Saint Aongus, Tymon, Bolbrook and Avonbeg. These parts are home to several sporting facilities, including the National Basketball Arena, a fitness centre, two swimming pools, an athletics track, and an astroturf football facility. Tymon Park is watered by the River Poddle and is Ireland's second-largest city park. It borders Greenhills and Templeogue, and it contains extensive sporting grounds, ponds, Col\u00e1iste De Hide and one of Ireland's largest playgrounds at the Tymon North entrance.\nOld Bawn is immediately south of the village, bordered by Sean Walsh Memorial (also locally called Watergate) Park. To the east of Old Bawn, estates include Home Lawns, Mountain Park, Millbrook Lawns and Seskin View. To the south and southwest of the village lie Kiltipper, Aylesbury, and Killinarden (the latter comprising the residential areas of Deerpark, Cushlawn and Elder Heath). Beyond these are rural lands, running towards the Dublin Mountains.\nIn the northwest is Belgard Green, with Belgard Heights and Kingswood (built 1974) to the north, Kingswood is also sometimes considered as Clondalkin as it half holds a Dublin 22 postcode. Half of Kingswood is served by Clondalkin Garda Station. Kingswood and Belgard Heights are adjacent to Clondalkin, while Kilnamanagh is situated beside Greenhills and south-west of Walkinstown and Crumlin. Tallaght Theatre is situated along Greenhills Road.\nIn the near north located is Fettercairn, thought by some to be in Jobstown, but not. Fettercairn is its own district of Tallaght.

Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.\nThe name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (a p-code machine i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.\nSince bytecode instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions: virtual stack machines are the most common, but virtual register machines have been built also. Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar to object modules, but dynamically loaded during execution.\nExecution.\nA bytecode program may be executed by parsing and \"directly\" executing the instructions, one at a time. This kind of \"bytecode interpreter\" is very portable. Some systems, called dynamic translators, or \"just-in-time\" (JIT) compilers, translate bytecode into machine code as necessary at runtime. This makes the virtual machine hardware-specific but does not lose the portability of the bytecode. For example, Java and Smalltalk code is typically stored in bytecode format, which is typically then JIT compiled to translate the bytecode to machine code before execution. This introduces a delay before a program is run, when the bytecode is compiled to native machine code, but improves execution speed considerably compared to interpreting source code directly, normally by around an order of magnitude (10x).\nBecause of its performance advantage, today many language implementations execute a program in two phases, first compiling the source code into bytecode, and then passing the bytecode to the virtual machine. There are bytecode based virtual machines of this sort for Java, Raku, Python, PHP, Tcl, mawk and Forth (however, Forth is seldom compiled via bytecodes in this way, and its virtual machine is more generic instead). The implementation of Perl and Ruby 1.8 instead work by walking an abstract syntax tree representation derived from the source code.\nMore recently, the authors of V8 and Dart have challenged the notion that intermediate bytecode is needed for fast and efficient VM implementation. Both of these language implementations currently do direct JIT compiling from source code to machine code with no bytecode intermediary.\nExamples.\n \u00bb&gt; import dis # \"dis\" - Disassembler of Python byte code into mnemonics.\n \u00bb&gt; dis.dis('print(\"Hello, World!\")')\n 1 0 LOAD_NAME 0 (print)\n 2 LOAD_CONST 0 ('Hello, World!')\n 4 CALL_FUNCTION 1\n 6 RETURN_VALUE"}

{"id": "797171", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797171", "title": "Lactic acid fermentation", "text": "Lactic acid fermentation is a metabolic process by which glucose or other monosaccharide sugars are converted into lactic acid and energy. There may also be other by-products of this fermentation. The process also works with other sugars, such as sucrose or lactose. Lactic acid bacteria use this process to get energy. Fungi, plants and animals will also use this process, if there is a lack of oxygen. As an example, it occurs in muscle cells.\u00a0With humans, it occurs if there's too little oxygen in the blood, known as Hypoxemia.\nThere are different types of lactic acid fermentation:\nAs a preservative.\nLactic acid fermentation is a way to preserve food, and make it last longer. It has been in use at least since the Paleolithic era. Fermentation will reduce the activity of the bacteria that make food go bad; it will also kill some of them. Examples are fermented milk products, such as yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, and tsukemono.\nHistory.\nDuring the 19th century, several of the fundamental concepts of organic chemistry were discovered. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac was interested in fermentation processes. One of his students was Justus von Liebig. Both independently described the chemical structure of the lactic acid molecule. Both were chemists, they were only interested in the chemical properties, and how to optimize it using chemical catalyzers. The French chemist Louis Pasteur was the first to describe lactic acid as a product of a microbial fermentation, in 1857. At the time he worked at the University of Lille. A local brewery asked him about some problems they had with fermentation. By chance he discovered that in this brewery, two fermentation processes were taking place: One was the lactic acid fermentation he had expected, the other was an alcoholic fermentation. Both were started by microorganisms.\nIn the 19th century, several chemists discovered some fundamental concepts of the domain of organic chemistry. One of them was the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who was especially interested in fermentation processes. He also passed this fascination to one of his best students, Justus von Liebig. With a difference of some years, each of them described the chemical structure of the lactic acid molecule as we know it today. Both Gay-Lussac and von Liebig had a purely chemical understanding of the fermentation process: in their view, the process can be optimized with chemical catalyzers; neither of them was interested in seeing it with a microscope. In 1857, the French chemist Louis Pasteur first described lactic acid as the product of a microbial fermentation. During this time, he worked at the university of Lille, where a local distillery asked him for advice concerning some fermentation problems. Per chance and with the badly equipped laboratory he had at that time, he discovered that in this distillery, two fermentations were taking place, a lactic acid one and an alcoholic one, both induced by microorganisms. He then continued the research on these discoveries in Paris, where he also published his theories which contradicted the purely chemical version represented by Liebig and his followers. Even though Pasteur described some concepts that are still accepted today, Liebig refused to accept them. But even Pasteur himself wrote that he was \"driven\" to a completely new understanding of this chemical phenomenon. Even if Pasteur didn't find every detail of this process, he still discovered the main mechanism of how the microbial lactic acid fermentation works. He was the first to describe fermentation as a \"form of life without air.\"\nPeople had been using microbial lactic acid fermentation to produce food long before Pasteur had described it. Archeological finds show that the fermentation of milk has a long history. Its first uses may have been part of the Neolithic Revolution. Milk contains lactic acid bacteria. Given the right temperature, the fermentation process will happen spontaneously. These first farmers likely had another problem: When people become adults most lose the ability to digest fresh milk. These farmers had an interest to make milk digestible by adults. Lactic acid bacteria contain the enzymes needed to digest lactose. During lactic acid fermentation, the number of lactic acid bacteria increase. So even if fermentation only happens for a short time, the product will contain enough enzymes, which allows the milk to be digested by adults. Even safer was a longer fermentation, which was practiced for cheesemaking. This process was also discovered a very long time ago, which is proven by recipes for cheese production on Cuneiform scripts, the first written documents that exist, and a bit later in Babylonian and Egyptian texts.\nWhat is interesting is the theory of the competitive advantage of fermented milk products. The idea of this theory is that the women of these first settled farmer clans could shorten the time between two children thanks to the additional lactose uptake from milk consumption. This factor may have given them an important advantage to out-compete the hunter-gatherer societies.\nSince they consumed more milk products, these societies developed lactase pesistence: The milk-digesting enzyme lactase was present in their body during the whole lifetime: They could also drink unfermented milk as adults. Even today there are regional differences: Estimates are that about 65% of the world polulation still lacks this enzyme. The first societies came from regions in eastern Turkey to central Europe; the gene is more common there, as well as in the United States, which was settled from Europe. In Asian countries, lactose intolerance is much more present.\nMilk products and their fermentation have had an important influence on some cultures\u2019 development. This is the case in Mongolia, where people often practice a pastoral form of agriculture. The milk that they produce and consume in these cultures is mainly mare milk and has a long tradition. But not every part or product of the fresh milk has the same meaning. The fattier part on the top, the \"dee\u017e\", is seen as the most valuable part and is therefore often used to honor guests.\nVery important with often a traditional meaning as well are fermentation products of mare milk, like for example the slightly-alcoholic yogurt kumis. Consumption of these peaks during cultural festivities such as the Mongolian lunar new year (in spring). The time of this celebration is called the \"white month\", which indicates that milk products (called \"white food\" together with starchy vegetables, in comparison to meat products, called \"black food\") are a central part of this tradition. The purpose of these festivities is to \"close\" the past year \u2013 clean the house or the yurt, honor the animals for having provided their food, and prepare everything for the coming summer season \u2013 to be ready to \"open\" the new year. Consuming white food in this festive context is a way to connect to the past and to a national identity, which is the great Mongolian empire personified by Genghis Khan. During the time of this empire, the fermented mare milk was the drink to honor and thank warriors and leading persons, it was not meant for everybody. Although it eventually became a drink for normal people, it has kept its honorable meaning. Like many other traditions, this one feels the influence of globalization. Other products, like industrial yogurt, coming mainly from China and western countries, have tended to replace it more and more, mainly in urban areas. However, in rural and poorer regions it is still of great importance.\nMajor species of lactose fermenting bacteria.\nSome major bacterial strains identified as being able to ferment lactose are in the genera \"Escherichia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter\" and \"Klebsiella .\" All four of these groups fall underneath the family of \"Enterobacteriaceae.\" These four species are able to be separated from each other by using biochemical testing. To distinguish between the species, simple biological tests are readily available. Apart from whole sequence genomics, common tests include H2S production, motility and citrate use, indol, methyl red and Voges-Proskauer tests.\nApplications.\nLactic acid fermentation is used in many areas of the world to produce foods that cannot be produced through other methods. The most commercially important genus of lactic acid-fermenting bacteria is \"Lactobacillus\", though other bacteria and even yeast are sometimes used. Two of the most common applications of lactic acid fermentation are in the production of yogurt and sauerkraut.\nSauerkraut.\nLactic acid fermentation is used in the production of sauerkraut. The main type of bacteria used in the production of sauerkraut is of the genus \"Leuconostoc\".\nAs in yogurt, when the acidity rises due to lactic acid-fermenting organisms, many other pathogenic microorganisms are killed. The bacteria produce lactic acid, as well as simple alcohols and other hydrocarbons. These may then combine to form esters, contributing to the unique flavor of sauerkraut.\nSour beer.\nLactic acid is a component in the production of sour beers, including Lambics and Berliner Weisses.\nYogurt.\nThe main method of producing yogurt is through the lactic acid fermentation of milk with harmless bacteria. Most often, the bacteria used are \"Lactobacillus bulgaricus\" and \"Streptococcus thermophilus\", and United States as well as European law requires all yogurts to contain these two cultures (though others may be added as probiotic cultures). These bacteria produce lactic acid in the milk culture, decreasing its pH and causing it to congeal. The bacteria also produce compounds that give yogurt its distinctive flavor. An additional effect of the lowered pH is the incompatibility of the acidic environment with many other types of harmful bacteria.\nFor a probiotic yogurt, additional types of bacteria such as \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\" are also added to the culture."}

He made his first appearance in the movie \"Shrek 2\" (2004), soon becoming Shrek's partner and helper (alongside Donkey). In the movie \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), Puss helps Shrek find the heir to the throne of the Far Far Away Kingdom. The movie \"Shrek Forever After\" (2010) is primarily set in an alternate universe, where Puss is Princess Fiona's pet and has gained weight after his retirement. In the spin-off and prequel \"Puss in Boots\", his origins are described. Puss also appears in the Netflix television series centered on him, \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\" (2015\u20132018).\nPuss was inspired by the title character of the fairy tale \"Puss in Boots\". His design, created by Tom Hester, was based on real cats. Several characters were used as inspirations for Puss's characterization, such as Zorro and Indiana Jones. The idea of Puss as the protagonist of a film was explored after his debut appearance. Antonio Banderas voices Puss in the English, Spanish, and Italian dubs of the \"Shrek\" franchise. While he initially tried a high-pitched voice for the character, he and the \"Shrek 2\" filmmakers decided on a tone that was deeper than his normal voice. Banderas said that voicing Puss was an important part of his career. Eric Bauza provides Puss's voice in \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\".\nThe character is well liked, with critics praising his depiction and considering him a source of comic relief.

According to the actor, he was chosen for the role of Puss because of his Spanish accent.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nCritical reception of Puss has been well liked, with reviewers praising him in the movies and describing him as \"cute\", \"suave\", \"lovable\", \"charismatic\", \"feisty\", \"engaging\", \"legendary\", \"an instant charmer\", \"a natural-born star\", \"a notorious adventurer\", the \"suavest of swashbuckling cats\", and \"the world's greatest feline swordfighter\". He was also regarded as \"smooth-talking\", \"heroic\", \"honorable\", self-confident, \"passionate\", loyal, with \"humble\" origins. \"Collider\"s Christina Radish described Puss as \"charming and unforgettable\", adding that he \"was a cat destined for great things\". Radish said that Puss getting his own movie was no surprise, commenting that the character has a \"tremendous heart\", and is a \"much-loved fighter\". \"Fantasy Magazine\"s Andrew Penn Romine called Puss \"equal parts rogue and hero\", but Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" described the character as \"this vain, spoiled, swashbuckler\". According to Holden, Puss is not \"as clear-cut a personality [in \"Puss in Boots\"] as he was\" in the \"Shrek\" movies. \"IndieLondon\"s Rob Carnevale called him a \"cheeky feline swashbuckler\" and \"Puss in Boots\"s \"enigmatic central character\". Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described Puss as a \"dashing little kitty centerstage\", \"ever-bold\", and \"a self-deprecating, sometimes bumbling but ultimately dashing swordsman\". McCarthy enjoyed Puss's \"vigorous physicality\" in \"Puss in Boots\". Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" called Puss \"endearing\", \"dashing and fearless but also a tad reckless\".

In this model red, green and blue colors are added together to form a new color.\nAn RGB color can be made by shining three colored lights of red, green, and blue onto a white wall in a dark room. Each light has a dimmer (to regulate its intensity.)\nIf only the red light is on, the wall will be red. If only the green light is on, the wall will look green. If the red and green lights are on together, the wall will look yellow. Dim the red light and the wall will become more of a yellow-green.\nEach setting of the three dimmers will produce a different result, either in color or in brightness or both. The set of all possible results is the gamut. Swap the red lamp for one of a different brand that is slightly more orange, and there will be a slightly different gamut, since the set of all colors that can be produced with the three lights will be changed.\nDetails.\nThe name of the model comes from the initials of the three primary colors, red, green, and blue.\nThe purpose of the RGB color model is for capturing, storing, and displaying images in digital electronic devices, such as photo cameras, television sets, video cameras and computers. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.\nThe RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad set of colors. The three light beams are added together, and their light spectra add to make the final color's spectrum. Zero intensity for each component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the \"black\"), and full intensity of each gives a white. \nThis is in stark contrast to physical paints, such as oil paint, which create black when mixed.\nThe additive color model is opposite to the subtractive color model, particularly the CMY color model.\nHistory.\nThe RGB color model is based on the Young\u2013Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and on James Clerk Maxwell's color triangle that elaborated that theory (circa 1860).\nThe first experiments with RGB in early color photography were made in 1861 by Maxwell himself, and involved the process of combining three color-filtered separate picture takes. To reproduce the color photograph, three matching projections over a screen in a dark room were necessary.\nThe modern RGB technology for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in 1938.\nNumeric values.\nA color in the RGB color model is recorded by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. The color is expressed as an RGB triplet (\"r\",\"g\",\"b\"), each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value. If all the components are at zero the result is black; if all are at maximum, the result is the brightest representable white.\nThese ranges may be quantified in several different ways:\nFor example, brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as:"}

{"id": "797364", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797364", "title": "Color model", "text": "A color model is a mathematical model describing the way to represent colors as numbers, usually as three or four values. These values are called color components or color channels. When such model is linked to a description of how to interpret the components (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called \"color space.\"\nAdditive and subtractive color models.\nThe color models can be classified as additive and subtractive.\nIn additive color models, such as RGB, white is the combination of all primary-colored lights, and black is the absence of any light. Other colors are a mix of different strength of primary colors.\nSubtractive color models \"subtract\" or mask colors from white background of the paper. That is the ink reduces the reflected white light. White light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow. Such color models are usually used in printing. An example of such a model is CMYK color model.\nAdditive and subtractive color models are opposite.\nRGB color model.\nMedia that emit light (such as television) use color mixing with primary colors of red, green, and blue, each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors. This is called \"RGB\" color model. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space.\nRYB color model.\nRYB (an abbreviation of red\u2013yellow\u2013blue) is an additive color model that uses red, yellow, and blue pigments as primary colors in art and applied design. The RYB color model underpinned the color curriculum of the Bauhaus.\nCMY and CMYK color models.\nIt is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by putting cyan, magenta, and yellow transparent dyes/inks on a white background. These are the \"subtractive\" primary colors. Often a fourth ink, black, is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the \"CMY\" or \"CMYK\" color model.\nThe cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer.\nCylindrical-coordinate color models.\nA number of color models exist in which colors are fit into conic, cylindrical or spherical shapes, with neutral (gray) colors running from black to white along a central axis, and hues (tints) corresponding to angles around the perimeter. Models of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern models.\nDifferent color theorists have each designed unique color 3D shapes. Many are in the shape of a sphere. The color spheres invented by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.\nHSL and HSV.\nHSL and HSV are both cylindrical, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary color at 0\u00b0, passing through the green primary at 120\u00b0 and the blue primary at 240\u00b0, and then going back to red at 360\u00b0. In each, the central vertical axis comprises the \"neutral\", \"achromatic\", or \"gray\" colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.\nIn an attempt to create an intuitive color mixing model, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August 1978 issue of \"Computer Graphics\". In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model\u2014whose dimensions they labeled \"hue\", \"relative chroma\", and \"intensity\"\u2014and compared it to HSV.\nThese models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then.\nMunsell color system.\nAnother influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century Munsell color model. Albert Munsell began with a spherical model in his 1905 book \"A Color Notation\", but he wished to separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called \"hue\", \"value\", and \"chroma. A\"fter taking careful measurements of human perception, he realized that no symmetrical shape would fit. So he reorganized his system into a blob.\nMunsell's system became extremely popular, the de facto reference for American color standards\u2014used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also electrical wire, beer, and soil color\u2014because it was organized based on human perception measurements. It specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers. The color chips sold in the \"Munsell Book of Color\" covered a wide gamut and remained stable over time (rather than fading). The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only via its measurements: effectively a lookup table.\nNatural Color System.\nThe Swedish Natural Color System (NCS), widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bi-cone. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiar shape based on \"phenomenological\" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same drawbacks as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane."}

Paty was a French secondary school teacher, and he was killed and then beheaded by an Islamist terrorist, Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov. Anzorov killed Paty after a \"hate campaign\" on social media. A student at the school where Paty taught lied about Paty's teaching, and the student's father started the hate campaign.\nPaty showed his students \"Charlie Hebdo\"'s 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech. A girl who was not in the class lied about what the teacher taught, and her father made a complaint to the police. He also started the internet \"hate campaign\" against Paty that caused Anzorov to kill Paty. The murder happened during the trial of other terrorists who were part of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in 2015.\nThe killers in the 2015 shooting were against \"Charlie Hebdo\"'s 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad. After Paty showed these cartoons in a class about freedom of speech, an Islamist imam wrote a \"fatwa\" (\"an opinion on Muslim law\") against Paty which called for his punishment. Anzorov killed Paty and put a picture of his head on Twitter. Many of Paty's students saw the picture. Anzorov said that he had \"executed\" Paty and addressed his words and the picture of Paty's head to Emmanuel Macron, the president of the French Republic. The police shot Anzorov dead a few minutes after the murder.\nPresident Macron said that the event was \"a typical Islamist terrorist attack\", and that \"our compatriot was killed for teaching children freedom of speech\".\nEvents before the murder.\nOn 6 October, Samuel Paty was teaching a lesson on dilemmas. The lesson was about the magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\"'s cartoons of Muhammad and the 2015 \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting. (In January 2015, Islamist terrorists attacked the office of the magazine and killed 12 people.) Paty showed the class of 13- and 14-year-olds the cartoons but said that Muslim students, who might be shocked, could close their eyes or leave the room if they wanted. \nA 13-year-old girl at Paty's school was often truant and failed to go to her lessons. Because of her absences, the school suspended the girl. She did not want her father, Brahim Chnina, to know about her bad behaviour. On 8 October the girl lied to her father that Paty had ordered Muslim students in his lesson on 6 October to leave the room. She said the teacher then showed the other students \"a photograph of the Prophet naked\". She said that Paty sent her home for two days because she disagreed with him. The girl was not in the lesson.\nBrahim Chnina, the girl's father, was 48 years old and was born in Morocco. When his daughter told him her story, Chnina made an angry video which he put on Facebook. In the video, he demanded that the school fire Paty from his job. Chnina made another angry video in which he accused Paty of \"discrimination\". Chnina made complaints to the school and to the police. He said Paty was \"diffusing a pornographic image\". Chnina said that Paty had ordered Muslim students to lift their hands and then leave the room while Paty showed the class the image. Chnina also said there was Islamophobia at the school. He said that other parents should help him force the school to fire Paty. He sent these videos to the organization Collective Against Islamophobia in France () and to his local mosque. Chnina said the same things on radio as well."}

In the 1850s, the term was used for a range of colors or hue, for example by Thomas De Quincey, who wrote \"Porphyry, I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble.\"\nIn color theory, the gamut of a device is the portion of the color space that it can show.\nWhen certain colors cannot be presented within a particular color model, those colors are said to be \"out of gamut\". \nWhile processing a digital image, an image is usually recorded in RGB color model. When printing such image has to be converted from an original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors, which are out of printer's gamut are converted to the in-gamut colors. So, the final image is an approximation of the original one. \nRepresentation of gamuts.\nGamuts are commonly represented as areas in the full visible range of colors. The full range of colors is usually shown as CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram shaped like a horseshoe.\nThe gamut depends on the brightness. So a full gamut is represented in 3D space.\nComparison of gamut of some devices.\nThe list contains some typical devices, wich show pictures, ranging from large to small color gamut:"}

It started being sold for two dollars on August 13, 2013. It is a 2D platform game that involves dodging geometric obstacles (spikes, walls, and creatures) in a series of levels that you can complete. You can also create your own levels in the editor, and play levels made by other people. To finish levels, you have to get through the whole level without dying. You can collect items such as coins, stars, orbs, and diamonds. There are different vehicles in the game.\nGameplay.\nThe player uses the keyboard, touch screen, controller, or mouse (depending on what device they are using) to jump over obstacles in each level. The primary goal of each level is to complete the level without dying. If the character dies you are sent back to the beginning of the level. There are other goals such as collecting currencies such as coins, stars, orbs, or diamonds.\nCurrency in Geometry Dash can range from being easy to hard to collect. Ways to collect currency are by completing quests for diamonds and completing map packs for secret coins and stars. Beating popular levels with all 3 user coins will give you orbs and will unlock user coin achievements.\nIcons are a way of customizing your character. You can get icons by completing quests, achievements, and cracking vaults.\nThere are 3 different vaults in Geometry Dash. The original Vault which requires 10 user coins, The Vault of Secrets which requires 50 diamonds, and the Chamber of Time which requires the Master Emblem. (sold in Scratch's Shop that requires 500 diamonds) Just like the Icon section, you can unlock different icons by secret codes in the vault.\nThe level editor combines different blocks, spikes, and decorations for you to add and create to your very own level. The level editor also allows you to do different things for a level. Background color changing, invisibility, and movement triggers, and different variety of changes to your level creation. Update 2.1 added multiple different things to the level editor. Including dash orbs, the new spider vehicle, and a new orb, a push-down orb that is black.\nOfficial RobTop Levels.\nThe original levels of Geometry Dash are the main official levels created by RobTop. All levels are from songs from official artists, including F-777, DJVI, DJ-Nate, and more. The latest level is from update 2.1, the level Fingerdash. As of the latest update, 2.11, there are 21 levels:\nSpinoffs.\nAs an addition to the actual game, there are 3 spinoffs, Geometry Dash Meltdown, Geometry Dash World, and Geometry Dash SubZero. Each spinoff has a unique set of levels and songs.\nLevel Editor.\nAs originally explained in the original paragraph explaining the main part of the game, the level editor combines different blocks, spikes, and decorations for you to add and create to your very own level. The level editor also allows you to do different things for a level. Background color changing, invisibility, and movement triggers, and different variety of changes to your level creation. Update 2.11 contains different kinds of things to the additional Geometry Dash. Geometry Dash SubZero is currently in update 2.2 and has features of the future of Geometry Dash 2.2's level editor. 2.1 added multiple different things to the level editor. Including dash orbs, the new spider vehicle, and a new orb. A push-down orb. The color of the orb is black. \nAccounts.\nAccounts in Geometry Dash will save all your progress and you can sync it with other devices. If you have more on one device and load a different device's progress, the progress will combine together. Stars, orbs, diamonds, coins, icons, and all vehicles. Every level that you have beaten will add to what you have done with the other device. Saving with more progress that you have will be recommended for you to add on more progress to other devices.\nLeaderboards.\nLeaderboards show who is the best in Geometry Dash. Sadly, leaderboards haven't been updated. There are global leaderboards to show who is best globally, and there are also Creator leaderboards to show who's the best Geometry Dash level creator. There also counts for friends. Also for other leaderboards. \nGauntlets.\nGauntlets are packs of really decorated levels of a certain type of decoration. Such as fire, ice, shadow, poison, custom, demon, death, lava, chaos, time, crystal, magic, spike, monster, doom. Although, one gauntlet is locked. The demon gauntlet is locked and can only be unlocked by the locked up demon guardian. The demon guardian is locked up in the door that's in the Vault of Secrets. In order to unlock him out, you have to beat the Chaos Gauntlet, get to the Chamber of Time, and lock 50 demon chests in the Treasure Room.\nUpdates.\nRobTop has added multiple updates for them to increase fans and get more money and continue making more updates. Starting from 1.7, RobTop made updates more large. The level Electrodynamix was created that update - it introduced the speed boost. From then, more things were added, including new vehicles. Update 2.0 added a new vehicle - the robot. The next update, 2.1, added the spider. Multiple things came at once. 2.11 introduced some extra features. It introduced 5 key chests in the Treasure Room."}

The term is now usually known with United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages.\nAbout 400 to 500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was to transmit secret tactical messages. \nThe code talkers improved the speed of encryption and decryption of communications in front line operations during World War II.\nNative soldiers developed two types of Native American Code Talking (NACT). First developed by Choctaw in World War I, Type one NACT contained coded vocabulary, collections of words or phrases that were assigned to military subjects, within their languages. Type two NACT simply used existing Native languages. Both forms worked as codes because they were based on languages unknown to the enemy and, as the new codes were not based on mathematical processes as found in most code and cipher systems, the enemy had nothing to which to compare them.\nDuring World War II, Comanche soldiers created about 250 coded terms, while Navajo soldiers eventually developed more than 700 terms. Many terms were based on everyday things in the tribal communities such as animals, food, material items and descriptions. Examples of code terms include the Comanche terms for tank (\u201cwakaree\u2019e\u201d or \u201cturtle\u201d) and telephone exchange (\u201cpuhihwi tekwapu kahni\u201d or \u201cmetal talking house\u201d); the Hopi terms for ship (\u201cpa-a-ki-hu\u201d or \u201chouses on water\u201d) and the M-1 rifle (mouth and one); and the Navajo term for grenade (\u201cni-ma-si\u201d or \u201cpotatoes\u201d). A 1941 edition of the journal \u201cThe Masterkey\u201d reports that one of the tribes in the Chippewa and Oneida group developed terms based on the colors of military hat cords and other insignia, with the Native word for \u201cblue\u201d meaning infantry, \u201cyellow\u201d meaning cavalry and \u201cred\u201d for artillery. The Comanche even had a code name for Adolf Hitler\u2014\u201cPo\u2019sa taiboo\u2019\u201d (Crazy White Man). Hopi, Meskwaki and Canadian Cree also had specially devised code terms, although the number is unknown.\nEight Hopi code talkers were in the 81st Division. Although Frank Chapella, Franklin Shupla and Warren Koopyaquaptewa were all from the village of Tewa, they were both Tewa and Hopi and so spoke both of these tribes\u2019 languages. Frank Chapella\u2019s wife, Elidia Chapella, and his son, Marshall Shupla, recall how these three individuals spoke to one another in Tewa (their matrilineal classification through their mothers) and in Hopi with the other five members of their unit.\nSome Type one NACT groups like the Comanche and Navajo also developed alphabet systems, using the first letter of English words translated from Native words to spell out names of individuals and locations. For example, the translation of the Comanche words for pear, ant, rain, ice and snake could be combined to convey \u201cParis.\u201d While the Comanche used an open system by using any word that translated to the desired letter, the Navajo developed a set vocabulary, such as \u201cwol-la-chee\u201d (ant) for the letter a, \u201cshush\u201d (bear) for b, \u201cmoasi\u201d (cat) for c and so on. Later they developed three interchangeable words for each English letter. Both systems prevented repetition and inhibited breaking of the code.\nOne of the benefits of using these codes derived from Native language was open-air messages could be sent faster, often in one to two minutes compared to existing encryption methods requiring up to four hours to craft, communicate and decode. NACT messages were typically brief\u2014usually less than three lines\u2014to avoid creating radio congestion, drawing enemy attention, providing repetition or giving the enemy more transmissions to analyze. \u201cWhenever we sent a message it was short, sweet and to the point,\u201d Comanche code talker Roderick Red Elk noted.\nBecause of the speed of their communications, code talkers were especially important in relaying information and conveying orders that needed immediate implementation or response, such as troop movement, enemy resistance, evacuation of wounded and directing artillery, ammunition and other supplies. \u201cIt was in these defensive positions where you used it quite a bit,\u201d Comanche code talker Forrest Kassanavoid said. \u201cAll critical information, something they felt was really top secret, was in Comanche.\u201d\nDuring 1943 and 1944, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps representatives considered increasing their numbers of American Indian code talkers. However, Army and Navy leaders were skeptical the code talkers\u2019 messages were secure and decided not to expand their units. The Marine Corps expressed optimism but kept silent about its growing program.\nDespite these decisions, several Army and Army Air Forces units each had small groups of Native communicators. In the Pacific, seven Lakota soldiers in the 302nd Reconnaissance Troop became known as \u201cMacArthur\u2019s Boys,\u201d while the 5th Bomb Command in the 5th Army Air Force had a radio net of 15 Native Americans who sent radio communications in Acoma-Laguna, Apache, Crow, Hopi, Lakota and other Native languages. In the Pacific, the Navajo, the largest group of code talkers, served in every major campaign, from the battle on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands from August 1942 to February 1943 to the conflicts on Okinawa, which lasted from April to June 1945."}

It makes sound waves in the air weaker, thereby reducing their amplitude. It is used to reduce or control noise. Acoustic foams are typically softer and more lightweight than their sound blocking foams. The open and flexible cell structure of acoustic foam acts as a natural soundwave absorber and prevents noises from reverberating off hard surfaces like walls, floors and ceilings. It does this by converting existing sound energy to heat and reducing the ability of soundwaves to bounce back into the room. Depending on how it's used, this type of foam can also enhance the acoustics within a room. Sound absorbing foam cut into pyramid or wedge shapes can be used to manipulate vibrations in a way that improves sound quality.\nAcoustic foam can be attached to walls, ceilings, doors, and other places in a room to control noise levels, vibration, and echoes.\nMany acoustic foam products are treated with dyes and/or fire retardants."}

It was written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was published in 1935. It is the third book in Wilder's Little House series. The book and the series are based on Wilder's memories of her family's time in Kansas in the 19th century, but she changed many things so the story would make sense. In the 20th century, it was made into a television series of the same name.\nPlot.\nThe Ingalls family decides to leave the Big Woods of Wisconsin because Mr. Ingalls thinks there are too many people in the Big Woods. He wants to live where wild animals are not afraid to be. He arranges to sell their house. The family puts their things in a covered wagon. They bring their dog, Jack, but they leave the cat, Black Susan, behind.\nThey follow a wagon trail west into the part of Kansas that was called \"Indian territory\" at the time. Mr. Ingalls knows that the land belongs to the American Indians but he thinks the United States federal government is going to change its mind about that. He thinks they will say that white people can settle in Kansas soon. He wants to build a farm before all the good places are taken. He sees a good place near a valley with a river in it, stops the wagon, and starts building a house out of logs from trees from the valley.\nThe book describes traveling west, building a house, daily chores, taking care of farm animals, meeting and interacting with neighbors, catching and getting better from malaria and interacting with American Indians.\nThe Ingalls family spends a year building and improving their house and farm. For example, they dig a well and put glass windows in the house. At the end of the book, the Ingalls family hears out that the government has not changed its mind and that all the white settlers must leave. The Ingalls house is three miles over the boundary into what is at that time American Indian land. The family pack their belongings into the covered wagon again and they leave.\nNon-white characters in the book.\nIn 2018, the Association for Library Service to Children changed the name of its \"Laura Ingalls Wilder Award\" to the \"Children\u2019s Literature Legacy Award\" because people did not like the way Wilder wrote about Native Americans in \"Little House on the Prairie\". They said the book had \"dated cultural attitudes toward Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities.\" For example, in the book, one white character says \"the only good Indian is a dead Indian.\" Some of the words Ingalls use to describe Native Americans makes them sound like non-human animals. Other people disagreed, saying the book showed how complicated things between Native Americans and white settlers were. For example, it shows that the Ingalls family is on Indian land illegally, which means they must leave. It shows Laura asking her parents why they are in Indian territory if they don't want to be near Indians.\nThere is one black character in the book. He is the doctor who cures the family when they catch malaria."}

{"id": "798419", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=798419", "title": "Thalidomide scandal", "text": "Thalodomide is a drug that was developed in the 1950s. It was used as as a sedative, to treat sleeping problems, and anxiety. Its use in pregnant women in 46 countries resulted in the \"biggest man\u2010made medical disaster ever\": more than 10,000 children were born with severe deformities, as well as thousands of miscarriages. A common condition was that hands or feet were directly attached to the body, with all or part of the arm or leg missing. This condition is known as phocomelia. \nThalidomide was introduced in 1956. The German pharmaceutical company Gr\u00fcnenthal marketed it as a medication for anxiety, trouble sleeping, \"tension\", and morning sickness. When it was introduced, it had not been tested on pregnant women. At the start, people thought it was safe in pregnancy. The first concerns regarding birth defects were noted in 1961, and the drug was removed from the market in Europe that year.\nBirth defect crisis.\nThalidomide was developed and first released by the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Gr\u00fcnenthal in 1953. The company had started as a soap maker after World War II to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Chemist Heinrich M\u00fcckter, who was a known Nazi war criminal, was appointed to head the discovery programme based on his experience researching and producing an anti-typhus vaccine for Nazi Germany. \nIt is estimated than more than 10.000 people were affected by their mothers using thalidomide during their pregnancy; about forty percent of the children died at birth or shortly afterwards. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart defects. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey at the FDA. The birth defects of thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries.\nThe severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days' gestation.\nThe total number of victims worldwide is unknown, estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000.\nAftermath of scandal.\nBecause there were many reports of malformations in babies, people were made aware of the side effects of the drug. The drug causes moderate to severe malformations. Most often, limbs are malformed, sometimes they are missing. Some side effects affect the formation of bones, the ear, the heart or other internal organs. The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.\nGr\u00fcnenthal criminal trial.\nIn 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Gr\u00fcnenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. After Gr\u00fcnenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Gr\u00fcnenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500\u201325,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100\u2013450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Gr\u00fcnenthal paid another \u20ac50 million into the foundation in 2008.\nOn 31 August 2012, Gr\u00fcnenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock apologised for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects. Stock was the Chief Executive Officer of Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH from January 2009 to May 28, 2013; he was also a Member of Executive Board until 28 May 2013. At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolise those harmed by thalidomide and apologised for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50\u00a0years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology \"insulting\" and \"too little, too late\", and criticised the company for not compensating victims. They also criticised the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time.\nChange in drug regulations.\nThe disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs. In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market."}

The character first appeared in \"The X-Men\" #1 in November 1963. He has been adapted into motion pictures and is played by James Marsden and Tye Sheridan. \nFictional History.\nOrigin.\nScott Summers is a mutant. He was orphaned as a young boy when his parents died in a plane crash. He survived with his younger brother, Alex Summers. The two brothers were then separated and sent to orphanages. When he was a teenager, Scott was adopted by Charles Xavier, the founder of the X-Men and the headmaster of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (a school for mutants). Under Xavier, Scott learned to control his powers with special glasses, as Scott cannot control them by himself due to an injury he got in the plane crash. Xavier made Scott the first leader of the X-Men, which was made up of four other teenage mutants. \nFamily.\nScott Summers is the son of Christopher Summers, a pilot. He has two brothers, Alex and Gabriel. Scott did not know that he had a second brother for a long time. Scott has multiple children. They are all powerful mutants. His daughter's name is Rachel. She is from an alternate future and can move things with her mind. Scott has a son named Nathan Christopher, and there are multiple versions of him because of time travel. The most well-known version is Cable, a large man with a mechanical arm. The other well-known version is Nate Grey, who is from another alternate timeline.\nRelationships.\nScott Summers has been in many romantic relationships. His most famous is with Jean Grey, a very powerful telepath and telekinetic. Jean is Rachel's mother. Jean and Scott have been married twice. Scott has also been married to a woman named Madelyn Pryor, a clone of Jean Grey. Scott did not know Madelyn was a clone when he married her. Madelyn is Nathan Christopher's mother, but Jean Grey helped raise him after Madelyn's first death. Scott has also been in a relationship with Emma Frost, another powerful mutant.\nScott has several close friends among the X-Men. Wolverine (also known as Logan) is one of Scott's best friends, but they tend to fight a lot over their different beliefs. Storm (also known as Ororo Munroe) is also very close with Scott. She has co-lead the X-Men with him many times. Scott considers many X-Men members to be like his family.\nScott is not friends with many superheroes outside of the X-Men because he is a mutant. The exception to this is the young team of heroes called the Champions, who befriended a teenage version of Scott who got pulled into his future for a short time. The adult version of Scott still sees the Champions as his friends in his present day.\nPowers and Abilities.\nScott Summers has natural superpowers because he is a mutant. His mutant power is to be able to shoot powerful red beams out of his eyes. His beams can knock down large objects, but do not produce heat like a laser. Scott needs special glasses or a visor to control his beams because of a head injury. With his visor, Scott can change the size and power of his beams, from very wide and strong to very focused. Scott is also able to do complicated math in his head to know the angles he needs to bounce his beams just right. Outside of his mutant powers, Scott is a very good tactical leader and is good with children."}

However, research has been done to get an estimate (an educated guess) on how long cats usually live. Cats usually live for 13 to 20 years. Sometimes cats can live for 22 to 30 years but there are claims of cats dying at ages of more than 30 years old.\nThe \"Guinness World Record\" for the oldest cat was for a cat named Creme Puff, who was 38 years old. Female cats seem to live longer than male cats. Neutered cats live longer than cats that have not been neutered. Mixed breed cats also appear to live longer than purebred cats. Researchers have also found that cats that weigh more have shorter lifespans.\nPeople sometimes guess how long a cat will live by comparing it to how long a human usually lives. You can estimate a cat's age in \"cat years\" by multiplying the cat's age in normal years by 7. A better guess for cat years used by veterinarians is: the cat's age times 4, then plus 16. You can use this math for cats who are at least 2 years old.\nThis is an example of both ways of estimating cat years for a 5 year old cat:\nformula_1\nformula_2\nThe life expectancy of an indoor cat is around 17 years, but the life expectancy of outdoor cats is 5.6 years."}

The fruits can vary in shape, some with a straight point at the end and others can be curved at the tip. When ripe, the Egg Fruit looks golden-orange and occasionally exhibits rusty brown blotches, which is normal for this plant. The interior is similar to both the color and texture of a hard-boiled egg yolk, hence the name, and contains 1 to 4 hard black seeds. Ripe egg fruit exudes a strong musky smell. Its flavor is rich with a mellow sweetness.\nSeasons/Availability.\nEgg Fruit is available in fall into summer in tropical climates.\nTerminology.\nEgg Fruit is commonly referred to as Canistel and botanically classified as Pouteria campechiana. It is a member of the Sapotaceae Family and a close relative of the more popular tropical fruit, Sapota. Egg Fruit is also sometimes referred to as yellow sapote. Egg Fruit gets its name from the consistency of its flesh, which when ripe is said to resemble that of a hard-boiled egg yolk, but with the flavors of a roasted sweet potato.\nNutritional Value\nEgg Fruit is rich in vitamin A, B, and C, and also contains iron and calcium.\nApplications\nEgg Fruit is often eaten raw as a simple snack with a sprinkling of salt and lemon juice. It is also used in sweet baking applications as a pumpkin-like ingredient. The pureed flesh may be added into custards, ice creams, bread, pancakes, smoothies, milk shakes or made into jams and marmalades. The egg fruit is a central ingredient in recipes for vegan cheesecake, eggnog, deviled eggs and even cheese. Complimentary flavors include: allspice, cinnamon, ginger, thyme, turmeric, orange, maple syrup, pecans, walnuts, almond, coconut and vanilla.\nGeography/History\nThe Egg Fruit is native to southern North America and northern Central America, including the countries of Mexico, El Salvador, Belize and Guatemala. It has since been naturalized throughout the world in Tropical and Subtropical climates. The trees thrive with moderate precipitation, but can also do well in regions of prolonged dry seasons."}

Many of their goals need money in order to be achieved, and nonprofits are registered with the government in order to be allowed to receive large amounts of money legally. These activist nonprofits usually get money from even bigger nonprofits, which are connected to big businesses and rich people who control industries. But because many activists criticize things in society that businesses and rich people support, they might not get the money if they are too critical. So in order to stay funded, they may have to change the ideas they have for improving society to be more acceptable to industry.\nPeople who believe these kinds of relationships between activists and industries are harmful to activism use the term non-profit industrial complex as a faster way to discuss these relationships, instead of explaining the whole system each time. They have written many articles and books describing the effects of the NPIC by studying patterns of funding or discussing how the goals of some activists changed once their movements began to receive more money."}

Before that happens, it is possible to predict that the following will happen.\nSome types of science can say what could happen far into the future. Before we go further, it is worth noting that our local group of galaxies are bound by gravitation, and its changes and aging can be discussed separate from the rest of the universe.\nFor example, astrophysics can say how planets and stars form, affect each other, and die; particle physics can say how atoms and other matter act over time; evolutionary biology can allow us to see how living things change over time; and plate tectonics can say how continents shift over time. By observing the past and present, astrophysicists, particle physicists, evolutionary biologists and geologists can make guesses about what might happen in the future. \nThe second law of thermodynamics is important to predictions about the future of Earth, of the Solar System, and the future of the expanding universe. The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy is always happening. That means that the universe is slowly running out of the kind of energy that can do work. For example, stars will eventually run out of hydrogen fuel and burn out.\nEarth, the Solar System and the universe.\nErosion is when wind, water or other things make a rock or mountain shrink by breaking of tiny pieces of it off over time.\nSpacecraft and space exploration.\nAs of 2020, five machines that travel through outer space are moving toward the edge of the solar system: \"Voyager 1\", \"Voyager 2\", \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\" and \"New Horizons\". They will travel into interstellar space. So long as they do not crash into anything, these machines should persist indefinitely.\nTechnological projects and time capsules.\nA time capsule is a box or other container that is buried or hidden on purpose and scheduled to be opened many years later. People place things inside the time capsule so people in the future will find them. For example, someone might place a game, tool, toy, journal, magazine or book inside a time capsule so people in the future would see how the people who buried the time capsule lived, played and worked and what they liked to read."}

Sometimes, a professional hairdresser would style the woman's hair. That meant the woman had to be rich enough to pay a hairdresser and to spend hours sitting in a chair not working. This made the high roll a status symbol.\nThe hairstyle could be very tall and make a person's head seem twice as high. First, the woman's hair would be combed. Then the woman or her hairdresser would add pomatum to the hair so it could be shaped. The pomatum would have treated fat, oil and perfumes or spices in it. This would make the hair smell good, kill headlice, and help hold the hair in place. Women would add extra hair collected from cows, horses, or other people. Or they would collect from their own hairbrushes over time and reuse it. Women and hairdressers would use small pillows inside the hair to hold it up. Some women would make curls along the sides or neck with curlers. The hair was held in place with pins. The hair could be natural color or colored gray, brown or white with powder. Some women, for example, Queen Marie Antoinette of France, would wear feathers, jewelry, or sculptures of plants and animals in their high hair. Some women said that it would itch. \nHistory.\nThe earliest high rolls started in the late 1760s and became taller over time. They started in France and moved to London and North America.\nCriticism.\nMany people did not like this hairstyle. English critics complained that English women copied it from France. American critics complained that women copied it from England\u2014and this was in the 1770s, when America was at war with England. Other critics said the feathers in the hairstyles made women look like male soldiers with plumed helmets. American critics also complained that the hairstyle made white women look like African-American men. In the 1770s, African-American men wore their hair in a bunch over their foreheads. Rich men also worried about their wives and daughters spending time with male hairdressers.\nThere are many political cartoons making fun of the high roll and other high hairstyles.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the television show \"Turn\", women in New York and Philadelphia wear and talk about high rolls."}

The attack happened between 8h50 and 9h in the morning local time. The mayor of Nice said, this was a terrorist attack, and called it \"islamist terrorism\". The attacker is an 21 year old Tunisian. The three people who were killed are a seventy-year-old woman, a member of the clergy, and an a woman in her thirties. The woman in her thirties was able to flee, but she died in a restaurant near the church. This attack comes about a week after another one, where a teacher was stabbed, after showing cartoons of Muhammad. Local police who were nearby entered the church and battled with the attacker. The policemen used tasers before shooting at him, inside the church. The attacker was wounded, and has been taken to a nearby hospital. He is a 21-year-old Tunisian man. He entered Italy via Lampedusa in late September 2020. He travelled to Bari, Apulia on 9 October. He arrived in France in mid October 2020. He seems to have been in France without a permit.\nAmong the international reactions was that of Turkey, who wished condolences to the families of those killed. According to the statement: \"There can be no reason to excuse the killing of a human being and justify violence. It is obvious that those who carried out such a brutal attack in a sacred place of worship have never benefited from religious, human and moral values.\"\nOther attacks.\nOn the same day, there was another incident, where an attacker was threatening to shoot people near Avignon, and an attack on the French consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After these attacks, the French state raised its security alert to the maximum level.\nAnalysis.\nMarc Hecker, an expert on terrorism has anylized, this stabbing, as well as another one that happened in September in Paris, as well as the one where a teacher was targeted. He comes to the clonclusion that the attacks are probably related to the republication of Muhammad cartoons by Chartlie Hebdo, which have caused resentent in many Islamic countries. Wassim Nasr is a journalist specialized on Islamic jihadism. Nasr thinks that it is not political jihad which motivates these attackers: \"They are driven by pure fanatism (...) they feel attacked in their beliefs, but they don't have a political project, such as dividing French society, or expelling French troops from the Sahel. Thae fact that they act alone, and that they are not connected to other Jihadists makes observing them almost impossible.\""}

The main purpose was to build a commercial practice. The firm's reputation was made as a result of George Allen's role as adviser to King Edward VIII during the abdication crisis of 1936. By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939, Allen &amp; Overy had firmly established itself as a leading City law firm.\nIn 1996, non-UK clients contributed more to Allen &amp; Overy's revenue than UK clients.

The killer is only known from DNA evidence. This evidence was present at different crime scenes in Austria, France, and Germany. The crimes were committed between 1993 and 2009. Six of the crimes were murders. One of the murders was that of Mich\u00e8le Kieswetter, a police officer. She was killed in Heilbronn on 25 April 2007.\nThe DNA had been found in 40 different crime scenes. There were many types of crimes committed. These ranges from burglaries to killings. In late March 2009, investigators concluded that the \"Phantom\" criminal did not exist. The DNA recovered at the crime scenes had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples. The DNA belonged to a woman who worked at the factory where they were made.\nThe events were fictionalized in different serial episodes. \nInvestigation.\nAn analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the samples collected in Austria showed that it was most often found among people in Eastern Europe and neighboring Russia. This was not discovered in the German investigations. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA done in criminal proceedings is limited. The analysis could only determine a few other personal attributes of a suspect apart from sex. The killer existence was disputed, but is now said to be untrue.\nThe investigations focused on a special task force \"parking lot\" at the Heilbronn police department. In January 2009, the reward for clues regarding the whereabouts of the person was increased to \u20ac300,000.\nThe existence of the \"Phantom\" had been doubted earlier, but in March 2009, the case took a new turn. Investigators discovered the DNA profile on the burned body of a male asylum-seeker in France. This was an anomaly, since the profile was of a female. They subsequently came to the conclusion that the mysterious criminal did not exist. They found that the laboratory results were the due to the cotton buds used for DNA collection being contaminated. Although sterile, the swabs are not certified for human DNA collection.\nThe cotton swabs used by many state police departments were found to have been contaminated before shipping. It was found that the contaminated swabs all came from the same factory, which employs several Eastern European women who fit the type the DNA was assumed to match. Bavaria, although a region central to the crimes, obtained their swabs from a different factory. They had no reports of crimes committed by the Phantom.\nAssociated crimes.\nThe DNA attributed to the \"Phantom\" was found at the scene, as well as purportedly at the sites of the following crimes:\nConclusion.\nAs a consequence of this severe case of contamination with human DNA in a series of forensic investigations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the standard ISO 18385 in 2016. ISO 18385 defines the requirements for producing consumables free of human DNA contamination for collecting biological evidence at crime scenes. The requirement reads: \"Minimizing the risk of human DNA contamination in products used to collect, store and analyse biological material for forensic purposes\"."}

Racism is a system that exists around the world, but because every country is different, the system may work differently in different places. Some parts of racism in Thailand are taken from other countries, but other parts are unique.\nHistory.\nMuch of Southeast Asia has a long history of assuming people with darker skin have dark skin because they work outdoors farming and are poor. These assumptions are often wrong, but they are used to justify treating light-skinned people better and dark-skinned people worse. As a result, many people in Thailand have tried to make their skin whiter. Today, major companies like Unilever make a lot of money in Thailand selling products that make skin whiter.\nThailand also has a history of slavery. The Maniq (or Mani) people of Thailand are an indigenous people with dark skin who have been enslaved by monarchs from Malaysia and Thailand. People often refer to them using offensive slurs that mean \"slave\" in a practice similar to slavery in the United States.\nModern racism.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement caused people to share experiences with racism around the world. One student wrote an article in a major newspaper saying that Thai people who believe there is no racism there are wrong. Another newspaper interviewed a priest who came to Thailand from the United States and was treated badly; the police assumed he was a drug dealer from Africa. Assumptions that black people are from Africa, are violent, and are very involved with drugs has been spread around the world by white people from places like the United States and Europe.\nOne Thai vlogger, Natthawadee 'Suzie' Waikalo, has frequently discussed how racism impacted her growing up. In September 2020, a model in Thailand was called African and many racial slurs after she won a beauty pageant, because some people did not think her skin was light enough and she supported protests that are happening in the country."}

The Mediterranean diet is not only food. It is also the skills and traditions people use to make it, for example farming, fishing, and cooking. It is also the traditions and culture about food and meals.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, people far from the Mediterranean Sea began to eat a Mediterranean diet to become healthier. In 2019, \"U.S. News and World Report\" named the Mediterranean diet \"Best Overall Diet.\" \nHistory.\nA scientist named Ancel Keys started studying the Mediterranean diet in the 1950s. He saw that people in poor Italian villages were healthier than people in New York.\nIn 2013, the United Nations declared the Mediterranean diet intangible cultural heritage from Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Italy, Morocco and Portugal.\nFoods.\nThe diet is based on what peasants, people who worked on farms, in countries around the Mediterranean Sea would eat during the Middle Ages and later, for example, Italian farm workers. They ate a lot of olive oil, beans, and whichever fresh vegetables were growing at that time of year. Meat was expensive, so it was not the main part of the meal. The Mediterranean diet does have foods from North and South America, for example tomatoes.\nHealth effects.\nScientists saw that people who ate a Mediterranean diet had less anxiety and depression. People with type 1 diabetes who ate Mediterranean diet had healthier lives and were less likely to get Crohn's disease.\nCriticism.\nProfessional diet scientists and experts say that the Mediterranean diet can be expensive. A tomato does not cost much money to someone who lives next to a tomato farm and is buying it when it is ripe. It costs more when it is put on an airplane and flown to the middle of a North American city and stored until winter. Other studies show that a Mediterranean diet is not much more expensive than a North American diet.\nMany people think they are eating a Mediterranean diet when they eat pizza, pasta or other foods that are not part of the Mediterranean diet."}

The reform effectively abolished serfdom throughout the Russian Empire.\nThe 1861 Emancipation Manifesto proclaimed the emancipation of the serfs on private estates and of the domestic (household) serfs. By this edict more than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords. Household serfs were the least affected: they gained only their freedom and no land.\nIn Georgia the emancipation took place later, in 1864, and on much better terms for the nobles than in Russia. The serfs were emancipated in 1861, after a speech given by Tsar Alexander II on 30 March 1856. State owned serfs, i.e., those living on Imperial lands, were emancipated later, in 1866."}

In one of his poems, there is a line that makes reference to the four colors. The line talks about white representing the acts of people, the black representing their struggles, the green standing for the fields where these struggles are fought on, while the red is for swords.\nThe very first time these colors were used together was back in 1916 when the flag of the Arab Revolt was designed. The flag was a simple design involving three stripes of black, green, and white from the top respectively. The red color is in the shape of a triangle originating from the left side. Presently, there are several flags that utilize these colors. These flags include those of nations and regions such as Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The brief union that was known as the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan also had a flag that used the colors.\nThe Arab Liberation Colors.\nThe Pan-Arab colors continued to be used for a while until the onset of the 1950s. From there onward, the Arab Liberation colors started becoming more popular and eventually replaced the Pan-Arab ones. The new colors were almost the same as the old ones with a slight difference. In the new scheme, the flag featured three bands of white, black, and red. The green was not eliminated but it was given much less prominence compared to previous designs. Under the new flag, the colors adopted a different meaning altogether. The black now stood for past foreign oppressors, the red symbolized the bloody sacrifices made, and the white was representative of a bright future full of hope.\nThe inspiration for these new colors can be traced back to the Arab Liberation flag that was in use during the 1952 Egyptian Revolution (also called the July 23 revolution). The revolution was led by two army officers, namely Gamal Abdel Nasser and Mohammed Naguib, who wanted to do away with the reign of King Farouk. The new colors appear today in several flags. These flags include those of Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen. Even before Yemen merged, the rival states that made up the larger Yemen, North and South Yemen, both had the colors in their respective flags. There were also Arab unions that did not last very long but had the Arab Liberation colors. These unions were the Federation of Arab Republics and the United Arab Republic."}

{"id": "800049", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=800049", "title": "Hurricane Eta", "text": "Hurricane Eta was a Category\u00a04 hurricane that caused a lot of damage for parts of Central America in early November\u00a02020. Eta originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a031. The system organized very quickly as it moved west, and the cyclone peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on November\u00a03. Some weakening took place as the system made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, late that same day. Eta quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it slowly moved across Central America before moving north into the Caribbean, also quickly moved toward Cuba on November\u00a07. Over the next five days, the system moved very oddly, moving through the Florida Keys, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane strength for a short time, it weakened once more and quickly moved across the Southeastern United States on November\u00a012. It dissipated the next day.\nHurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings happened along the coast of Honduras and Northeastern Nicaragua as Eta approached. More than 10,000\u00a0people went to shelters in Puerto Cabezas and nearby villages. Eta knocked down power lines and trees while damaging roofs and causing flooding in Puerto Cabezas. At least 178\u00a0deaths across Central America have been related to the storm. Once the system began to reorganize in the Caribbean, tropical storm watches were in effect on November\u00a05, in the Cayman Islands. In Cuba, the Bahamas, and South Florida, more areas were under watches. Eta brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Southern Florida had evacuations because of Eta and other floods. Eta's second landfall brought storm surge and gusty winds to the west coast of Central Florida and much needed rainfall to northern Florida. A cold front further to the north worsened this, bringing heavy rainfall and flash flooding to the Carolinas and Virginia, killing another five people in these states. 11\u00a0deaths were related to the storm in the U.S. Nearly $8 billion in damages have been reported across all affected areas by Eta as of December 2020.\nRelief efforts for those affected by the storm were set up in several countries. About 2.5\u00a0million were affected by the storm, including 1.7\u00a0million in Honduras. Many Emergency Response Units were to help support affected people. About 100\u00a0tons of food and water were given to Nicaragua and Honduras from Panama. People left homeless were moved to many shelters after the storm had passed. Donations worth millions of USD had been given to affected countries to help recoveries. However, just two weeks later, all efforts were reversed by Hurricane Iota.\nStorm history.\nOn October\u00a028, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started watching the Southwestern Caribbean. There was an area that might have become a tropical cyclone. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029, the area of interest turned to two tropical waves coming together moving into the Eastern Caribbean, still supposed to enter the region. The disturbance steadily moved westward into a better environment for development. This allowed it to become better organized on October\u00a031, but there was some question as to if it had formed a good circulation. But on 21:00\u00a0UTC that day, satellite and microwave imagery said that a circulation had formed, and the NHC began issuing advisories on \"Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine\". At 03:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a01, the system intensified into \"Tropical Storm Eta\", becoming the earliest 28th\u00a0non-extratropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005.\nContinuing west because of a ridge, Eta slowly organized throughout the day as cold convection began to form on top of its center. After holding onto tropical storm strength for 15\u00a0hours, Eta began to intensify very quickly, becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane eightteen hours later, with lots of lightning being observed in its eyewall. Eta begun to slow down and turn west-southwestward because of a ridge over the United States. At 03:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a03, a airplane found the system still intensifying with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 927\u00a0mbar as it slowed. According to the NHC, Eta maintained its peak winds as it reached its lowest pressure of 923\u00a0mbar at 06:00\u00a0UTC, marking its peak intensity as a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane. \"The Washington Post\" said that several experts thought Eta peaked as a Category\u00a05 hurricane based on satellite imagery as well as a lack of aircraft due to several issues. Still in a in a good location, Eta began to weaken six hours after its peak because of an eyewall replacement cycle, which it completed as it made landfall at 21:00\u00a0UTC south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 940\u00a0mbar. Land caused Eta to weaken very quickly as it moved slowly west after landfall with its eye disappearing and its convection weakening. Only 27 hours after Eta made landfall, Eta had weakened to a tropical depression5.\nEven though the storm was messy, Eta still held on to tropical cyclone status, and began turning northeastward, eventually moving back over the Caribbean Sea on November\u00a06 and speeding up due to the influence of a developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico. On November\u00a07, following a couple of center reformations, the system became better organized and became a tropical storm again, at 15:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a07. Even with strong wind shear, the storm continued to strengthen through the day and reached a second peak of winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 991\u00a0mbar at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08. It then held its strength and slowed slightly before making landfall on the south central coast of Cuba at 09:00\u00a0UTC. Eta weakened after making landfall in Cuba's Sancti Sp\u00edritus Province, but this was short as it quickly moved back over water in the Atlantic Ocean and began to strengthen again as it turned northwestward around the northeastern side of a low that had formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Isle of Youth.\nEta briefly gained a eye feature before bad conditions removed most of its convection, although the storm was able to maintain its intensity as it grew in size and approached South Florida. At 04:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a09, Eta made its third landfall on the Lower Matecumbe Key in the Florida Keys with the same intensity as its Cuban landfall. It then passed just south of the southwestern coast of Florida as it turned westward. Eta then turned southwestward under the influence of a strong ridge across the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and near the US East Coast. This also brought it into an area of really dry air, causing the storm to weaken and its area of gale-force winds to shrink. However, even after its center became sheared to the west of its convection, Eta began to intensify again over the warm waters of the Gulf. Eta than began to speed up north-northeast around the western edge of a subtropical ridge as its center reformed under the convection and an eye formed. Eta then regained minimal hurricane status at 12:35\u00a0UTC on November\u00a011, reaching a fourth peak intensity with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 983\u00a0mbar.\nShortly after its peak, dry air rapidly removed the convection and caused the eye to be gone, causing Eta to weaken back into a tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC. The system turned further east and made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida at 09:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a012, with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened over land as it sped toward the north-northeastward, eventually emerging over the waters of the Atlantic near the Florida\u2013Georgia border at 18:00\u00a0UTC. Eta came out with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) before restrengthening as it began its extratropical transition. The storm completed its transition on November\u00a013. On the next day, Eta was absorbed into another frontal system to the north.\nReadying.\nEarly on November\u00a01, important people in Honduras and Nicaragua put in Hurricane Watches and Warnings for the northeastern coast of Honduras from Punta Patuca to Nicaragua and the northeastern coast of Nicaragua from the Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas. Later that day, a hurricane warning was put in from the Honduras\u2013Nicaragua border (place where Honduras and Nicaragua meet) to Sandy Bay Sirpi, while a tropical storm warning was put in for areas from Punta Patuca to the Honduras\u2013Nicaragua border. A tropical storm watch was also issued from west of Punta Patuca westward to Punta Castilla late that same day.\nCentral America.\nNicaragua.\nSome people were worried that of storm surge along the coastline may happen, so Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega issued a yellow alert for most of the western departments on October\u00a031, which were upgraded to a red alert by November\u00a02. People in coastal towns were told to leave as supplies, including 88\u00a0tons of food, sleeping bags, hygiene kits, and plastic, were brought to Puerto Cabezas according to SINAPRED. The navy of Nicaragua helped more than 3,000 families from offshore islands to Puerto Cabezas as people in the city waited in long lines to access cash machines while getting supplies. Just before the storm's arrival, the army of Nicaragua moved red-helmeted troops to Puerto Cabezas to help in search and rescue efforts that would happen because of Eta. More than 10,000 people were at shelters in Puerto Cabezas and surrounding villages to wait out the storm.\nHonduras.\nAlerts were placed for all of Honduras The Honduran Air Force told two planes to send 4,000 pounds of food to La Mosquitia, Gracias a Dios. The National Police of Honduras was told to tell passengers of roadways blocked by a landslide or flooding. More than 20,000 pounds of food were stored at the Offices of Risk Management and National Contingencies in San Pedro Sula, ahead of the storm. Because of Hurricane Eta, in order to limit movements and protect human lives, the Honduran government canceled the Morazanico national holiday.\nEl Salvador.\nThe Civil Protection Directorate of El Salvador evacuated residents in Tecoluca after setting up 1,152\u00a0shelters across the country. The Autonomous Executive Port Commission thought of closing the El Salvador International Airport due to Eta. The Executive Hydroelectric Commission of the Lempa River cleared pipes to make sure flooding doesn\u2019t happen in communities along the river.\nCosta Rica.\nCosta Rica's National Meteorological Institute forecast lots of rainfall because of the outer bands of Eta, mostly along the Pacific coastline. With flooding starting at the night of November\u00a02, the National Emergency Commission (NCE) put up multiple shelters for people leaving. The agency planned to set up three types of shelters due to the COVID-19 pandemic: infected people, people who might be infected, and non-infected persons. Landslides were expected in many areas due to wet soils.\nPanama.\nAlthough not in the path of Eta, the hurricane was expected to cause damage in Panama. Machines alerted to dangerous swells in Caribbean waters, along with wind gusts up to . The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) told residents to stay alert for possible flooding and landslides. MPO road crews were sent to make sure highways remained clear for travel.\nBelize.\nAs flooding was a major threat because of heavy rainfall, a flood warning was issued for all of Belize because of Eta, as the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) urged residents to evacuate.\nCaribbean.\nCayman Islands.\nOnce the Cayman Islands came close to the cone of Tropical Depression Eta on November\u00a05, tropical storm watches were issued for Grand Cayman and all of the other islands. This came after Eta became forecast to become a tropical storm again before brushing by the islands. Government schools were closed in the islands on November\u00a06 due to the threat of Eta. The next day, tropical storm warnings were put into effect for all of the islands.\nCuba.\nOn November\u00a06, the Government of Cuba issued a tropical storm watch for many provinces of the western provinces of Cuba. Later that day, these were upgraded to tropical storm warnings in some provinces.\nThe Bahamas.\nLate on November\u00a06, tropical storm watches were issued for the northwestern Bahamas. The next day, these watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings.\nUnited States.\nFlorida.\nOn November\u00a06, tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys and parts of the coast of the Florida Peninsula. The next day, these were upgraded to tropical storm warnings in the Florida Keys and the southern tip of the peninsula. On November\u00a07, Hurricane Watches and Warnings were issued parallelly for much of the Florida peninsula and both Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches were extended further north. Residents of small homes and other structures in the Florida Keys were told to evacuate ahead of Tropical Storm Eta as a state of emergency was declared in some counties including Monroe and Miami-Dade. Later, Hurricane Warnings were issued for the Florida Keys. All the warnings for Florida were cancelled by November\u00a09, only to have more issued the next day along the western side of the state as Eta changed directions.\nEffects.\nEta's intensity at the beginning of its lifetime followed by its odd path afterwards bought devastating impacts across Central America, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flash flooding causing most of the damage.\nSouth America.\nColombia.\nDespite passing north of the archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Eta still brought some damage to the island. Wind speeds of cut down the trees and damaged houses, and Eta also caused severe flooding on the island. Damage across the archipelago reached COL$3\u00a0billion (US$777,000). Across the archipelago, two people were injured and 141 families were affected. A total of 6 homes were destroyed while another 64 homes and 24 businesses had damage.\nCentral America.\nNicaragua.\nAs Eta neared landfall, its winds downed power lines and trees while causing flooding and damaging roofs in Puerto Cabezas. At the Getsemani School, where 215\u00a0people were waiting out the storm, Eta's strong winds ripped 10\u00a0sheets of metal off the school's roof. No one was injured in the incident. The Wawa River that connects Puerto Cabezas to the rest of Nicaragua had too much water in its banks. Two people in the municipality of Bonanza died after they were buried in a landslide while working in a mine. Eta caused C$6.128\u00a0billion (US$178.4\u00a0million) of damage in Nicaragua.\nHonduras.\nHurricane Eta had life-changing effects on Honduras, largely due to flooding. Flooding caused 559\u00a0residents to get out oftheir homes and two others had to be rescued. At least 457\u00a0homes were damaged by floodwaters, 41\u00a0communities were cut off by washed-out roads, and at least nine bridges were destroyed including one in La Ceiba. In La Ceiba, floodwaters rushed through streets, and the flooding also washed away a structure at a local cemetery. A ferry leaving Roat\u00e1n was rocked by large waves and winds with 300\u00a0passengers onboard while trying to reach the port of La Ceiba. Nobody was injured on the ferry. The Permanent Contingency Commission of Honduras said that 14\u00a0roads and 339\u00a0homes were destroyed. In Olanchito, 12\u00a0people, including two newborns, were trapped. A wall collapsed at a prison in El Progreso letting in waist-deep floodwaters, causing the evacuation of more than 600 inmates. At least 74 people have been killed across Honduras as a result of Eta, mainly due to landslides and drownings. Among the dead were at least four people, including three children, who were killed in the mountains outside the north coast city of Tela due to different landslides. In Santa Barbara, a 2-year-old girl was killed when she and her mother were swept away by floodwaters; the mother survived. Four members of the same family died in the municipality of Gualala due to heavy rains. A 13-year-old girl was killed when mud and rain caused her home to collapse in the village of Carmen. In Sulaco, a 15-year-old boy drowned while trying to cross a river that was full due to rain. A 37-year-old man also drowned in San Manuel, in the western part of the Lempira Department. Total economic losses in Honduras are estimated to be over 125\u00a0billion lempiras (US$5\u00a0billion).\nGuatemala.\nAccording to the country's president, Alejandro Giammattei, at least 60% of the eastern city of Puerto Barrios was flooded with another 48 hours of rain expected. About 100\u00a0homes were damaged by flooding and landslides. A bridge crossing the R\u00edo Grande de Zacapa in Jocot\u00e1n was washed away. At least 53\u00a0people died across Guatemala, while an additional 96 remain missing. An estimated 343,000 people were directly affected by the storm. The village of Queja near San Cristobal Verapaz in the center of the country was very hard-hit, with a landslide burying 150 homes. Over 100\u00a0people were buried from the landslide, and rescuers began searching them on November\u00a09. However, the searching was called off two days later. Infrastructural damage were amounted to be exceed Q3\u00a0billion (US$386\u00a0million).\nEl Salvador.\nHeavy rainfall affected much of El Salvador as Eta passed to the northeast. Rainfall got over a total of with a maximum of in the La Uni\u00f3n Department. A total of 107 communities had power outages. Across the nation, 1,991 people required evacuation because of floods and landslides. Even with a ban on fishing activities, one fisherman drowned off the coast of Playa El Espino in the Usulut\u00e1n Department.\nCosta Rica.\nThe outer bands of Hurricane Eta brought heavy rainfall to portions of Costa Rica. The heaviest rains were mostly along the nation's Pacific coast, especially in Guanacaste Province. Many reports of flooding and landslides happened nationwide, 12\u00a0rivers saw higher levels, making questions of more flooding, and 26\u00a0people had to evacuate in Corredores and Parrita. In southern Costa Rica, a landslide on a house killed two people, a Costa Rican woman and an American man. Damage while the storm was alive in the nation was almost \u20a110\u00a0billion (US$16.5\u00a0million).\nPanama.\nThe National Civil Protection System in Panama, Sinaproc, said that 200\u00a0homes were damaged by rainfall, maybe because of Eta. The highway that connects the province of Chiriqu\u00ed with Bocas del Toro collapsed near Hornito, blocking the passage of vehicles in both directions. Flooding in Panama's Chiriqui province, near the Costa Rica border killed 19 people. Farming-related damage loss was estimated at US$11\u00a0million.\nBelize.\nCommunities along the Macal and Mopan rivers in western Belize experienced bad flooding due to Hurricane Eta. Residents near the sea in San Ignacio had to be evacuated from their homes.\nMexico.\nAt least 27\u00a0people died as heavy rains because of Eta caused streams and rivers to be full. Over 80,000\u00a0people were affected in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco by rains of Hurricane Eta and a cold front. In the Chiapas highlands, more than 2000 homes were destroyed. In San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, many neighborhoods were damaged by the flooding Amarillo and Fog\u00f3tico rivers. An increase of a lot of water at the Pe\u00f1itas Dam made evacuation plans. In Tabasco, more than 10\u00a0rivers overflowed their banks.\nCayman Islands and Cuba.\nEta brushed by the Cayman Islands just as it intensified back into a tropical storm, producing major impacts across the islands with Grand Cayman being hit the hardest. Wave action off the coast caused minor flooding on the coasts. Downed trees and tree branches also resulted. Power outages became common across the islands with tropical-storm force winds causing damage to power lines.\nEta bought heavy rainfall in areas already dealing with overflowing rivers. Coastal zones in Cuba were also flooded and about 25,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate.\nUnited States.\nFlorida.\nThe outer bands of Eta brought tropical storm-force gusts to South Florida beginning on November\u00a07. A peak wind speed of 53\u00a0mph was reported in these outer bands near Dania Beach on November\u00a07. Florida Power &amp; Light reported just over 30,000\u00a0power outages in the Miami metropolitan area, including nearly 16,000 in Miami-Dade County alone. Overall, about 48,500\u00a0businesses and homes lost electricity throughout South Florida. Heavy rainfall also affected the region, with a peak total of in Miramar, while rain gauges in Davie, Hollywood, Pembroke Pines, and Sunrise measured more than of precipitation. Flooding occurred in Broward, northern Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties. One person was taken to the hospital in South Florida after being rescued from flooded roads. In Brickell, recently installed storm water pumps to deal with tidal flooding and storms helped clear the flood water from the rain and high tide event. One of the state's largest COVID-19 testing sites, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was flooded.\nOn November\u00a011, a sailboat became lodged partially underneath the Matlacha Bridge, causing the bridge to be temporarily closed thus cutting off transportation to and from Pine Island. Around the same area two other boats sank due to turbulent surf caused by the storm and a dock at the Bridgewater Inn floated away.

{"id": "800090", "revid": "7887285", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=800090", "title": "National Union Party (United States)", "text": "The National Union Party was the temporary name used by the Republican Party and elements of other parties for the national ticket in the 1864 presidential election that was held during the Civil War. For the most part, state Republican parties did not change their name. The temporary name was used to attract War Democrats and border states, Unconditional Unionists and Unionist Party members who would not vote for the Republican Party. The party nominated incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln and for Vice President Democrat Andrew Johnson, who were elected in an electoral landslide.\nEstablishment.\nThe National Union Party was created just before the general election of November 1864, when the Civil War was still in progress. A faction of anti-Lincoln Radical Republicans believed that Lincoln was incompetent and could not be reelected. A number of Radical Republicans formed a party called the Radical Democracy Party and a few hundred delegates met in Cleveland starting on May 31, 1864, eventually nominating John C. Fr\u00e9mont, who had also been the Republicans' first presidential standard-bearer during the 1856 presidential election.\nBaltimore Convention.\nRepublicans loyal to Lincoln created a new name for their party in convention at Baltimore, Maryland during the first week in June 1864 in order to accommodate the War Democrats who supported the war and wished to separate themselves from the Copperheads. This is the main reason why War Democrat Andrew Johnson was selected to be the vice presidential nominee as then-current Vice President Hannibal Hamlin was not nominated. The National Unionists supporting the Lincoln\u2013Johnson ticket also hoped that the new party would stress the national character of the war.\nThe convention's temporary chairman, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge of Kentucky, explained that he could support Lincoln on this new ticket for the following reason:\nAs a Union party I will follow you to the ends of the earth, and to the gates of death. But as an Abolition party, as a Republican party, as a Whig party, as a Democratic party, as an American [Know-Nothing] party, I will not follow you one foot.The National Union Party adopted the following goals as its platform:[P]ursuit of the war until the Confederacy surrendered unconditionally; a constitutional amendment for the abolition of slavery; aid to disabled Union veterans; continued European neutrality; enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine; encouragement of immigration; and construction of a transcontinental railroad. It also praised the use of black troops and Lincoln's management of the war.1864 National Union Party presidential nominee, Abraham Lincoln\n1864 National Union Party vice presidential nominee, Andrew Johnson\nNews of his nomination at the 1864 National Union Convention elicited Lincoln's famous response on June 9, 1864:I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me, both by the convention and by the National [Union] League. I am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this; yet I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment. The convention and the nation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for the present and the great future, and that part I am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I am not entirely unworthy to be entrusted with the place I have occupied for the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded, in this connection, of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion once that 'it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams.'In August 1864, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that should he lose the election, he would nonetheless defeat the Confederacy by an all-out military effort before turning over the White House:This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.\nChanging mood.\nThe complexion of the war changed as the election approached. Confederate Commander Robert E. Lee's last victory in battle occurred June 3, 1864 at Cold Harbor. Union General Ulysses S. Grant's aggressive tactics trapped Lee in the trenches defending Richmond. Admiral David Farragut successfully shut down Mobile Bay as a Confederate resource in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 3\u201323, 1864. Most decisive of all, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman captured Atlanta on September 1, 1864, convincing even the pessimists that the Confederacy was collapsing.\nFr\u00e9mont withdraws.\nFr\u00e9mont and his fellow Republicans hated their former ally Postmaster General Montgomery Blair. Fr\u00e9mont, aware that his candidacy could result in victory for the Democrats, made a deal to drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Blair's removal from office. On September 22, 1864, Fr\u00e9mont dropped out of the race. On September 23, Lincoln asked for and received Blair's resignation. The National Union ticket went on to win handily in the election of 1864, defeating the Democratic ticket of General George B. McClellan (whom Lincoln had previously relieved of his command) and George H. Pendleton.\nElection.\nThe Republican Party called itself the Union Party in 1864 and gave out this ballot for supporters to vote for Lincoln\nIn the 1864 congressional elections, the party won 42 Senate seats (out of 54 senators seated, not including vacancies due to the secession of Confederate states) and 149 seats (out of 193) in the House of Representatives. These candidates ran under various party names, including National Union, Republican and Unconditional Union, but were part of the overall Republican/National Union effort.\nPost-Lincoln: Andrew Johnson presidency (1865\u201369).\nUpon Lincoln's death in 1865, Andrew Johnson became the only other National Union President.\nAfter the bitter break with the Republicans in Congress over Reconstruction policies, Johnson used federal patronage to build up a party of loyalists, but it proved to be unsuccessful. Johnson's friends sponsored the 1866 National Union Convention in August 1866 in Philadelphia as part of his attempt at maintaining a coalition of supporters. The convention sought to bring together moderate and conservative Republicans and defecting Democrats and forge an unbeatable coalition behind President Johnson and his Reconstruction policy.\nIn the fall of 1866, Johnson embarked upon a speaking tour (known as the \"Swing Around the Circle\") before the 1866 Congressional elections to attempt to garner support for his policies. His swing was heavily ridiculed and proved ineffective as more of his opponents were elected. Republican National Committee chairman Henry Jarvis Raymond (1864\u20131866) lost the regard of the Republicans for his participation in the convention. The National Union movement became little more than the Democratic Party in a new form as Republicans left the movement and returned to the old party fold by the fall.\nUlysses S. Grant/Schuyler Colfax 1868 National Union Republican campaign poster\nThe last congressman to represent the National Union Party ended his affiliation with the party in March 1867. Johnson was impeached by the Republican-led House of Representatives in 1868 and was acquitted in the Senate by one vote. Upon the 1869 expiration of Johnson's only term as President, the National Union Party came to an end. The platform adopted at the 1868 Republican National Convention strongly repudiated President Johnson while the platform adopted by the 1868 Democratic National Convention thanked Johnson. Johnson received dozens of votes on the first ballot of the Democratic convention, but the party ultimately nominated Horatio Seymour. Meanwhile, the mainline Republicans decided at their 1868 national convention to use the term the National Union Republican Convention. The 1868 National Union Republican delegates nominated Ulysses S. Grant for President and his running mate Schuyler Colfax for Vice President. In 1872, all reference to Union had disappeared. Historians regard the initial National Union coalition assembled in 1864 as part of the Republican Party lineage and heritage.\nLater incarnations.\nIn 2014, the National Union Party would be revived, albeit in an unofficial way by Washington State perennial candidate Mike The Mover (born Michael Patrick Shanks). Mike is not a member of the Republicans or any other political party. Despite this, during the 2014 congressional election for Washington's 1st congressional district, he ran as a candidate for the National Union Party, taking advantage of an election law in the state where candidates can declare themselves a member of any party, even if that party doesn't exist. Mike is a fan of Civil War history and this interest probably influenced his choice"}

It belongs to the family Geoemydidae. It is a semi-aquatic species. This species of turtle has a wide yellow stripe starting from behind the eye and down the neck. \nDistribution.\nThe yellow pond turtle is found in East Asia. The places it can be found includes central Vietnam, coastal provinces of south and central China. There are some other populations of the turtle that are separate from the rest of the species. These can be found in Taiwan, Hainan, Ryukyu Islands, and Japan. The Japanese populations are thought to come from Taiwan.\nThis species lives in ponds, creeks, swamps and marshes. It can be found in shallow, slow moving water. It is omnivorous. The main food for the turtle are insects, fish, tadpoles, leaves and seeds. The yellow pond turtle generally remains in or close to water during the day. It is usually more active at night. It usually goes onto land when it rains.\nSubspecies and Hybrids.\n\"Mauremys mutica kami\" is one of the subspecies. It is currently found in the Ryukyu Islands. There are several hybrid Asian pond turtles species. They were first described as new species but later found out as hybrid species. Fujian pond turtles (\"Mauremys iversoni\") are hybrid species mainly produced in Chinese turtle farms. They are produced when female yellow pond turtles and male golden coin turtles (\"Cuora trifasciata\") mates.\n\"Clemmys guangxiensis\" is a hybrid species that came from the mating of \"Mauremys mutica\" and the Fujian pond turtle.\nConservation.\nThe yellow pond turtle is threatened with extinction. The population in China eats the most amount of turtles in the world. This trading of turtles is the greatest threat to Asian turtles including \"M. mutica\". The turtles are also used in traditional Chinese medicine. There are also turtles kept as pets but are later killed or abandoned. Water pollution can also cause some habitats of the turtle be to gone. The IUCN considers\" M. mutica \"an endangered species. It is listed in CITES Appendix II."}

In games of cricket with time limits, there can be a \"draw\" result, which means no team wins if not enough innings are completed on time (the follow-on is one way that teams try to stop this from happening). When a game of cricket is played with multiple innings per team, the winning team can sometimes win while batting fewer times than its opponent; how many fewer times they batted is sometimes shown in their score.\nAlthough a team's victory is based only on runs and innings (and sometimes the time limit of the game), team scores can also show, sometimes during different innings, the number of wickets lost by (batters who are out on) a team, as well as the number of balls/deliveries (which can also be shown as overs) batted by the team.

This species of plants is\u00a0 limited in range by their ability to exclusively survive in wetlands and marshes. Thus, clusters of the species are constantly threatened by the ever-changing hydrology of the range they are confined to.\nDistribution.\n\"Trollius laxus\" is a rare, herbaceous perennial only found in a small range of fens or wetland habitats fed by groundwater in northeastern United States. In these calcium rich fens, the \"T. laxus\" can be locally abundant. They can also be found in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. During spring, \"T. laxus\" is one of the first flowers to bloom in the Rocky Mountain. Its distribution is limited by light intensity and hydrology.\nWetlands and marshes have consistent groundwater discharge which means that water levels will typically be high in these areas. This will result in anoxia and ultimately lower the amount of nutrients present. It is thought that the plants evolved to endure these conditions so that they have less competition for sunlight. While \"T. laxus\" prefers these wetter conditions, the plant can also grow in drier conditions if there is enough sunlight present. Increased sunlight will increase the biomass of these plants but, there is a threshold before the plant\u2019s growth will plateau or even decline. The combination of seasonal drying along with very high light intensities can result in the competitive exclusion of \"T. laxus\" . In order for \"T. laxus\" to meet this requirement of light intensity and hydrology, it must sacrifice the size of its range. This is a factor that causes it's distribution to be limited.\nHabitat and Ecology.\n\"Trollius laxus\" is a perennial found predominantly in forested wetlands with cold alkaline groundwater. This plant is one of the first to flower in the spring from mid-April to early May in Connecticut, and the seeds are ripened by mid-June where they are dispersed passively with the help of wind and water.\n\"Trollius laxus\" has few effective pollinators including the sweat bee, the Cuckoo bee, and a fly within the family Tachinidae. Molluscan herbivores such as slugs and snails can cause leaf damage impacting the overall plant community diversity. Slug predation on \"T. Laxus\" affects its seedling survival, as well as competition and predation due to the presence of neighboring plants and herbivores. Removing neighboring plants lowers the predation risk on \"T. Laxus\" and increases its growth and reproductive success.\n\"T. laxus\" may also occur in forested wetlands so it may be well-adapted to growing under closed forest canopies. Field observations have indicated that both light and groundwater levels affect \"T. laxus\" plant and population vigor, and that the distribution of \"T. laxus\" may be limited by competition with other plants. \nMorphology.\n\"Trollius laxus\" is easily identifiable by botanists due to their showy bright yellow flowers which are globular in shape. When flower is absent, other characteristics can be used to identify the plant. This herbaceous flowering plant with a one to two foot stems, thick and fibrous roots, and basal leaves. The plant can include one or more stems, each with a cream or pale yellow flower up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter with 5-7 petaloid Sepals. The actual petals are reduced to staminodes with basal nectar glands. Each leaf of \"Trollius laxus\" consists of five three-lobed leaflets that spread horizontally from the tip of the petiole. Each leaflet has sharp teething margins. The leaves sprout on petioles which grow from the base of the plant.\nFruits and Flowers.\nThis herbaceous plant is one of the first to bloom in the spring. The flowering stalk is usually longer than the leaf stalk. The flowers are terminal, meaning the grow at the tip of the flowering stalk and each stalk has one flower. Each flower has five veiny sepals and in the center of the flower sit numerous stamens and ten to fifteen petals deep yellow or orange in color. Hidden among the petals are five or more separate fruits.\nThe fruit of \"Trollius laxus\" are dry with each follicle containing three to six seeds on average, and are formed in aggregate on the stems. The flowers of \"T. laxus\" range from white to yellow in color with nectar glands at the base, and can grow up to five centimeters in diameter. Both flowering and fruit level are positively correlated with light intensity, possibly due to pollinators being able to travel longer distances after leaving a warmer flower than a colder one."}

The batter can be considered as no longer being safe at home base (which can be thought of as the base that comes \"before\" first base) when he has hit the ball into the fair part of the field. A forceout occurs when a player on the fielding team touches a base while holding the ball and a runner at the previous base was made unsafe in this way; that runner is then out.\nIn other words, a runner is forced to run to the next base, with the risk of being out if an opponent holding the ball touches the next base before them, in only the following two situations:\nIf, during the play, a runner is gotten out, and there are other runners who are not out and currently forced to run, then any of those runners that reached a base that came after the base(s) touched by the runner that got out is no longer forced to run. This is called \"removing the force\"."}

{"id": "800414", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=800414", "title": "Arkzin", "text": "Arkzin (also written as @\u00aekz!n) is a magazine. It was started by a group of anti-war people in Zagreb, Croatia in September of 1991. It was an important new publishing house Croatia in the 1990s. \"Arkzin\" has been a paper magazine, a newspaper, website, and a publishing house for books and music on CDs. \"Arkzin\" told people to promote political change using the media. \"Arzkin\" was inspired by the concept of tactical media. The last issue of the magazine was published in 1999. \"Arkzin\" changed media and culture in Croatia and other countries.\nHistory.\nFirst phase: fanzine.\nThe pilot issue was published on September 25, 1991 as fanzine of the Anti-war Campaign Croatia. The aim of the fanzine was to collect information about peace and anti-war initiatives in (post)Yugoslavia, advocate nonviolence and a peaceful solution for the emerging war, report on human rights abuses, support conscientious objectors and serve as an alternative political media platform. As Vesna Jankovi\u0107 wrote in the editorial of the pilot issue: The quality of the Anti-war campaign lies in the multitude and diversity of initiatives that make it up. Arkzin will nurture this diversity and thus be an active contribution to the emergence of civil society, a society of peace, pluralism, tolerance and diversity. Contributors were mostly members of the anti-war groups. The first edition had six issues (double issues: 2-3 and 5-6), with the last issue appearing on May 7th 1992. Circulation grew from 500 to 2,000 copies in A4 format. \"Arkzin\" was distributed through post mail, from hand to hand etc. Publishing costs were covered by donations collected by European peace groups.\nSecond phase: newspaper.\nThe second edition of \"Arkzin\" ran for 93 issues, the first of which appeared on April 1st 1992. Initially a monthly, starting from the issue 13, \"Arkzin\" became a bi-weekly. In\u00a0the second phase, \"Arkzin\" changed its format to A3, broadened the editorial board and scope of topics, included professional journalists as contributors (many of them could not publish in mainstream newspapers any more because of tightening censorship efforts by the state at the time). It was printed in newspaper rotation and distributed through a national newspaper stands network. Circulation grew from 2.000 to 10.000 copies. During this period \"Arkzin\" gradually changed to a hybrid magazine in which politics, culture, theory and art met and inspired one another. Throughout its life as a newspaper, \"Arkzin\" changed its conceptual self-definition, changing from the \u201cMagazine of the Anti-War Campaign Croatia\u201d (no. 10, February 1994), \u201cMegazine of the Anti-War Campaign Croatia\u201d (no. 12, April 1994) , \u201cMetazine for Civil Society Politics and Culture\u201d (no. 66, 7 June 1996), \u201cMemezine for Civil Society Politics and Culture\u201d (no. 73, 13 September 1996). Starting with the issue no. 82 (January 17, 1997) the cover page masthead no longer said \u2018Arkzin\u2019 in the Roman alphabet, but rather in Japanese katakana. In words of Dejan Kr\u0161i\u0107, graphic designer and one of the editors of \"Arkzin\": \"This development reflects the role that Arkzin plays in the context of the movement for peace, non-violence, human rights, women\u2019s power and ecology on one side, and the efforts of a growing range of people to build a cultural environment, which resists not only the war and its consequences but also the strangling grip of the dominant nationalist forces in Croatia, on the other side. Arkzin has established itself as a major forum of independent, alternative, critical information and debate. Arkzin not only criticises the government policies (e. g. the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the evictions of the people from former Yugoslav army housing flats), but also examines the role of the media, of the intellectuals and of various marginalised youth subcultures.\" (note published on Bibliofil) \nThird phase: magazine.\nThe third, and final, phase of \"Arkzin\" lasted from 1997 until 1998. During this period seven issues in total were published. The format, number of pages and printing technique were changed, along with the content. The most professional journalist left the magazine at the time. Articles published were more theoretical, reflective, focused on broader analysis, avoiding everyday political issues. Some critics (see Veljak, Lino \"Civil Society and Politics in Croatia\") believe that in this period, \"Arkzin\" lost its political edge and became a theoretical-artistic experiment.\nOrganizational structure.\nAlthough it had appointed editors-in-chief at various times, in practice \"Arkzin\" functioned as an editorial collective. Each issue was planned jointly at editorial meetings, which consisted of a core of permanent contributors. As Bojan Bili\u0107 writes in the text Islands of Print Media Resistance: ARKzin and Republika:Moreover, although Vesna Jankovi\u0107 was the longest serving editor-in-chief, the publication did not have editorial staff in the classical sense of the term. Those who gathered around ARKzin were more interested in devising inclusive and non-hierarchical editorial strategies. Different people wrote and oversaw editorials at different points in time. \u00a0In addition, collective authorship was experimented with in Arkzin: numerous texts, especially programmatic ones, were co-written by two or three authors. The most famous was a series of 30 editorials entitled \"Was ist Arkzin\" published in 1996-1997 and signed as the Bastard Intellectual Cooperative.\nGraphic design.\nArkzin was known not just for its radical political content, but also for its radical graphic design created by Dejan Kr\u0161i\u0107 and Dejan Dragosavac Ruta. In his analysis of Dejan Dragosavac Ruta's graphic design of different magazines An Anatomy of Ruta's Magazines and Journals, Maroje Mrdulja\u0161 wrote: \"Arkzin's radical deconstructivist aesthetics and the magazine's strongly emphasized \"visuality\" are based on typography research and the deposition of graphic and content layers, and the original approach the authors continually developed stemmed from experience, mainstream media and popular culture, and more \"esoteric\" sources: Neville Brody, via David Carson, to Emigre. /.../ Typographic interpretations and the creation of unexpected connections between different contents, working with information structures of \"timelines\" indicate a research approach to the structure of the magazine as a whole and the text, questioning the very act of reading.\"\nArkzin\u2019s distinctive design resonated well especially with younger audiences and activists, leading to a number of cultural and media initiatives turning to Arkzin\u2019s designers for help in visually shaping their promotional materials and political messages. The fact that designers often did not charge for their services certainly contributed to this. The above-mentioned interview with Dejan Dragosavac Rutta states the following:\"He designed and graphically edited a number of magazines and journals: \u00a0Arkzin, Nomad, Godine nove, Libra libera, Gordogan, Up&amp;underground, Civilno dru\u0161tvo.hr, Frakcija, etc. His clients are mostly present in the field of culture and civil-society scene: Multimedia Institute, Kontejner \u2013 bureau of contemporary art praxis, Platforma 9.81, Eur\u00f8kaz, SKD Prosvjeta, Oceanmore, British Council, the initiative Pravo na grad, for which he designs catalogues, books, promotional materials, campaigns, etc.\"In parallel with the increased engagement, Arkzin's graphic editors publicly thematized the social responsibility of art and design, reaffirming some of the repressed names of Croatian engaged design, such as Mirko Ili\u0107 and .\nArkzin's graphic design also received international acclaim when the Print magazine, American Bimonthly for Visual Culture and Design named him one of the world's most important magazines from 1936-2001 in Perrin Drumm's article \"Eight Years that Changed Magazine Design History\" (Print magazine, January 2010, New York). Arkzin was included in a passage about the year 1993 and the beginnings of a new digital culture.\nBookpublishing.\nFirst book published by Arkzin was \"Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays\" written by Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107, in 1996. Since then Arkzin has published 38 books. Of these, 13 books were published in Arkzin's own Bibliotheque Bastard, and 15 books were co-published in cooperation with various small independent publishers from Croatia and from Serbia (B92) and Bosnia and Hercegovina (Dani).\nEditorial policy follows the theoretical and political orientation outlined in the newspaper: fierce critique of nationalism and capitalism, in step with promotion of Marxism and psychoanalisys (which was by then completely cast out of the mainstream Croatian intellectual circles). In that line Arkzin has published translations of famous titles written by contemporary leftist/marxist authors like Alain Badiou, Guy Debord, Louis Althusser, Fredric Jameson or Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. In addition to translations, Arkzin publishes Croatian and regional authors known for their critical reflection on the (post) war reality of the former Yugoslav states. Among others, in 1997 the novel Maria Cz\u0119stohowska still shedding tears or Dying in Toronto by Da\u0161a Drndi\u0107, who later became award-winning literary author.\nMusic label.\nIn 1998 Arkzin launched its music label Carnival Tunes \"Independent label for good music - since 1998\". Over a period of three years six music CDs were released under this label. In cooperation with Kekere Akvarium, another Croatian undergound music label, Arkzin released one more music CD in 2000. It was double album by Milan Manojlovi\u0107 \"Man from Katanga/ Blue Bar\".\nInfluence/legacy.\nInspired by the idea of tactical media Arkzin actively supported grassroots media and cultural initiatives by promoting them in the magazine or helping them with graphic design of their promotional materials. Often, members of Arkzin editorial board took active role in lounching some of these initiatives. Here are the most significant:\nMultimedia Institut MI2 / Club Mama\nAutonomous Culture Factory Attack\nCuratorial collective What, How &amp; for Whom/WHW is a curatorial collective based out of Zagreb, Croatia. Its members are curators Ivet Curlin, Ana Devi\u0107, Nata\u0161a Ili\u0107, Sabina Sabolovi\u0107, and the designer and publicist Dejan Kr\u0161i\u0107. As they stated in an interview for X-TRA, contemporary art journal:Especially influential for WHW forming was \"Arkzin\", which started in 1991 as the fanzine of the Antiwar Campaign of Croatia and later became a publishing house. \"Arkzin\" was a major forum (virtually the only one for a couple of years) for independent and alternative critical information and debate. In 1998, when they published a 150th anniversary edition of the \"Communist Manifesto\" by Marx and Engels, edited by Boris Buden with an introduction by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, they approached one of us to organize a contemporary art exhibition that they hoped would trigger a timely public debate on the issues the Manifesto might raise in Croatia. Organizing an exhibition on the \"Communist Manifesto\" immediately seemed to have the potential to intervene in the field of art on all levels, in terms of content, obviously, and in terms of organizational know-how, as well as in terms of assessing and building local and international contexts. The goal of these interventions was to oppose an individualistic understanding of cultural work. (interviewed by Michelle Dizon, X-TRA, Spring 2010, Volume 12 Number 3)."}

An average Golden doodle is 23 to 29\u00a0inches in height. Golden doodles come out with long muzzles, and dark, oval shaped eyes which mostly come out brown, but can rarely be blue or green. Golden doodles have a curly coat. The coat can be golden, cream, white, or even red! A Golden doodle\u2019s coat often lightens with age.\nCare and Maintenance.\nGolden doodles are a high-maintenance breed. They will need to be professionally groomed every 8 to 12 weeks. A Golden doodle needs at least 15 to 30\u00a0minutes of exercise three times a day. When a puppy, they tend to want to play interactive games like fetch, but as they grow older, they enjoy a gentle stroll. Haircuts are necessary for Golden doodles every six weeks. This will keep the fur from tangles or matting. Make sure to take your Golden doodle out every 45-60\u00a0minutes.\nFeeding.\nGolden doodle puppies need to be fed 4 small meals a day. When your puppy grows up to 6 months old, you can feed the golden doodle larger meals twice a day.\nTraining.\nGolden doodles are an energetic breed, so training will be much harder. To sit: Hold a treat up in the air over the Golden\u2019s head until it sits. Reward the dog with the treat. To lay down: While the dog is sitting, hold a treat in your hand and wave your free hand up and down while beckoning the dog to lay down. Reward the Golden with the treat when it lays down.\nFinances.\nGolden doodles usually cost around $500 to $4000 depending on where you pick up the pup. Basic dry kibble costs $100-$250 per year. Premium dog kibble will cost around $200-$400 per year. For maintenance, smaller golden doodles cost less than bigger golden doodles. For grooming, you will pay around $50 to $80 every 8 weeks.\nBreed.\nGolden doodles live around 10-15 years. This life span is inherited from the poodle and golden retriever parents. Many Golden doodles die from a heart disease called sub valvular aortic stenosis, which can be avoided by working out your dog with cardiac exercises. Golden doodles were first bred in the United States. Golden doodles were at first meant to be guide dogs, but they gained popularity and became pets."}
