It was not given a large theatrical release. Because of that,\"Gummo\" failed to bring in much money. Reviews on the movie from the critics were mixed.\nPlot.\nA young boy named Solomon narrates events from the tornado that went through the small town of Xenia, Ohio. A mute adolescent boy, nicknamed Bunny Boy, wears only tennis shoes, shorts and pink bunny ears on an overpass in the rain.\nA boy named Tummler, who is also a friend for Solomon, carries a cat by its neck. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. \"Gummo\" then cuts into a different scene with Tummler in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle one another. Tummler realizes there is a lump on one of the girl's breast's. Tummler and Solomon then ride down on a hill on bicycles.\nLater, Tummler points an air rifle at another cat. Solomon stops him from killing the cat and says it was a housecat. The boys leave. The camera then follows the cat to its owners' house.

It means that every person that is able and willing to work can get a job. It does not mean that all people have a job: People who do not have the skills the employers want may still not have a job, because there simply is no role that fits them. This is called \"structural unemployment\". Also, it is very likely that there will be people looking for jobs (called \"frictional unemployment\").\nIn general, people say there is full employment, if the percentage of people who are able and willing to work, but who do not have a job is below a given rate. In 1945, William Henry Beveridge said there was full employment if there are more jobs than job seekers. He said that an unemployment rate of three percent of frictional (short term) unemployment can be considered full employment. "}

On 22 January 2018, the Duke of York's office at Buckingham Palace announced their engagement. In April 2018, the couple moved from their residence at St James's Palace to Ivy Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace. Their wedding took place on 12 October 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Contrary to press speculation that Brooksbank would be created \"Earl of Northallerton\", he has not been elevated to the peerage after marrying into the royal family, following a trend in recent years for a male commoner not to be awarded one upon marriage to a princess.\nThe couple's son, August Philip Hawke Brooksbank, was born on 9 February 2012 at the Portland Hospital in London. At his birth, he was eleventh in line to the throne."}

It is about a game preserve in South Africa called Thula Thula where a herd of elephants come to live.\nPlot.\nLawrence Anthony tells the reader about elephants who came to live at Thula Thula in 1999. They had been at a different game preserve, but they learned how to break through the electric fence and escape. This was bad because they ate people's crops and because any human who wanted to could kill them. The oldest elephant was shot by humans.\nUsually, African game wardens did not talk to or go near the elephants because this can change their natural behavior. But these elephants were so angry at and afraid of humans that Anthony decided to do something different. He decided to make friends with them so they would not hate humans. In the book, he tells the reader how he became friends with the elephants, caught poachers, made deals with African humans who lived nearby, for example the Zulu king and chiefs, took care of a sick baby elephant, and ran the game preserve.\nCritical response.\nThe audiobook recording of \"The Elephant Whisperer\" won an Audie Award for best biography or memoir."}

He is noted for his \"natural charisma of the great frontmen\", and as an Italian fashion icon.\nBiography.\nDamiano was born in Rome, Italy, to flight attendant parents. Due to the nature of his parents' work, he and his brother travelled worldwide from an early age and were introduced to various cultures. Until he was 17, he showed some talent playing basketball as a point guard at the local club Eurobasket Roma. He recalls that the basketball experience gave him fundamental discipline to succeed in his life.\nDamiano started singing when he was only six years old. He met Victoria De Angelis, Thomas Raggi and Ethan Torchio, his future band members from M\u00e5neskin, during high school days. He studied at the liceo linguistico Eugenio Montale in Rome, but he did not complete high school and instead devoted himself to his music career, for which he also had the support of his parents. When introduced for the position of a vocalist for their local band, he was initially rejected because his style was considered \"too pop\", but his insistence to be in the band eventually got him accepted. Damiano soon changed his demeanor and style, especially his stage persona, because he learned how to freely express himself, as well as gaining confidence in his sexuality. The band was formed in 2016 and initially played as buskers in the streets of the city of Rome, but in 2017 they soon rose to prominence when they finished second in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show \"X Factor\". The band had a breakthrough debut with the studio album \"Il ballo della vita\" and tour in 2018 and 2019. In 2021, their second studio album \"\" was released.\nAfter their win at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 he was falsely accused of drug use during the final. Damiano and his bandmates have been anti-drug advocates since the beginning. Damiano himself stated in his \"Vogue Italia\" interview, \"we are not falling into the stereotype of the alcoholic and drugged rock star\". He believes that creativity comes from a \"healthy, trained and lucid\" mind and it is contradicting trying to truly express \"our own self by binding ourselves to something that instead makes us dependent, slaves\", also referring to the 27 Club.\nPersonal Life.\nAgainst numerous rumors about Damiano's personal life, in 2021 he announced that he has been dating Giorgia Soleri for almost four years."}

As a teenager, she underwent several surgeries, including surgery to remove a lung tumour. After that she can't sing in the traditional way. \"The sound is not formed in my lungs or bronchi, because there is not much space there, but somewhere here (points to the back of the head). This is especially true of high notes,\" she said.\nDuring her school years she studied at the Nizhyn Music School in the vocal and choral department. She sang in the children's choir \"Shine\". She studied instruments - piano and guitar. According to Pavlenko, teachers guided her to pursue opera singing in the future.\nIn 2009 she graduated from the Nizhyn School of Culture and Arts named after Maria Zankovetska with a degree in folk choir conductor (faculty - folk choir).\nDuring her studies at the school she was a member of several local rock bands: \"Contours of Shadows\", \"My spirit\".\nIn 2009-2013 she studied at the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts at the Faculty of Music (specialization \"Folklore\").\nDuring her student years she directed the ensemble \"Vytynanka\", sang in the ensemble \"Queen\" (KNUKiM).\nShe studied the folklore of the left-bank Kyiv region (Baryshiv district, Berezani suburbs, etc.). She was interested in the folklore of Chornobyl Polissya.\nIn 2012, she joined the band Go_A, six months after its creation. At first, she performed as a backing vocalist, later she became a soloist.\nAs part of the band Go_A released 1 studio album \"Go to the sound\" and several singles.\nSince 2017, Pavlenko has been the leader of the Veterans' Choir in Berezan (Kyiv Region) at the City House of Culture.

According to Kateryna Pavlenko, this is one of the strongest feelings when 30 voices sing under her direction.\nAt the same time she wrote poems and solo songs, which he published under the pseudonym \"Monokate\".\nOn February 22, 2020, together with the band Go_A, she won the National selection for the song contest \"Eurovision-2020\" with the song \"Nightingale\". Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the contest was cancelled, but Go_A represented Ukraine next year at Eurovision-2021 with the song SHUM. In the final of the competition, the band took the 5th place in the sum of points from the national jury and the spectators (according to the results of the spectator voting - the 2nd place, and in the semifinals the team won the 1st place)."}

It is often sung in the conclusion of the Lai Haraoba festival. Its theme is closely associated with the creation myth of the earth itself. It is also regarded as the song of thanksgiving to the Almighty God. It is always sung in the chorus formed by the male singers with the maiba as the precentor and is strongly enjoined that the chains of the singers forming a circle should never be snapped. It is also known for its incantatory power, for with the alteration of a few lines, it is believed to have been able to cause either prosperity or destruction of the kingdom and the people. Many rulers performed by themselves the rites of singing it with an accompanying dance on the occasion of their conquests or coronation. According to the manuscript \"Laisra Pham\", a treatise on administration and social conduct, \"Ougri\" is refered to as sung at the coronation of Nongta Lailen Pakhangpa in 33\u00a0AD. The Naothingkhong Phambal Kaba mentions it as being taught by the sage Luwawg king to the Meitei prince as a part of the Meitei lore, which according to the chronicle Cheitharol Kumbaba, took place just prior to 663\u00a0AD.\nIn some cases, it is also refered to as the actual war songs of the Meitei people.\nNotably, it is regarded as one of the earliest gems in the Meitei literature (Manipuri literature)."}

The first part is the 25th and last episode of the 6th season. The second part is the first episode of the 7th season. Both parts were first broadcast on the Fox network. The first part was broadcast on May 21, 1995 and the second part was broadcast on September 17, 1995. In the first part, oil is found at the Springfield Elementary School. Mr. Burns takes all of the oil and tries to make everyone in Springfield angry. Mr. Burns later gets shot by someone. In the second part, the police in Springfield try to find the person who shot Mr. Burns. They believe the suspects are Mr. Smithers and Homer Simpson. \nBoth of the parts were written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. The first part was directed by Jeffrey Lynch and the second part was directed by Wes Archer. Tito Puente guest starrs in both parts. The idea of the story came from Matt Groening (creator of \"The Simpsons\"). The writers made his idea become an episode with two parts. The first part has many clues for who shot Mr. Burns becaues the writers wanted people to be able to figure it out. The episode's story came from the \"Dallas\" episode \"A House Divided\", where J. R. Ewing gets shot. Before the second part was broadcast, fans debated on who shot Mr. Burns. Fox started a contest about it over the summer of 1995.\nStory.\nFirst part.\nAt the Springfield Elementary School, Groundskeeper Willie makes a hole to put a dead classroom pet in. He finds oil under the school and makes the school rich. Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers ask the students and teachers on how they should use the money. Student Lisa Simpson wants them to hire Tito Puente as a music teacher. \nAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer is sad because his bossboss Mr. Burns keeps forgetting his name. His wife Marge tells him to give Burns a box of chocolates with a picture of the family under it. Burns and his assistant Mr. Smithers eat all of the chocolates except for the one above Homer's face. Burns writes a card that thanks only Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. This makes Homer start feeling angry.\nMr. Burns thinks of a way to take the oil from the school. He makes people build a slant drill. The drill gets all of the oil before the school can get any. The slant drill causes many problems for the people in Springfield. Groundskeeper Willie and Tito Puente must be fired from the school. Moe Szyslak must close down his tavern because of the oil's fumes. The retirement home Grampa Simpson lives at gets destroyed and must live at the Simpson family's house. The slant drill throws oil at Bart's treehouse, which destroys the treehouse and breaks Santa's Little Helper's legs.\nBurns tells Smithers that he has built a machine that will block the sun in Springfield. He hopes this will take away all of the sunlight and will make people buy his electricity. Smithers tells Burns that he is hurting too many people, which makes Burns fire Smithers. Homer gets very angry at Burns for not knowing his name. He quietly goes into Burns' office and writes \"I am Homer Simpson\" on a wall with spray paint. Burns sees him but still does not remember his name. Homer attacks Burns and gets taken away by Burns' security guards.\nThe people in Springfield start a town meeting to talk about what Burns has done to them. Burns goes to the town meeting with a gun to defend himself. He starts the machine that blocks the sun. He walks away into an alley and gets shot. Burns becomes weak and falls on a sundial. Many people in Springfield find him on the sundial. Marge says that since he made many people angry, everyone there is a suspect. Chief Wiggum says that he will get the police to start an investigation.\nSecond part.\nMr. Burns is taken to a hospital. Smithers says that he remembers shooting someone, but does not remember who he shot. Smithers believe he has shot Burns and talks about it at a church, where he gets arrested. When he gets shown on television, Smithers references an episode of a fake show on Comedy Central. Sideshow Mel knows what he is referencing and tells police that Smithers is innocent. He says this because Smithers was watching the episode when Mr. Burns was shot. Smithers said in the town meeting that he always watches the show. He then remembers that he actually shot an elderly man with a leg made out of wood. \nLisa helps the police with the investigation. They talk to other suspects and find that they are innocent. Tito Puente says that he would not shoot Burns, but instead he would perform a mambo song about it. Skinner was putting make-up on when Chalmers finds him doing so. Willie can not shoot with a gun since he has arthritis in his fingers. Moe gets put on a polygraph (lie detector) that says he did not shoot Burns. A dream tells Wiggum to look in the suit Burns was wearing when he was shot. They find DNA on the suit that is from anyone in the Simpson family. Mr. Burns wakes up at the hospital and yells \"Homer Simpson!\" The police raid the Simpsons' house and find a gun under their car's seats. The gun has Homer's fingerprints and the bullets in the gun are the same kind that were used to shoot Mr. Burns. Homer gets arrested and is put in a police van. At a restaurant drive-thru, the police van falls over and lets Homer run out of the van. \nThe doctors at the hospital learn that \"Homer Simpson\" are the only words Burns can say. Lisa investigates where Burns was shot to see if there is anything that shows that Homer did not shoot him. The police learn that Homer is in the hospital that Burns is at. They go to Burns' room and find Homer shaking him. Burns can now speak normally but forgets Homer's name again. Homer gets very angry and points a gun at Burns' head. Burns laughs and says that Homer did not shoot him. He then tells everyone who really shot him: Maggie. \nHe tells the story of how Maggie shot him. After he left the town meeting, he finds Maggie with a lollipop in the Simpsons' car. He tries to take the lollipop, but Maggie will not let him. Burns takes it, but his gun falls out of his suit. The gun falls on Maggie's hands, who accidentally shoots him. Homer later leaves fingerprints on the gun while trying to find something he dropped under the seats. When Burns fell on the sundial, he moved his arms to the \"S\" (south) and \"W\" (west) sides of the sundial. Lisa believes that he saw the \"W\" as an \"M\" and put his arms there to show who shot him. Burns tells Lisa that he did not know he moved his arms in that way. He says that he wants Maggie to be arrested, but Chief Wiggum tells him that she is too young to be arrested.\nProduction.\nMatt Groening got the idea to make an episode where Mr. Burns was shot. He thought this idea could be used to get more people's attention. The writers wanted the episode to be in two parts with a mystery that could be used for a contest. They made it so that the mystery had clues, had hidden images, and that it would be easy to understand who shot Burns. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein (the writers of the episode) got the idea for Barney Gumble to be the one who shot Mr. Burns. David Mirkin wanted Maggie to do it because he thought it would be funnier if someone from the Simpson family did it.\nProducers of \"The Simpsons\" wanted to make sure not many people knew who did it. David Silverman was the only animator who knew it while the episode was being made. Wes Archer (director of the second part) did not know that Maggie shot Mr. Burns. Silver and Archer did not work on the animation of the ending until summer in 1995. They made other animators do smaller work so that they did not know who did it. In the table-read (when the show's staff read the script) of the episode, they did not read the ending. Parts of the animation had to be made again so that it got the clues to the mystery. Oakley and Weinstein were not sure if Maggie should have done it, so they made the ending seem as if Maggie may not have shot Mr. Burns accidentally.\nTito Puente and his Latin jazz ensemble were in the episode. They sing the song \"Se\u00f1or Burns\". Oakley and Weinstein did not know Puente well enough. They let him in the episode because Groening is a fan of Puente. They thought he would sing the song, but they later learned that Puente is a drummer and is not a singer. One person from his ensemble sung the song instead.\nHidden clues.\nMany hidden clues were put in the first part for people who wanted to figure out who shot Mr. Burns.\nDifferent endings.\nDavid Mirkin wrote many \"terrible endings\" because the episode was very popular at the time. Harry Shearer voice acted for the different endings. Mirkin wanted to trick the people working on the episode and wanted to show it to the media. However, this was not able to happen. Many of the different endings were animated to show other characters shooting Mr. Burns. Some of these were shown in the episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\". That episode showed Barney, Tito, Moe, Apu, and Santa's Little Helper shooting him. Another ending was made with Mr. Burns in the hospital to show that Smithers had shot him. In that ending, Lisa says he falls on the \"S\" and \"W\" sides of the sundial because they are the first letters of Smithers' first and last names.\nTheories.\nMany years after the episodes were first broadcast, fans have made theories that other characters may have shot Mr. Burns instead of Maggie. On April 2020, one fan said on Reddit that Homer Simpson made himself look like Krusty the Clown when the people in Springfield first find Burns to be shot. The fan used the episode \"Homie the Clown\" to prove the theory. In that episode, Homer makes himself look like Krusty and makes people think he actually is him. Krusty did not wear a bowtie at the town hall, but he is seen with one near the sundial. Bill Oakley later said that this was not suppose to happen. He also said that animators were told not to put Homer in the ending of the first part.\nContest.\nBefore the second part was broadcast, many fans debated over who shot Mr. Burns. Fox started a contest where people who called the telephone number 1-800-COLLECT would be able to say who they think shot Mr. Burns. This contest lasted from August 13 to September 10. Fox started a website about the episodes. More than 500,000 people went on the website in the summer of 1995. The person who won the contest would get to be animated in an episode. The contest rules said that the winner had to be chosen from a random sample of people, even if none of the people in the sample got it right. The random sample that was chosen did not have any right answers. A winner was picked at random out of that sample, who was Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C. Gibson did not want to be in the show and instead got cash for winning.\nTelevision special.\nA television special named Springfield's Most Wanted was broadcast before the second part on September 17, 1995. It was hosted by John Walsh, who is the host of \"America's Most Wanted\". The special was made to help people figure out who shot Mr. Burns. It shows clues from the first part and talks about suspects of the mystery. Daryl Gates, Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue talk about who they think did it in the special. Jimmy Vaccaro from The Mirage talked about the odds of who shot Mr. Burns. He said that the odds for Homer are big, with odds of 2:1. Maggie did not have good odds with 70:1. Critics did not like the special. They thought it made the episodes look more popular than they really are.\nReception.\nIn 2003, \"Entertainmeny Weekly\" made a list of 25 episodes of \"The Simpsons\" they thought were the best. They put both parts of \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" as 25th on the list and called it \"\"The Simpsons\" most pop moment ever\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Entertainment.ie\" named the episodes one of the 10 greatest \"Simpsons\" episodes ever. When \"The Simpsons\" was put on Disney+, Oakley said that the first part is one of the best episodes to watch there.\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\") thought that the first part was a great way to end the sixth season. They said \"it's a genuine whodunnit. There's no cheating - all the clues are there.\" Jake Rossen from \"Wizard\" put the first part's ending on his list of the best cliffhangers. However, he felt disappointed when it was shown to be Maggie who shot Mr. Burns. He said \"Sometimes it's better to make up your own ending, kids.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" put the first part on their list of best season finales (last episode of a season).\nThe song \"Se\u00f1or Burns\" got a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award in 1996. Alf Clausen is the composer of the song and Oakley and Weinstein (the episode's writers) also wrote the lyrics."}

The nuclear power plant is located at a distance of 2 km from the city of Prypyat, built primarily for its employees.

As of the beginning of 1986, Chernobyl was the most powerful nuclear power plant in the European part of the USSR. On April 26, 1986, during a design test, an accident occurred that completely destroyed the station's fourth reactor and caused significant contamination of the surrounding area with radioactive substances. As a result of this catastrophe, the population of Prypyat, Chornobyl and all other settlements within a radius of 30 km around the station was completely evacuated. Today the accident itself is one of the largest man-made disasters in human history."}

The zaibatsu were also business groups, but they were owned by families. The zaibatsu supported the military government of Japan from the 1800s through World War II, so the Americans broke them up after the war.\nIn the 1990s, there was a financial crisis in East Asia. Most of the companies in keiretsu decided to cut costs. This weakened the keiretsu because each company wanted to get the best deal, even if it wasn't with a company in its own keiretsu.

Erskine was part of the Indian Civil Service, and worked for the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Arthur. Erskine was a scholar and translator, and he worked in the government's Persian department. He worked to improve education, and became the first \"director of public instruction\" in the west of India. He was also a judge and a legislator. He was the third vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta.\nEarly life.\nClaudius James Erskine was born on 20 May 1821 at Bombay in the East India Company's Bombay Presidency. He was the son of William Erskine, a historian and civil servant from Edinburgh who worked in India. Claudius James was the second of William Erskine's sons. His mother was Maitland Mackintosh. She was the second daughter of James Mackintosh.\nErskine went to both the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh. Then he studied at the East India Company College at Haileybury in Hertfordshire.\nCareer.\nHe returned to Bombay in 1840. In 1843, Erskine became the private secretary of Sir George Arthur, the governor of the Bombay Presidency. In 1847, Erskine became deputy secretary in the government's Persian department and a translator. Then he became secretary of the Bombay government's general department and its judicial department.\nIn 1854, Erskine published his father's work on the early Mughal Empire. William Erskine had died in 1852, before he finished the book, so his son Claudius finished the work and published it as \"A History of India under the Two First Sovereigns of the House of Taimur, B\u00e1ber and Hum\u00e1yun\". In 1855, Erskine became director of public instruction. He was the first person in this position in western India. During 1859 he was a judge in the Konkan region. In 1860 he became a member of the new Imperial Legislative Council.\nOn 8 April 1862, Erskine became vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, after William Ritchie. In 1862, Erskine started to be a judge on the Bombay high court. On 26 March 1863, Erskine stopped being vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, and Henry Sumner Maine became vice-chancellor.\nIn 1865, Erskine became a member of the Bombay Legislative Council. In April 1866, Erskine joined the Bombay Geographical Society and became its president.\nIn 1867 Erskine retired. In March 1867 he resigned the presidency of the Bombay Geographical Society and planned to return to Europe.\nDeath.\nErskine had retired for health reasons. He returned to Britain and died near Hyde Park, London, on 6 June 1893.\nFamily.\nIn 1847, Erskine married Emily Georgina Reid, daughter of Lestock Reid. Erksine's new father-in-law was acting as the governor of Bombay at that time.\nCollection.\nErskine had a collection of objects and manuscripts from Asia. Some of these are now in the British Museum and the British Library.\nOne manuscript in the British Library (\"Additional manuscript\" 26319) has five different texts in four languages. The British Museum bought this manuscript from Erskine in February 1865. From 1811 are two Kurdish language glossaries that Muhammad Husain Khan made for John Malcolm at Bushehr, one a Persian\u2013Laki glossary, the other a Persian\u2013Ardalani glossary. Another is a Kurdish\u2013English glossary. From the 19th century is a glossary of words in the Persian language and the Chagatai language, with words from the \"Baburnama\" of Babur. The final work in this manuscript is an anonymous work in Persian with the name in . This work is on the subject of metaphysics and consciousness. The copy of the \"J\u0101m-i Jah\u0101nnam\u0101\u012b\"'s date is 1141 \"anno Hegirae\" (1729 CE). Erskine himself probably bound these five manuscripts into the present manuscript codex.\nIn 1886, when Erskine was living in London, he sold more of his collection. The British Museum bought from Erskine an brass astrolabe with a silver inlay. Erskine's astrolabe was from Iran, and made in the 16th or 17th centuries, during the Safavid Empire. Before Erskine owned the astrolabe, Claudius Rich was its owner. (Rich was a relative of Erskine's because Rich had married Erskine's mother's older sister, Mary Mackintosh.) Rich had got the astrolabe in Yazd. The British Museum paid Erskine \u00a318 for it. The museum also bought other things from Erskine that year. Erskine had got from Rich a sword and sheath from the Ottoman Empire that were from the 16th or 17th centuries. The British Museum bought these in 1886. The next year, the British Museum bought more of Erskine's objects."}

Literacy was the first starting-point. Before about 1470 all books were hand-written. Printing made the word visible. Before 1800 most ordinary people could not read or write. That was true for all countries. By 1900 most people in the most industrial countries could read. The Bible was one of the causes: people wanted to read the Bible in Christian countries. Just as important was industrialization. With industry grew a need for instruction, and there were printed rule books in key industries such as the railways. Church registers in England show increasing literacy as judged by the ability of men to sign their names. Previously, if a man signed with an X, a church clerk added his name.\nAn enormous amount of research has been done in the United States, and very much less elsewhere\nResearching comes in many ways. Researches here focuses more on how people gather new things into their minds. These people could be learners or teachers. Both can interact in spaces of learning. These spaces are also known as classrooms. So researchers collect data inside classrooms, more or less. \nEducational researchers believe that the way they do research must be careful and well-ordered. First is on the basis of comparison. Second is on principles to set that everyone follows. Third is on how researchers do their research. Also, they borrow concepts from other studies, may it be about minds, society, human beings, and reasoning. The same goes for how they do their research.\nTextbooks.\nThere have been many attempts to bring together the skills and the knowledge needed by teachers. The following (mostly multi-author) books are examples.\nAERA journals and publications.\nThe American Educational Research Association publishes many journals on teaching."}

It was created to coincide with the Lego Ninjago line of construction toys, which is based on the characters and events of the series. It centres on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of six teenage ninjas and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. The storyline was written by Dan and Kevin Hageman until the ninth season; their successor as the head writer is Bragi Schut. The show features a large ensemble cast of voice actors who have recurring roles in the series. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run. The music is scored by composers Michael Kramer and Jay Vincent.\nThe series has been in continuous production for over ten years and celebrated its ten-year anniversary in January 2021. It began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from December 2011 to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years with the second season planned as the original ending. However, the success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing production, with fourteen seasons and two specials being released as of May 2021. \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\" was produced in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for its first ten seasons. The production was relocated to WildBrain Studios in Canada for the eleventh season and the series was retitled \"Ninjago\".\nIn Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, it premiered on Nickelodeon. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on Cartoon Network in the United States, United Kingdom, and Poland. In Latin America, the series is broadcast on Disney XD Latin America. In Canada, the series is broadcast on Teletoon and YTV.\nSynopsis.\nThe show is largely set in the fictional realm of Ninjago, a place loosely inspired by East Asian myths and culture. While featuring historically designed buildings and traditional clothing, Ninjago exists in a modern setting centered around the large metropolis of Ninjago City, which features skyscrapers, current-age, and futuristic vehicles, modern electronics, mechanical exo-suits (mechs), and other futuristic technology. The plot focuses on a group of six teenage ninja fighting against the forces of evil, who are also defined as \"Elemental Masters\", several characters who have elemental powers.\nThe series began with the ninja team being formed and trained by their ancient master Sensei Wu in the fictional martial art of \"Spinjitzu\", which is the main fighting method depicted in the show. The ninjas' base is a flying junk ship named \"Destiny's Bounty\", which has varied in design over the course of the series. The Pilot Episodes introduced the original four ninja characters named Kai, Cole, Jay, and Zane and Kai's sister Nya, while the central character Lloyd Garmadon was introduced in the first season, titled \"Rise of the Snakes\"."}

{"id": "846516", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=846516", "title": "Wow! signal", "text": "The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, which was being used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and met all the expectations of a signal of extraterrestrial origin.\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman found the signal a few days after it was received while reviewing the data printout. He was so impressed by it that he circled the text that represented the signal on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment \"Wow!\" on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.\nThe entire signal was detected for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, even though many, such as Ehman, have tried to. Many explanations have been given on where the signal comes from, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them are good enough to explain the signal.\nAlthough the Wow! signal had no detectable changes which would have allowed the signal send information, it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.\nBackground.\nIn a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi made an educated guess that any extraterrestrial civilization trying to communicate with radio signals might do so using a frequency of megahertz ( centimeters), which is naturally emitted by hydrogen, which is the most common element in the universe, and is likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.\nIn 1973, after completing a survey of radio sources coming from other galaxies, Ohio State University assigned the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of this kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.\nBy 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved going through (by hand) large amounts of data processed by a computer and recorded on paper. While looking at data collected on August 15 at 22:16\u00a0EDT (02:16\u00a0UTC), he noticed a series of values of showing signal strength and frequency that left him and people he was working with amazed.\nThe event was later documented in detail by the observatory's director.\nThe string 6EQUJ5 is commonly misunderstood as a message encoded in the radio signal. This string actually represents the signal's strength over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared not to have changes that would have allowed for a message to be encoded, although any change that would have happened in less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable. The signal did, however, have a continuous wave. \nIntensity.\nThe signal strength was measured by how much more powerful it was than the average background noise over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Meaning that every 12 seconds the strength for each different frequency channel was printed on the printout as a single number or letter, representing the 10-second average strength, minus the strength of the background noise.\nIn this scale, an empty space was left for strengths between 0 and 1 standard deviations higher than the background noise. The numbers 1 to 9 showed how many standard deviations above the background noise the signal strength was. If the strength of the signal was 10 or above it would be indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponded to a strength of 10, \"B\" to 11, \"C\" to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (a strength of 30), making it thirty standard deviations above background noise.John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan. However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of . This is () above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of . If due to blue-shift, it would mean the source was moving about towards Earth. An explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper.\nThe Wow! signal was a narrowband emission: meaning its bandwidth was less than kHz. The Big Ear telescope was able to measure fifty kHz-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a a different column with the number or letters printed on it representing the strength of the signal at that range. The Wow! signal is only in one column.\nTime variation.\nAt the time the signal was heard, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and used the spinning of the Earth to listen across the sky. Given how fast the Earth spins, and how big the telescope's observation window is, the Big Ear could listen to any given point in the sky for just 72 seconds. This means that a continuous extraterrestrial signal would only be able to be heard for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded strength of such signal would display an increase for the first 36 seconds\u2014peaking at the center of the observation window\u2014and then a decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.\nCelestial location.\nThe exact spot in the sky where the signal came from is unclear because of the design of the Big Ear telescope. The telescope had two different structures (called feed horns) that listened to the sky, and both listened to the sky in slightly different directions, and would be moved along the sky by the Earth's spin. The Wow! signal was heard in one of these feed horns, but not in the other, and the data was processed in a way that makes it is impossible to determine which of the two horns heard the signal. Making two different spots in the sky where the signal could have come from.\nThe galactic coordinates for the positive horn are =11.7\u00b0, =\u221218.9\u00b0, and for the negative horn =11.9\u00b0, =\u221219.5\u00b0, both being therefore about 19\u00b0 toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24\u00b0 or 25\u00b0 east of the galactic centre. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5\u00a0degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5\u00a0degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.\nNo nearby sun-like stars were within the are that was being listened to, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six stars that are far away.\nHypotheses on the signal's origin.\nThere are a number of hypotheses as to what the Wow! signal is, and where it came from. Scientists have not gotten behind any one of these ideas. Interstellar twinkling of a weaker signal\u2014similar in effect to twinkling of stars in the sky\u2014could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being from extraterrestrials. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal not detected by the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar twinkling is low. Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or just a one-time event.\nEhman has said: \"We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris.\" He later took back his some of his doubt, after further research showed a signal coming from Earth to be very unlikely, given that whatever in space the signal would have bounced off of would have had to meet some unrealistic requirements. Also, other problems arise because the 1420\u00a0MHz signal is within a a bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes, in which radios on Earth are banned from using. In a 1997 paper, Ehman suggest that not draw \"vast conclusions from half-vast data\"\u2014 and acknowledged the possibility that the signal may have been military or from people on Earth.\nMETI president Douglas Vakoch told \"Die Welt\" that any SETI signal detections must be heard again for confirmation, and the fact that it has not been heard again making the Wow! signal have little credibility.\nDiscredited hypotheses.\nIn 2017, Antonio Paris, a teacher from Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have caused the Wow! signal. This idea was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the comets he suggested were not in the exact right spot at the correct time. Also, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies that the signal was heard, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one feed horn but not in the other.\nSearches for recurrence of the signal.\nEhman and other astronomers have tried to hear the signal again and identify it. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen. Ehman searched for a second occurence of the signal using Big Ear in the months after the detection, but it was never heard again.\nIn 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray listened for the signal using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not hear it.\u00a0 In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several observations of the Wow! signal's place in the sky with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also never hearing anything.\nIn 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.\u00a0 Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for and second occurrence of the signal in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory. Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the general point in the sky, but nothing like the Wow! signal was ever heard.\u00a0\nResponse.\nIn 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, Arecibo Observatory beamed a message at Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages that National Geographic has asked fans to send in with the hashtag \"#ChasingUFOs\" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series). The sponsor also included a series of videos with messages from several celebrities.\nTo increase the chance that any extraterrestrials that would hear it would recognize the signal as an attempt to communicate from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a header to each individual message, and sent the transmission at roughly 20 times the power of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter."}

The dance form is a reconstruction os Sadir, the art of temple dancers devadasis. Lord Shiva as Nataraja is considered the God of this dance form. Today, it is one of the most popular and widely performed dance form practiced by male and female dancers all over the world. The original name of Bharatnatyam was Sadir, Chinnamelan and Dasi Attam. A possible origin of the Bharatnatyam is that it comes after Bharata Muni, the author of Natya Shastra. Another popular etymology (explanation of the name) holds \u201cBhavan\u201d means expression, \u201cragam\u201d means melody and \u201cTalam\u201d means rhythm, finally, \u201cNatyam\u201d means dance, so the dance which has Bhavan, Ragam and Talam is called Bharatnatyam. \nAspects of Bhratnatyam.\nBharatnatyam is a solo dance with two aspects Lasya, the graceful and feminine aspects associated with Goddess Parvati and Tandava , the masculine and rigorous aspects associated with Lord Shiva.\nTraining of Bharatnatyam.\nThe Bharatnatyam training has been given its present shape by the Tanjore brothers. It begins with the practice of Adavus and then the students are taught the Margam from Pushpanjli, Kautvam, Alarippu, Jatiswaram, Sabdam, Varnam, Padams, Tilina. After many years of training, a student can perform an \u201carangetram\u201d, the first solo performance by a student. Bharatnatyam compositions are based on Carnatic Music system of Ragams and talams. It features graceful and assertive movements that are performed imaginary lines and geometrical patterns\nKathak.\nKathak is a dance form that originates from Uttar Pradesh, North India. It is said that: \u201cKatha kahe so kathak,\u201d which means that \u2018He who tells a story is a Kathak\u2019. The Kathak or professional story-teller had a thorough knowledge of the epics and mythology, village legends and local beliefs. It is said that the kathak was so adept at this art that he often kept a whole village absorbed while he sat entertaining them. \nDancing style of Kathak.\nKathak is characterised bt graceful movements, subtle expressions and sophisticated use of rhythm. Technical virtuosity and flamboyance is complimented by subtlety in the depiction of moods and emotions. Pure dance is the predominant feature of Kathak. In Kathak, the dancer addresses directly to the audience. The knees are not flexed outwards or forwards as in the other classical dance form of India. The feet, with ghungroos around the ankles, beat out a whole range of rhythmic sounds. Skill in rendering intricate beats is fundamental to the style. \nHistory of Kathak.\nAlthough, Kathak was an established tradition as a medium of worship during the Vaishnava age, it started being performed in courts with the coming of the Mughals. The dancer moved from thr temple courtyards to the palace durbar and this brought changes on the presentation as we know it today. Kathak saw a great period of glory in the 19th century during the reign of Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab of Awadh. It was under his patronage that the Lucknow gharana was established. The two other important gharanas in Kathak are the Jaipur gharana and the Banaras gharana. "}

This is what happened to Solomon Northup.\nAfter he was rescued in 1853, Solomon Northup traveled around the United States making speeches about his twelve years in the South. He did this because he wanted American voters to stop slavery. Later, he wrote down his speeches as a book. Editor David Wilson helped Northup write the book. Some people have asked whether Wilson wrote most of the book for Northup. But Wilson said that he heard Northup tell the story out loud many times without ever making a mistake or changing it and that he, Wilson, only helped Northup write it all down.\nThe book is true, but Northup and his publisher, Derby, were influenced by \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which was published one year earlier. The book is dedicated to Harriet Beecher Stowe. They marketed the book as \"another \"Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\",\" meaning that, like Stowe's book, \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\", it explained and supported \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", proving that Stowe had not lied about how bad slavery was.\nFor many years, people forgot about \"12 Years a Slave\". Historian Sue Eakin found a copy in 1930 when she was twelve years old. When she grew up, she collected proof that Northup's story was true. For example, she talked to people who had known Edwin Epps, and they said Epps had told them the story was true.\nStructure.\nThe first chapters of the book talk about Northup's family and his life as a free man in New York. He was married and had children. His wife was a cook. He had had many jobs, as a farmer and carpenter, but he could also play the violin well.\nWhile his wife is away on a cooking job, Northup meets men who say they want him to travel with them as a musician. He agrees. He makes sure he has paperwork proving he is a free man before traveling with them to Washington D.C. But when they are in the city, the men drug him and steal the papers. He wakes up in a cell because they have sold him as a slave.\nNorthup is taken south on a boat. Some of the other captives have been slaves all their lives, but others are kidnapped free men like Northup. Some of them plan to take over the boat and escape, but then they get sick and cannot. Northup, who can read and write, writes a note to a white friend in New York saying what has happened to him. One of the sailors promises to mail it for him.\nIn the rest of the book, Northup talks about living as a slave, about the people he meets, about the work he does, and about what he does to try to get home. The slavers give Northup the fake name \"Platt.\" Northup says that the first man who bought him, named Ford, was not very bad. But the second man who bought him, named Tibeats, was cruel. The third man, named Epps, was even worse. He would hit and whip slaves no matter what they did. He would wake them up and make them dance at night. The next day, Epps would beat them if they did not work as hard as if they had had a full night's sleep. Epps would force the slaves to beat and whip each other while he watched. Northup talks about coming back to his cabin to find his cabinmate, Abram, covered in blood because Epps had stabbed him with a knife. Northup talks about Patsey, a slave woman, whom Epps forces to have sex with him. Northup talks about how Epps' wife hates Patsey even though it was not her fault. One time, Patsey has gone to a friend to get a bar of soap. Epps forces Northup to whip Patsey.\nNorthup always wants to go home to his family in New York. Because he is legally a free man, his friends from New York can come and bring him home. Northup must find a way to tell them where he is. Northup tries to steal paper and ink so he can write a letter to his family in New York. But he cannot go to the post office to send a letter himself. He needs a white person to send the letter for him. The first man he asks tells Epps, and Northup barely manages to talk his way out of trouble. After some years, Northup finds a Canadian man who will send the letters for him. The Canadian does so.\nNorthup's friends and family get the letter. They talk to a white lawyer, Henry B. Northup, who talks to the governor of New York. Henry Northup is given official permission to go to Louisiana to look for Solomon Northup and bring him back to New York. Henry Northup travels to Washington D.C. to talk to a senator from Louisiana first then goes to Louisiana to talk to judges and officials. He has trouble finding Solomon Northup because he does not know he is being called \"Platt.\" Eventually, they find the Canadian, who tells them Solomon Northup's fake name. Henry Northup finds Solomon Northup and shows the county sheriff proof that Solomon Northup really is a free man. Solomon Northup goes north with Henry Northup.\nSolomon and Henry Northup stop in Washington D.C. and the men who kidnapped Solomon are put on trial. He is not allowed to testify. The men are not convicted. Then Solomon Northup goes home to his family.\nCritical analysis.\n\"12 Years a Slave\" was a best seller. It sold 25,000 copies in the first two years. It was not as popular as \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" but many people read it.\nIn modern times, book reviewers, for example the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\", have examined and studied \"12 Years a Slave\"."}

No one knows who wrote it. It is a backwards counting song in both the United States and Canada.\nLyrics.\nThe words to the song are:\nAlternative line:\nIf one of those bottles should happen to fall, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...\nWe repeat the line many times, with one less bottle each time. When there are no bottles left, a different line is used. Some lines that can be used for when there are no bottles are:\nNo more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\nGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall...\nOr:\nNo more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\nWe've taken them down and passed them around; now we're drunk and passed out!\nOther alternate lines read:\nIf that one bottle should happen to fall, what a waste of alcohol!\nOr:\nNo more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\nThere's nothing else to fall, because there's no more bottles of beer on the wall.\nSometimes, the song does not stop when there are 1 or no bottles of beer left. In this case, the song keeps going with -1, -2, -3, and so on bottles of beer.\nAndy Kaufman routine.\nAmerican comedian Andy Kaufman had a comedy bit where he would sing all 100 verses. This was considered funny because the song is not usually completed due to its length.\nAtticus.\nAtticus, a band from Knoxville, Tennessee, recorded a version of the song in front of people. It took 13 and a half minutes. It was recorded at a Glasgow, Scotland bar called The Cathouse. It was included in the 2001 album \"Figment\". Rich Stewart, also known as Barroom Rambler, called it the number one drinking song out of 86 in an article for \"Modern Drunkard Magazine\".\nMath versions.\nDonald Byrd has dozens of versions of the song. These versions are inspired by math topics. The songs written by himself and others, and some of them have been published. Byrd says that the collection is fun and a good way to teach about infinity. Among his versions are:Infinite bottles of beer on the wall,\ninfinite bottles of beer;\nIf one of those bottles should happen to fall, \ninfinite bottles of beer on the wall.Infinite bottles of beer on the wall, \ninfinite bottles of beer; \nIf finite bottles should happen to fall, \ninfinite bottles of beer on the wall.These two verses can be repeated forever."}

By late September, the seaplane carrier Wakamiya loaded up the biplanes on the deck, became the world's first aircraft carrier and headed for Qingdao. And finally, it's time for the first operation to destroyed the fortress.

In gluconeogenesis, the body turns fats and proteins (glucogenic amino acids) into sugars called glucose. In most animals with spines, gluconeogenesis happens in the liver, but some animals have gluconeogenesis in the kidneys. gluconeogenesis usually happens when the organism has not eaten many starches or sugars or eaten nothing at all for a long time. Not eating and not eating starch can cause ketosis, which is when some cells cannot use ketones for fuel.\nProcess.\nIn humans, the main gluconeogenic compounds are lactate, glycerol (a part of the triglyceride molecule), alanine and glutamine. They are mostly involved in over 90% of the overall process.\nLactate comes back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to make glucose.\nFat is mostly broken down, but if there is no fat to break down, or the body cannot access the fat stores, then proteins found in the muscle can break down, resulting in muscle loss."}

There are many variations of this diet which all focus on lowering carbohydrates and might have different advantages and disadvantages.\nOverview.\nMacronutrient ratios.\nThe National Lipid Association and Lifestyle Task force define low-carbohydrate diets and those containing less then 25% of calories from carbohydrates, and very low carbohydrate diets being those containing less than 10% carbohydrates. A 2016 review of low-carbohydrate diets referred to diets with 50g of carbohydrate per day (less than 10% of total calories) as \"very low\" and diets with 40% of calories from carbohydrates as \"mild\" low-carbohydrate diets.\nFoods.\nThere is evidence that the quality is also important too, and that high-fiber slow-digesting foods are healthful while ultra-processed and sugary foods are less so. People choosing diet for health conditions should have the diet focused on their own needs.\nMost vegetables are low- or moderate-carbohydrate foods. Some vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, maize (corn) and rice are high in starch. Most low-carbohydrate diet plans encourage to eat vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumbers, cauliflower, peppers and most green-leafy vegetables.\nHistory.\nFirst appearences.\nIn 1797, John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic Army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the nineteenth century.\nIn 1863, William Banting, a formerly obese English undertaker and coffin maker, published \"Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public,\" in which he described a diet for weight control giving up bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer, and potatoes. His booklet was widely read, so much so that some people used the term \"Banting\" for the activity now called \"dieting.\"\nIn the early 1900s Frederick Madison Allen made a highly restrictive short term regime which was described by Walter R. Steiner at the 1916 annual convention of the Connecticut State Medical Society as \"The Starvation Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus\". This diet was often administered in a hospital in order to better ensure following and safety."}

It was first played on November 10, 2019, as part of the twenty-ninth episode of the series's sixth season. During the twenty six-minute clip, comedian John Oliver talked about the result of a lawsuit against him from mining businessman Robert E. \"Bob\" Murray. He also talked about the harmful effects of lawsuits like that. Oliver then ended the clip with a song entitled \"Eat Shit, Bob!\" in honor of winning his lawsuit.\nBackground.\nCoal.\nOn June 18, 2017, John Oliver played a segment on his show, called \"Coal\". The segment was about the coal mining industry. Oliver began the piece by showing Donald Trump's fondness for the coal industry. He played clips of him when he was running for president in 2016 in a coal miner's hat and talking to a crowd that had miners in it. In the speech, he told the miners to prepare to work their \"asses off\" when he became President. Oliver then introduced Bob Murray, who is the head of Murray Energy.\nOliver explained that he and his team talked to Murray Energy about this segment before showing it. He said that he received a letter from Murray Energy telling him that he should cease and desist from\u2013or stop\u2013\"any efforts to [...] injure Mr. Murray\". Oliver also said that Murray has sued people before. Oliver ignored this letter. He called Murray a \"geriatric Dr. Evil\" who was \"on the same side as black lung\". Oliver also talked about other errors in the way Murray's miners were told to do their jobs. Oliver particularly talked about the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse that killed 9 people. Bob Murray argued that it was the fault of an earthquake. However, the federal government concluded that it was the fault of the dangerous way miners were told to do their jobs. The government told Murray Energy that they had to pay . This is the highest amount possible the federal government can make someone pay for doing a dangerous thing like this. Oliver then talked about Murray's program for coal miners to earn more money. The workers did not like the program. They said that it might encourage them to do dangerous things for more money. The company told the workers that they could return their money if they felt they were being encouraged to do risky things. Two miners gave back the money, writing the words \"KISS MY ASS BOB\" and \"Eat Shit Bob\" on their checks. Oliver also talked about Murray also sharing a story that he received the idea to start a coal mining business from a talking squirrel. Drawing on the two stories from before, Oliver ended the episode by introducing a squirrel mascot known as \"Mr. Nutterbutter\" (played by Noel MacNeal). Mr. Nutterbutter taunted Bob Murray by holding up an big check\u2013a piece of paper making a promise to pay money\u2013for \"three acorns and eighteen cents\". The money was addressed to \"Eat Shit, Bob!\"\nLawsuit.\nOn June 22, 2017, some companies owned by Bob Murray said that they had filed a lawsuit\u2013a complaint to a court about something wrong someone else has done to them. The lawsuit was against John Oliver, HBO, and others close to Oliver. Bob Murray said that Oliver had defamed them\u2013said untrue and bad things about Murray and his company. The plaintiffs said that they didn't like the way Oliver talked about the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse. They repeated what they had said before about the mine collapse\u2013that it was because of an earthquake and that Oliver was lying. They also said that because so many people watch Oliver's show, that he was unfairly hurting Murray. Murray wanted money from Oliver, as well as a gag order\u2013a court telling someone not to say something\u2013stopping people from watching the segment.\nSomeone who talks for HBO said that HBO was happy with the show. They that they did not believe that \"anything in the show this week violated Mr. Murray\u2019s or Murray Energy\u2019s rights\".\nOn February 24, 2018, the case was thrown away. This was because the judge agreed with HBO's argument that Murray hadn't shown that anything was wrong with what Oliver did. Bob Murray asked another court to reconsider the case. Before they could, all the justices on that court were fired. The case was dropped soon after. Oliver later said that this was a relief to him. This was because he had made a joke on his show a few years before. He said that the head Justice on the court, Allen Loughry, referred to his penis as \"The Gavel\".\nAmicus curiae.\nThe ACLU\u2013an activist group of lawyers\u2013wrote a letter to the court for Oliver. People liked the letter because it was funny and sarcastic. This is not common in that type of letter. The paper had lines such as \"You Can\u2019t Sue People for Being Mean to You, Bob\" and \"A Brief History of Plaintiffs\u2019 Attempts to Chill Speech by Abusing the Legal System.\" The letter said that Oliver's segment did not say anything that was bad for Murray. They said some of the statements were jokes, and the rest were true. The letter said that Murray was using the court as a way to force people not to say things. The argument was helped by a list of Murray's other lawsuits. The ACLU listed lawsuits thrown out by the courts against HuffPost, a newspaper in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, Bloomberg News, and other papers and activists.\nMurray didn't like the way people were talking about the letter. Murray Energy wrote their own letter to the court. It said that the court shouldn't read the letter. They said this was because ACLU didn't make it clear that they made money because of Oliver's show. The letter said that Murray didn't like the way the ACLU worded their letter. They wrote that the biased tone by itself should make the court throw away the other letter. The letter also claimed that the ACLU made money because of John Oliver's show. 5 days after the 2016 United States presidential election, Oliver's show made a segment called \"President-Elect Trump\". Oliver told to donate to activists they saw as left-leaning. These clauses included Planned Parenthood, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, The Trevor Project, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project. Murray Energy said that this encouragement caused an \"immediate surge of millions of dollars in donations to the ACLU\". Because of this, said Murray Energy, the court should throw away the ACLU's letter. \"Reuters\" argued that Murray Energy did not prove that what they said was true. They said this because Murray provided links to three articles to prove what they said. None of the articles back up what Murray said. The articles did agree that the activists got more money. However, they said that it was because of the election, and not because of Oliver's show.\nEpisode.\nOn November 10, 2019, John Oliver put out a segment on his show, called \"SLAPP Suits\". Oliver began by recapping the legal fight so far. Oliver said that even though he won the lawsuit, his insurance company tripled his monthly fee and that his show paid to the show's lawyers. Oliver then argued that Bob Murray never intended to win the case. Instead, Oliver said that Murray wanted to scare HBO and him into silence. This led Oliver into the main point of the segment\u2014SLAPP suits, which are lawsuits designed to scare people into not saying bad things about someone else, even if they are true. Oliver pointed out that Murray has filed at least nine lawsuits against news companies and journalists who have said bad things about him, including the \"Huffington Post\" and \"The New York Times\". Oliver argued that Murray has also sued those who aren't lucky enough to have the support of a large company like HBO and their own insurance. He then suggested that because those people might be scared of Murray, they won't say anything bad about him. Oliver argued that this led to almost nobody in the press writing about two sexual harassment cases against Murray. One of these cases involved Murray asking a woman employee to get on her hands and knees and find a kidney stone that Murray had passed and lost.\nOliver said that the segment was checked over by HBO's lawyers (who he joked were \"getting very tired of this\"). However, he also said that the episode would likely lead to another lawsuit from Murray. Oliver said that he would stand behind his works if it were to happen. When Judge Jeffery D. Cramer threw out Oliver's case, he noted that people are allowed to use \"loose, figurative language\". Oliver brought this up as his reason to create a musical number to end the episode.\nMusical number.\nOliver took the name of \"Eat Shit, Bob\" from the money the miner returned. He then acted in a five-minute musical number, initially set in his studio. There, he began singing slowly that \"even though he'll threaten legal Armageddon, we have just one tiny thing to say...\" Then, P;over put up his middle finger and exclaimed \"Bob Murray can go fuck himself today!\" He then introduced the \"Suck My Balls, Bob\" dancers. The dancers to Times Square as they recounted fake stories of Murray doing crazy and terrible things. They joked that he caused the 1994 Cobo Arena attack on Nancy Kerrigan, shot puppies into outer space, supplied drugs to Bill Cosby, murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and started World War I, and was the unidentified Zodiac Killer. Oliver based parts of the song on his legal defense. He sang that \"we made up these anecdotes, they're silly and insane\". He also said in the beginning of the piece that \"If we discuss Bob Murray in a way no reasonable person could construe as factual, we can say whatever the fuck we like!\" Mr. Nutterbutter came back with a barbershop quartet in squirrel costumes. They joked that Bob Murray practiced bestiality with squirrels. Brian d'Arcy James also made an appearance as HBO's legal counsel. At first, he told everyone to stop singing and dancing. Then, James went into his own segment. There, he recounted Bob Murray forcing tourists at the New York City M&amp;M's Store to watch as he \"crammed them (M&amp;M's) up his anal hole.\" The number was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.\nReaction.\nAn opinion from the \"Charleston Gazette-Mail\" said that there was \"a lesson in John Oliver roasting Bob Murray\". The lesson was that we should think about why states like West Virginia have relaxed anti-SLAPP laws.\nThe musical number was well-liked. \"The A.V. Club\" said that the episode was a demonstration in \"why rich assholes really shouldn\u2019t sue John Oliver\". They also said that the musical number was \"glorious\" and \"over-the-top\". \"Slate\" said that just because Oliver gave an \"impassioned speech standing up for all the small outlets and independent activists bullied into silence by SLAPP lawsuits,\" that does not mean John Oliver \"has matured even a little bit\".\n\"The Mary Sue\" commented that Bob Murray's SLAPP suits create a \"culture of fear in which Murray ends up able to succeed in his goal of stifling any criticism of him and his industrial operations\". However, they also say that Murray \"may have picked too big a fish\" in John Oliver, adding that \"Of course, this is John Oliver we\u2019re talking about and 'culture of fear' is basically his Bat-Signal.\""}

The goals are to bring order to the bibliographic catalogues, to improve communication among catalogues and finally, to make getting information research brought to them faster. CANTIC treats those who control name and title authorities related with Catalan culture in a higher regards. These authorities receive a complete authority work and are provided, eventually, access to the Catalonia Encyclopedia or known locally as Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana.\nDefinition and aims.\nCANTIC has the aim to be the catalogue of authority records created cooperatively by Catalan libraries. These records have to be generated from the authority control of name, name-title and title access points of Catalan bibliographic records. This guarantees the standardization and uniqueness of access points of catalogues, which makes it easier the exchange and a more efficient communication of bibliographic records and, in the end, enables users to carry out assisted, precise and exhaustive searches. \nCANTIC is a national service that allows to standardize and give consistency to the catalogues of the Catalan library system; it is the tool that facilitates the creation of the future Unique Catalogue of Catalonia (CUC), devised in the frame of the Agreement of the Catalan Government of 20 July 2004, for the improvement and modernization of Catalan Library System.\nHistory and evolution.\nAt a meeting held on 16 September 2002, the Advisory Commission of Cataloguing, the advisory body of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in terms of cataloguing, talked about the need of creating a list of authorities in Catalonia. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to study the technical feasibility of the project and to prepare the requirements and functionality of the list of name and title authorities, taking into account the real needs of the Catalan Library System. The Subcommittee met for the first time on 27 March 2003 and finished the job in October 2003. In the report prepared by them are presented:\nThe Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia was created following the Catalan Library System Act, Llei 4/1993 \u201cLa Biblioteca de Catalunya supervisa, valida i unifica en un sol llistat el cat\u00e0leg d\u2019autoritats\"\nParticipants.\nThe participants are the Biblioteca de Catalunya, the Casa \u00c0sia, the Centre de Lectura (Reus), the Consorci de Biblioth\u00e8ques de les Universitats de Catalunya, the Il\u2022lustre Col\u2022legi d'Advocats de Barcelona, the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, the Universitat de Barcelona, the Universitat de Girona, the Universitat de Lleida, the Universitat de Vic, the Universitat Jaume I, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili.\nMaintenance and updating.\nThe authority records of CANTIC are created following the international cataloguing principles and the specifications of the Biblioteca de Catalunya, which were approved by the CCUC. Records are encoded with MARC 21. There is also a CANTIC guide with the procedure for elaborating the authority records by the entities involved. The Bibliographic Standardization Service is responsible for providing training and support to all participants while ensuring the quality of authority records. The constant introduction of new authority records turns CANTIC into a living organism in a permanent process of transformation and change. Updating the content of the database is done monthly and is available on the website of the Biblioteca de Catalunya."}

However, because the value of Colombia\u2019s currency is extremely low. Although 1 centavo and 5 centavo coins still exist, the lowest denomination of the Colombian peso that is commonly used is the 50 pesos coin.\nThe central bank of Colombia \u2013 Banco de la Rep\u00fablica \u2013 is the entity tasked with issuing Colombian currency and with monitoring and controlling the foreign exchange rate for the peso.\nColombian Peso Currency.\nThe peso was first produced in 1810, when it replaced the Spanish real. At that time, the peso was pegged to the real at an exchange rate of 8 reals to 1 peso. During the rest of the 19th century, Colombian currency included gold and silver coins in varying denominations, up to a 10 peso gold coin. Modern Colombian coins are minted, like those of other currencies, using primarily copper and nickel alloys.\nIn the early 20th century, the Colombian peso was pegged to the British pound sterling. Still, the government transferred the peg to the US dollar in 1931 at an exchange rate of 1.05 pesos to 1 US dollar, when Britain abandoned the gold standard. The peg to the US dollar remained until 1949, when continuing inflation in Colombia forced the central bank to abandon the US dollar peg.\nColombia ceased minting all centavos coins \u2013 those with a value of less than 1 peso \u2013 in 1984. In the most recently minted coin series in Colombia \u2013 the 2012 series \u2013 the lowest denomination coin minted and in circulation is the 50 pesos coin. Coins are also minted in denominations of 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos.\nColombian banknotes are printed in denominations of 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 pesos. The 50,000 peso banknote is distinguished by the fact that, unlike most banknotes of any currency, its image is printed vertically instead of horizontally.\nThe Colombian Economy.\nDespite its inflation problems, Colombia\u2019s economy continues to thrive and grow remarkably, with the country\u2019s GDP growth rate reaching as high as nearly 7% in recent years.\nOver the past century, the Colombian economy\u2019s undergone a dramatic transition, changing from an almost entire agrarian economy to an economy where the services sector accounts for more than half of the country\u2019s GDP.\nKey Colombian exports include oil, coal, cut flowers, bananas, textiles, and emeralds. The country\u2019s mines produce 80%-90% of the world\u2019s total supply of emeralds. Colombia conducts substantial import-export trade worldwide. Its principal trading partners include both China and the United States.\nHowever, despite its overall strong economic performance, Colombia faces consistently high poverty and unemployment rates. Just over 25% of the country\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, with unemployment rates fluctuating between 9% and 12% in recent years."}

The major songs from the group include \"One Thing Leads to Another\" and \"Saved by Zero\". Both were released during 1983.\nCollege partners Cy Curnin (for the vocals) and Adam Woods (drums) got together and formed the group in 1979. At first the group called themselves the Portraits. The pair were later joined by keyboardist Rupert Greenall, guitarist Tony McGrail and the bassist Russell Mckenzie. The last was replaced by Charlie Bennett. The Portraits issued two records under Ariola Records: \"Little Women\" (1979) and \"Hazards in the Home\" (1980). \nLater in 1980, McGrail left the band. At this point, the band adde guitarist Jamie West-Oram. The band then changed their name to The Fix. This version of the band recorded under 101 Records. They had their first single \"Lost Planes\" in February 1981. In those early days, West-Oram was simply billed as Jamie West.\nThe Fix's raised profile led to them being offered a contract by MCA Records. The record label, however, worried about the potential drug user implication of the group's name. MCA wanted a name change before signing them to the label. A deal was then reached. The band changed the spelling of its name to The Fixx.\nThe group's first studio album was \"Shuttered Room\" in 1982. This album had the initial hit songs \"Stand or Fall\" and \"Red Skies\". Both in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.\nThe group's second album \"Reach the Beach\", was their most commercially successful album. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The singles \"One Thing Leads to Another\" and \"Saved by Zero\" were released off the album. Both these singles hit the U.S. Top 40. \"One Thing Leads to Another\" was the band's biggest hit (#1 in Canada, #4 in the United States).\nThe 1984 album \"Phantoms\" had the hits \"Are We Ourselves?\" and \"Sunshine in the Shade\".\nIn 1986, the group had their fourth album \"Walkabout\". This album had the single \"Secret Separation\". The songhit #1 on \"Billboard\" Magazine's Album Rock Chart.\nIn 1989 the Fixx had their only release for RCA Records, \"Calm Animals\". The album had another #1 hit on the Album Rock chart, \"Driven Out\".\nThe band released other albums between 1990 and 2012."}

Bisho was in the independent homeland of Ciskei. Ciskei is now part of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. During a protest march, members of the Ciskei Defence Force shot twenty-eight African National Congress supporters and one soldier when they attempted to enter Bisho (now renamed to Bhisho). The ANC supporter wanted that Ciskei was again made part of South Africa. The massacre happened during the final years of apartheid.\nBackground.\nBhisho (previously spelled \"Bisho\") was the capital of the Ciskei. Ciskei was a nominally independent homeland (bantustan) for the Xhosa people in South Africa. The government of Ciskei was formed in 1961 under the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 after the South African government declared it a separate administrative territory. In 1972, the status was changed to self-governing territory. At the same time, there were stronger efforts to forcibly remove Xhosa-speakers to Ciskei. On 4 December 1982, Ciskei became an independent republic, recognised only by the South African government and other 'independent' homeland states in South Africa. The system of racially segregated homelands had been a core of apartheid, but between 1990 and 1994, negotiations were taking place between the government of South Africa and the African National Congress (ANC) to end the apartheid system.\nThe negotiations would likely lead to multi-racial democratic elections. For this reason, the the ANC wanted to organise and mobilise its supporters in the Ciskei, because it lay in the Eastern Cape area. The Eastern Cape area had been a stronghold for ANC supporters. Its military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo resisted this and prevented the ANC from organising. In 1991, Gqozo formed the African Democratic Movement to counter the ANC in Ciskei. In December of the same year, he was part of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) negotiations. Codesa was a forum made up of government (National Party) and non-government interest groups to negotiate a new constitution and the transition to democracy in South Africa. In March 1992, Gqozo accused the ANC of planning to overthrow him and in August he stopped ANC marchers from entering Ciskei from King William's Town, a town in South Africa, which is close enough to Ciskei.\nProtest march and massacre.\nOn 3 September, the ANC sent a memorandum to President F. W. de Klerk: it demanded that he replace Gqozo with a temporary administration which would permit free democratic activity in Ciskei. De Klerk refused, on the grounds that the Ciskei did not fall under South Africa's jurisdiction. At the time, negotiations had broken down, with the ANC withdrawing following the Boipatong massacre and accusing De Klerk's government of fostering the violence.\nAs a result, the ANC began a campaign of \"mass action\", organising a protest march to occupy Bisho and force Gqozo's resignation. Gqozo sought a court ruling to prevent the march, and the magistrate ruled that it could take place at the homeland's independence stadium, outside Bisho, but could not enter the capital. The ANC refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the Ciskei court.\nOn 7 September, about 80,000 protesters gathered outside Bisho, signalling the wide opposition to Gqozo's rule. The meeting was led by senior ANC leaders including South African Communist Party Secretary General Chris Hani, Cyril Ramaphosa, Steve Tshwete and Ronnie Kasrils.\nA razor wire was erected on the border between South Africa and Ciskei to prevent the marchers from entering Bisho. When Kasrils led a group trying to break through the Ciskei Defence Force lines to enter Bisho, Ciskei Defence Force soldiers opened fire on the marchers with automatic weapons, killing 28 marchers and one soldier, and injuring over 200. More than 425 rounds were fired, the first fusillade lasting one and a half minutes, and the second lasting a minute.\nVarious inquiries agreed that the order to fire came from Colonel Vakele Archibald Mkosana, who incorrectly told his commanders by radio that his troops were under fire, and was given permission to return fire. Rifleman Mzamile Thomas Gonya was also found to have opened fire with a grenade launcher, killing one marcher.\nGoldstone Commission.\nThe Goldstone Commission had the task of investigating the massacre, and Justice Richard Goldstone condemned Gqozo for preventing political activity in Ciskei as well as for the lethal brutality of the Ciskei Defence Force troops. It dismissed his claim that the demonstrators had fired first. A Ciskei soldier who died during the shooting had been shot by a fellow soldier, in error. It recommended strong action against Gqozo and those responsible. It also condemned Ronnie Kasrils for leading marchers breaking through the razor wire and provoking the forces into opening fire.\nAftermath.\nOn 8 September 1992, a day after the massacre, the ANC released a statement demanding that Oupa Gqozo be removed as the leader of Ciskei, Section 43 of the Ciskei National Security Act which prevented political activity in Ciskei be revoked and South African Military Intelligence officials be removed from Ciskei.\nIn the end, the massacre led to new negotiations between the ANC and the government. Nelson Mandela met De Klerk on 26 September and signed a Record of Understanding. This Record created an independent body to oversee police operations.\u00a0\nGqozo remained in power in Ciskei but resigned shortly before the elections of 27 April 1994.\nA granite monument was erected on the site of the massacre, outside Independence Stadium, off Maitland Road between Bhisho and King William's Town. It was unveiled by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1997. The victims were buried in Ginsberg township outside King William's Town.\nEach year during the month of September, the Bisho Massacre Memorial Lecture is held to commemorate the massacre and different leaders from around South Africa take part in it.\nTruth Commission hearing and prosecution.\nOnly two applications for amnesty for the massacre were received by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, from Colonel Mkosana, who gave the order to open fire, and Rifleman Gonya, who fired a grenade launcher. Gqozo agreed to testify before the TRC, but failed to appear after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital suffering from depression.\nIn 2000, both Mkosana and Gonya were denied amnesty on the grounds that their actions were reckless and disproportionate and not associated with a political motive.\nFollowing their failure to receive amnesty, Mkosana and Gonya were charged with one count of murder and Mkosana with 28 counts of culpable homicide. They were found not guilty on all charges on the grounds of self-defence.\nSpeaking at a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing on the massacre,Col Silence Pita, revealed that Gqozo had received a message which said that the Mkhonto Wesizwe was planning coup and would take us where we didn't want to be \" but the source of the information had not been made clear in the report. Pita said security arrangements for an African National Congress march on September 7, 1992 were left to the Ciskei Defence Force.\nFormer Ciskei foreign affairs minister Mickey Webb testified that South Africa's intelligence services caused a confrontation between Ciskei government and the ANC. He claimed that South African Military Intelligence and Ciskei's own intelligence agency fed the Ciskei government with misinformation \"which could only have ended up in confrontation between the authorities and the ANC\"."}

The owner had gone outside to investigate, because he had heard gunshots. An unexploded bomb (with nails strapped to it) was found in the restaurant, close to the main entrance.\nMassacre.\nDuring the years of apartheid, Observatory was one of the few \"de facto\" \"grey\" suburbs where all races lived together. On the evening of 30 December 1993, three men entered a popular student venue on Station Road, called the Heidelberg Tavern and opened fire, killing four people and injuring five. The three APLA operatives - Humphrey Luyanda Gqomfa, Vuyisile Brian Madasi and Zola Prince Mabala - were convicted in November 1994 for what became known as the Heidelberg Massacre. On 16 July 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission granted the three amnesty."}

Doctors did not know about germs, so many soldiers caught infections. They did have anesthesia, so they were able to stop soldiers' pain. Most doctors in the United States had two years of schooling. Harvard Medical School did not have even one microscope.\nOne problem was that, like in World War I, people had just invented new weapons, like the Mini\u00e9 ball. Guns with rifled barrels did not miss as often as the muskets from the Revolutionary War and other earlier wars did. That meant doctors did not already know how to treat the injuries that these weapons could cause in the human body. Another problem was that the camps and battlefields were very dirty. A soldier in the American Civil war was twice as likely to die of disease as of a battle injury.\nDiseases.\n560,000 soldiers died of diseases during the American Civil War. Malaria was a problem in the American Civil War. Doctors gave patients quinine for malaria. Soldiers also died of dysentery, diarrhea, and typhoid.\nGerms.\nMost doctors did not know about germs in the mid-1800s. They did not always wash their hands or tools between patients. They also thought that pus, if thick and creamy, was \"laudable pus\" and meant the patient was getting better. Really, pus means the patient has an infection.\nInjuries.\nAbout 200,000 people had injuries in the American Civil War.\nAnesthesia.\nAnesthesia was invented in 1846. Doctors in the American Civil War did have chloroform, ether, and other anesthetics, and they used them. 90 percent of patients who had a limb cut off had anesthesia first, usually chloroform. The doctors dripped chloroform onto a cloth and then put it over the patient's face.\nAmputation.\nDoctors invented two ways to do amputations, the circular method and the fish-mouth method. There were so many amputations in the American Civil War that doctors became very good at amputating. The Mini\u00e9 ball and other new weapons could destroy large pieces of bone, so the doctors decided to amputation so the patient would not get gangrene.\nField stations and hospitals.\nFirst, injured soldiers were brought to field stations near the battle. There, medical people gave the soldiers whiskey if they had it and put bandages on them. Then, the patients were taken to hospitals. The \"hospital\" could be only a barn or other building where the doctors had decided to work. They were not always organized well. There, the medical people did triage: they looked at the patient to plan what to do next. They divided patients into three groups: patients who were sure to die soon, patients who needed surgery and other patients. From there, some soldiers were sent to better hospitals in the bigger cities. Patients could be taken from place to place in different ways. General George B. McClellan started an ambulance corps in 1862, and the Confederacy soon made their own. There were also hospital trains, or steamboats called \"sanitary steamers.\"\nResponse.\nIn 1861, the United States government (Union side, the North) created the U.S. Sanitary Commission to learn how to stop soldiers from becoming sick during wartime. Frederick Law Olmstead led the commission. He told the army to have clean camps, good food, and hospitals with ventilation.\nMany doctors learned much about the human body, disease and injuries during the American Civil War. Many of them wrote down what they saw and did. Between 1870 and 1888, these doctors published a book, \"Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion\".\nIn 1861, Dorothea Dix became head of the United States Nursing Corps. Professional nursing became more important in the United States."}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 4, 1994. In the episode, Bart Simpson breaks his leg and must stay in his house. He starts spying on his neighbor Ned Flanders' house and starts to think he is a murderer. The episode was written by Dan McGrath and Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. It took more time to make the episode than normal because an earthquake hit while it was being made.\nStory.\nIn a heat wave, Homer buys a swimming pool for his children Bart and Lisa. Many children from their neighborhood come to their house to go in their pool. Bart tries to jump in the pool from his tree house. Nelson makes him miss the jump and Bart breaks his leg from falling. He must wear a cast over the summer. \nThe other children do not want to talk to Bart while he is in a cast. He makes himself stay in his room. He gets a telescope and uses it to spy on his neighbors. He hears a scream and sees Ned Flanders burying something. Bart starts to think he has murdered his wife Maude. While this happens, the swimming pool makes Lisa very popular. However, Martin Prince gets a bigger pool and gets all of the children to go to his pool.\nBart sees Ned tell his children Rod and Todd that Maude is \"with God\" and they will be with her soon. Bart thinks he will murder Rod and Todd too. Bart makes Lisa go to Ned's house while he is not there. Ned comes back and Lisa gets in his attic. Bart goes in Ned's house and sees him walking to the attic with an axe. Bart thinks he will hurt Lisa with it and tells him to stop. Ned sees Bart and Lisa and puts away his axe. When Bart tells Ned that he thinks he murdered Maude, Ned faints.\nThe Simpson family and the police learn that Maude was actually at a camp for Christians. They also learn that Ned was burying a plant that died because he gave it too much water. The police gets the plant and gets Ned to make the scream Bart heard before. Later, Martin's pool breaks because there were too many children in it.\nProduction.\n\"Bart of Darkness\" was written by Dan McGrath and Jim Reardon is the director. The episode was suppose to be at the end of the 5th season. However, this and \"Lisa's Rival\" were being made during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The earthquake hurt the building that animators and producers used to work on episodes. They could not go in the building for three months and had to work in a different building. Producers were given more time to work on the episode. Jim Reardon said the more time helped him put more details in the episode, for example, Bart getting stuck in a chair and him wearing underwear instead of a swimsuit.\nAt the start of the episode, the town of Springfield is in a heat wave. Part of what the Simpson family does in the heat wave was similar to what the producers would do in a heat wave. McGrath used to go in front of freezers when he was a child. In the episode, there is a truck with a pool in it that goes to the Simpson family's neighborhood. David Mirkin used to have a truck with an amusement ride in it around his neighborhood as a child. Ned Flanders' scream was done by Tress MacNeille instead of his voice actor Harry Shearer. Krusty the Clown does not say Ravi Shankar's name right in the episode. This was not suppose to happen, but Mirkin liked it and wanted to keep it in the episode.\nReception.\nMike Duffy from the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" said the episode shows that \"The Simpsons\" was \"just as strong and funny as it ever was\". Elaine Liner from the \"Corpus Christi Caller-Times\" called the episode's writing \"crisp\" and \"hilarious\". Liner liked the references to pop culture and enjoyed when it was shown that Maude was at a camp for Christians. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\") thought it was hilarious to see how Ned Flanders was not actually a murderer. Tim Knight from Reel.com said it was a \"terrific\" episode to start the 6th season."}

If the aggregate score is level at the end of normal time of the second leg, the away goals rule is no longer applied starting from this season. To decide the winner of the tie, extra time is played, and if the same amount of goals are scored by both teams during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the preliminary round, where single-match semi-finals and final are hosted by one of the participating teams, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, and if the same amount of goals are scored by both teams during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draws for each round, teams are seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs (or the administrative \"home\" team in the preliminary round matches) in each tie decided by draw. As the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply takes the seeding of its opponent.

Falcata was one of the first games released on PlayStation in Japan, and for sure it was a strange one, the game is a mix between an strategy board game and a RPG game. In the game screen, the game draws a line connecting some different circles on a map, given a genuine and bizarre sense of atmosphere.\nStory.\nThe falcata is a type of sword typical of Pre-Roman Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, modern Spain and Portugal), similar to the Greek kopis or Nepalese kukri. The term Falcata is not ancient. It seems to have been coined by Fernando Fulgosio in 1872, on the model of the Latin expression ensis falcatus \"sickle-shaped sword\" (which, however, refers to the Harpe). He presumably went with falcata rather than falcatus because the Spanish word for sword espada is feminine, although there are other presumable theories. The name caught on very quickly, and is now firmly entrenched in the scholarly literature.\nGameplay.\nThe game is set in 1500 BC in a land with different cities and hostile tribes, that makes most of the people to travel to other lands. The goal of the game is to restore the land so the people can stop their endless wandering, and finally arrived to that land and that will end with the tribal fights. The player's character will be the hero to reach that? Only time will tell.\nThe game features 6 different parties that can be customized in their clothes and hair, all of them with their own stats. The gameplay is about going around those places and examine them, in some of them you will have to fight and then the game takes the usual rpg style with turns to choose the proper actions that the player wants his characters to do. But instead of fights he can also pay to avoid the fights, make pacts or discover relics, etc.\nDescription.\nManufacturer's description:\nSet in ancient Persia, simulation strategy of all parties ploy Mujin movement intertwined with free will. Become the leader of the party up to 5 people, and nurture a character and fighting bandits or find items to explore the field, encountered, we will proceed with the sabotage to the other party at times, prosperity Asutoran city of illusion I will win.\n\u00a0Features:"}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 9, 1995. The episode was written by Mike Scully and Bob Anderson is the director. In the episode, Santa's Little Helper mates with another greyhound at a race track. Mr. Burns wants to take their puppies to make a tuxedo out of them. \nStory.\nSanta's Little Helper, the Simpson family's dog, runs to a race track and mates with a greyhound there. The owner of the racing greyhound lets the Simpson family keep her. She gives birth to 25 puppies. Homer and Marge are not able to take care of the puppies and tries giving them away. Mr. Burns asks them for all of the puppies. Lisa does not want Burns to have them, but he takes the puppies when the family does not see them.\nBart and Lisa later learn that Burns has taken the puppies. They go to his mansion and see him cleaning the puppies in a bath. Burns sees one of the puppies standing up and calls the puppy \"Little Monty\". He then sings a song on how he will kill the other 24 puppies and make a tuxedo out of them. Bart and Lisa go in the mansion to try to get the puppies back. They put the puppies in the basement and find Burns there. Bart tries to make it so that Burns does not know which puppy is Little Monty. When Burns makes Little Monty stand, Bart uses a clothes line to make all of the puppies stand. Burns wants to kill all of the puppies and Bart and Lisa, but then thinks he should not kill them all. He instead puts all of the puppies in greyhound racing and gets millions of dollars from it.\nProduction.\n\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" was written by Mike Scully. Bob Anderson is the director of the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the story of the episode. They got the idea after seeing the movie \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\". David Mirkin said as a joke that they like to take ideas from Disney. For example, another episode called \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\" is a parody of the movie \"Mary Poppins\". Mirkin thought it was great that they could use ideas from Disney in a \"completely legal way\".\nMatt Groening (creator of \"The Simpsons\") was happy with the episode because it reminded him of the very first episode (\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\"). He also liked the references to \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\". He liked the movie when he was a child and said it made him want to learn about animation and cartoons. In one part of the movie, the puppies can be seen watching cartoons on a television screen. Groening said that made him love how cartoons work and made him create a fictional television show in \"The Simpsons\" called \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show\".\nIn the episode, Mr. Burns says Little Monty reminds him of the actor Rory Calhoun. George Meyer got the idea for Mr. Burns to say that. Matt Groening did not want this in the episode because he thought people watching it would not know who Calhoun was. This was kept in because Calhoun would be talked about again during the end of the episode. After the episode was broadcast, Groening went on the Internet and saw discussions from people who did not know who Calhoun was.\nWhen Bart and Lisa first go near Mr. Burns' mansion, they see him singing a song called \"See My Vest\". It is about how he will kill the puppies and make a tuxedo out of them. One writer came up with the idea that Mr. Burns will show the bad things he will do to the puppies with a \"fun and light\" song. Scully made the lyrics to the song on the next day. The lyrics are a parody of the song \"Be Our Guest\" from \"Beauty and the Beast\". Mirkin liked the song and said \"The rhymes are really clever. It's one of our very best songs\". He also liked that one song can be put in the episode without the episode becoming a musical. He said \"We'll just do one song and that's plenty. We have fun with that and then we're out.\"\nAnimals in many cartoons may act like humans. Groening does not want this happening in \"The Simpsons\" and makes animals in the show act like real animals. This is how the animals in the episode act. Mirkin said they might not do this only for visual gags. Everything else has animals acting how they would in real life. Frank Welker made the animal sounds in the episode. Mirkin was happy with Welker's work and said \"He can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy\". Groening also thought he was very good at making animal sounds.\nProducers and the people with Fox network's censors got into an argument if they should show Santa's Little Helper mating with the racing greyhound. Writers first thought it would not be a good idea, but Mirkin knew it could be shown without it being very sexual. In the episode, only the dogs' heads can be seen while they are mating. Storyboards of this part of the episode was later put on DVD. Anderson said that many people were laughing while the censors were looking at this part of the episode.\nReception.\nThe song \"See My Vest\" was put in the album \"Songs in the Key of Springfield\". The \"Daily Bruin\" thought the song's lyrics were humorous and said that listening to it would give memories of the episode. They thought the song really showed Mr. Burns as a character and said it shows the \"disturbing elements\" of how humans act. MSNBC made a list of \"TV's top 10 scariest characters\" and put Mr. Burns on the top of the list. They talked about \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" where Burns makes a plan on killing the puppies to make a tuxedo.\nBen Rayner from the \"Toronto Star\" thought that \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" was one episode of \"The Simpsons\" he liked the most. He thought Mr. Burns in the \"See My Vest\" song was the most interesting part. The \"Toronto Star\" later made a list of the best and worst episodes of \"The Simpsons\". They put this episode as one of the best and said \"See My Vest\" was the best part of the episode. Todd Glichrist from IGN called the episode \"memorable\" and talked about \"See My Vest\" by saying Mr. Burns \"flirts with copyright infringement\". Michael Price from IGN thought the song was just a great as \"The Monorail Song\" from the episode \"Marge vs. the Monorail\". Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide liked the references to many Disney movies and to Roy Calhoun. Jacobson said this made it a \"fine show\"."}

In most cases, people who are vaccinated will no longer get the disease. In some cases, people who have been vaccinated will still catch the disease they have been vaccinated against. This is known as breakthrough infection. In some cases, vaccines do not provide immunity against the pathogen. Breakthrough infections have been described for diseases such as mumps, varicella (chicken pox), and influenza. As the person has been vaccinated, the disease will look different, in most cases: Usually, the symptoms will be milder, and it may not last as long (compared to someone who has not been vaccinated, and who naturally contracted the disease).\nThere are different causes for breakthrough infections: The vaccine may not have been stored properly, or there may have been an error, when the person was vaccinated. Viruses change over time. The vaccine may have been developed for another version of the virus, and it may not be as effective against the current version. Also, antibodies may block the vaccine. \nFor these reasons, vaccines are not 100% effective: The common flu vaccine is estimated to provide immunity to the flu in 58% of those vaccinated. The measles vaccine fails to provide immunity to 2% of children that receive the vaccine. However, if herd immunity exists, it typically prevents individuals who are ineffectively vaccinated from contracting the disease. Accordingly, herd immunity reduces the number of breakthrough infections in a population.\nIn April 2021, the CDC reported that in the United States there were 5,814 COVID-19 breakthrough infections, and 74 deaths, among the more than 75 million people fully vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus.\nCauses.\nAge.\nAs a person grows older, their immune system change. This process is called immunosenescence. They will produce fewer naive T cells, and naive B cells. There is a reduced number of lymphocytes (T and B cells). This means that in older people, there are fewer lymphocytes, and they are also fewer types of different lymphocytes that can respond to the pathogens in a vaccine. \nFor this reason, many vaccines are less effective in adults over the age of 65. Despite this, the CDC recommend that people of this age group still get the flu vaccine: An influenza infection is particularly dangerous to them and the vaccine can provide at least some immunity to the influenza virus.\nAntibody interference.\nInfants have antibodies from their mother. This limits the efficacy of many vaccines. Maternal antibodies can bind to the proteins produced by the virus in the vaccine. Maternal antibodies can also neutralize the virus. The maternal antibodies help the immune system of the infant, which isn't very active yet: the infant produces fewer antibodies. This means that few memory B cells are produced. The level of memory B-cells is not adequate to ensure an infant's lifelong resistance to the pathogen.\nIn most infants, maternal antibodies disappear twelve to fifteen months after birth. Vaccines given to infants older than 12-15 months are not compromised by maternal antibody interference.\nLifespan of memory B cells.\nWhen a person is vaccinated against a disease, the person's immune system is triggered and memory B cells store the specific antibody response. These cells remain in circulation, the pathogen infection is cleared. Cell division is not perfect, so the information about the response slowly disappears. Typically, the cells live for multiple decades. The lifespan and protection also depend on the type and dosage of the vaccine. \nThe reason why some memory B cells live longer than others currently unknown. However, it has been proposed that the differences in memory B cell longevity are due to the speed at which a pathogen infects the body and the number and type of cells involved in the immune response to the pathogen in the vaccine.\nVirus evolution.\nWhen a person is vaccinated, their immune system develops antibodies that recognize specific segments of viruses or viral-induced proteins. Over time, however, viruses accumulate genetic mutations which changes the structure of viral proteins. If these mutations occur in sites that are recognized by antibodies, the mutations block antibody binding, which inhibits the immune response. This phenomenon is called antigenic drift. Breakthrough infections of Hepatitis B and mumps are partially attributed to antigenic drift.\nVaccine quality and administration.\nSometimes, the vaccine that is used has a poor quality. Examples may be vaccines stored at the wrong temperature, or vaccines used after the expiration date. Similarly, the correct vaccine dosage is essential. Vaccine dosage is dependent on factors including a patient's age and weight. Patients that receive a lower dose than recommended of a vaccine do not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine to ensure immunity.\nIn order for a vaccine to be effective, a person must respond to the pathogens in a vaccine through the adaptive branch of the immune system and that response must be stored in an individual's immunological memory. It is possible for an individual to neutralize and clear a pathogen through the humoral response without activating the adaptive immune response. Vaccines with weaker or fewer strains of a pathogen may primarily cause the humoral response: As a consequence, they fail to ensure future immunity."}

The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup took place for the first time in New Zealand.\nHost selection.\nFour FIFA member associations officially submitted their bids to host the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup by the deadline of 11 February 2011. On 3 March 2011, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held for the first time in New Zealand. This is the third FIFA competition staged in this country, after the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.\nVenues.\nAuckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington and Whangarei were the 7 cities chosen to host the competition.\nBefore the stadium announcements were made, Dunedin City council suggested in January 2013, that it would not bid to host matches at Forsyth Barr Stadium (also known as Otago Stadium) unless the costs (an estimated $1m) could be lowered. The stadium hosted seven matches there, the last of which being a Round of 16 game.\nQualified teams.\nIn addition to host nation New Zealand, 23 nations qualified from six separate continental competitions.\nDraw and schedule.\nThe final draw was held on 10 February 2015, 17:30 local time, at the SkyCity Grand, Auckland. For the draw, the 24 teams were divided into four seeding pots:\nAs a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage. As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place on 23 March 2015 in Dakar, Senegal, at the tournament's conclusion to determine the groups where the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed CAF teams would play in, to ensure there was no manipulation of games in the qualifying tournament ensuring fairness to all qualified teams.\nThe schedule of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 21 referees, 6 support referees, and 42 assistant referees were selected for the tournament.\nSquads.\nThe 24 squads were officially announced by FIFA on 21 May 2015. Each participating national association had to submit a final list of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) at least 10 days before the tournament started. These players were shortlisted from a provisional list of 35 players, including a minimum of four goalkeepers. All players must have been born on or after 1 January 1995. If a player listed in the final squad suffered a serious injury up until 24 hours before the kick-off of his team's first match, he could be replaced by a player from the provisional list with the approval of FIFA's medical and organising committees.\nIn July 2015, it was reported that the New Zealand squad had included an ineligible player, South African Deklan Wynne not having completed the requisite period of residence in New Zealand.\nGroup stage.\nThe winners and runners-up of each group and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16. The rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows:\nAll times are local, New Zealand Standard Time ().\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best ranked third-placed teams also advanced to the round of 16. They were paired with the winners of groups A, B, C and D, according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of regular time (two periods of 45 minutes), extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. In the case of the third place match, as it was played just before the final, extra time was skipped and a penalty shoot-out took place if necessary.\nThe third-placed teams which advanced to the round of 16 were placed with the winners of groups A, B, C and D according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award.\nOrganization.\nEmblem and mascot.\nThe official emblem of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013. The official mascot, a black sheep named Wooliam, was unveiled on 30 November 2014.\nTicketing.\nPrior to being released for 'General sale' on 13 June 2014, registered footballers in New Zealand were given 'priority treatment' by allowing them the option to buy tickets from two months earlier.\nIn the first three months of tickets going on sale to residents, an estimated 25,000 were sold."}

It lasted for 23 seconds and leveled 90 percent of Tangshan\u2019s buildings. The earthquake came during the heat of midsummer, and many stunned survivors crawled out of their ruined houses naked, covered only in dust and blood. The earthquake started fires and ignited explosives and poisonous gases in Tangshan\u2019s factories. Water and electricity were cut off, and rail and road access to the city was destroyed.\nAt the 3:42\u00a0a.m., an earthquake measuring between 7.8 and 8.2 magnitude on the Richter scale flattens Tangshan, a Chinese industrial city with a population of about a million people. The Chinese State Seismological Bureau (SSB) Analysis and Prediction Department was very accurate with the prediction of the earthquake, with an estimate of a major earthquake in the Tangshan region between July 22 and August 5. Despite voicing concerns, the prediction was not taken seriously. A few counties that listened to the advised saved thousands of lives by evacuating to safer areas days before the earthquake occurred.\nDeath toll.\nAccording to the official statement from the seismological department, 242,000 people were killed and as many as 700,000 were injured. On the other hand, other resources claimed causalities as high as 650,000. More than 160,000 families were left homeless, and more than 4,000 children were orphaned.\nAnother reason why the death toll had increased to an extraordinary amount was because of the aftershocks that took place 16 hours after the first quake. The aftershocks were recorded to be as high as 7.1 on the Richter Scale, which not only hampered the rescue efforts but also added to the death toll. The Chinese government had not allowed foreign aid in the city, claiming that they were capable of handling the crisis on their own. In the crucial first week after the crisis, many died from lack of medical care. Troops and relief workers lacked the kind of heavy rescue training necessary to efficiently pull survivors from the rubble."}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 25, 1994. In the episode, the Simpson family talk about romance using episodes before this one. The episode was written by Jon Vitti. David Silverman is the director of the episode. It is the second clip show of \"The Simpsons\".\nStory.\nMarge reads \"The Bridges of Madison County\" and thinks that her marriage with Homer is not romantic anymore. Homer does not believe what she thinks. On the next day, she tries getting the family to talk about romance. They can only remember times their many relationships did not work out. These are shown as parts from episodes before this one. Homer then tells the family how he and Marge met. Their children do not want to listen and watch television while Homer and Marge kiss. \nProduction.\nThis is the second clip show episode of \"The Simpsons\". The first clip show episode is \"\" from the 4th season. \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\" was written by Jon Vitti. He went with the name \"Penny Wise\" in the closing credits because he did not want to be known for writing the clip show. The episode was directed by David Silverman. The episodes that were shown in the clip show were made by John Swartzwelder, Frank Mula, David Richardson, Jeff Martin, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Matt Groening, Sam Simon, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, Nell Scovell, David M. Stern, George Meyer, Conan O'Brien, Robert Cohen, Bill Canterbury, and Dan McGrath. The Fox network wanted the producers of \"The Simpsons\" to make clip shows. This was because they needed less money to make than a normal episode. Producers thought four episodes in each season should be clip shows. This was so that they would not be stressed out on making a season with more episodes than normal. However, this was not done becuase they thought fans would not like the clip shows. The Fox network thought this could happen at first because it would cost less to make a clip show but they would still get just as much money as a regular episode in syndication.\nReception.\nMany fans of \"The Simpsons\" think that clip shows are the worst episodes of the show. TV Squad thought that it was made in a way that was still \"worth watching\" and was similar to a slideshow, but \"not quite as boring\". Other critics said it was \"not the worst\" clip show and that \"the episode title pretty much says it all\". Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that the episodes shown were good but that the clip show was not necessary.\nLisa talks about how romance was taken in a \"hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney\" and parts of it were later sold. This was used in studies on how organizations are shown in pop culture. The episode was talked about in Arab Strap's song \"The First Big Weekend\". One of the lyrics is \"It was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer.\""}

They are flighless, or near-flightless. There are three species, in two genera. The IUCN has classified them as near-threatened. The IUCN estimates that there are only about 145.000 birds left. They resemble doves in appearance. \nDescription.\nThe mesites are forest and scrubland birds that feed on insects and seeds. The brown and white-breasted mesites forage on the ground, gleaning insects from the leaves and under them, as well as low vegetation. The subdesert mesite uses its long bill to probe in the soil. Other birds, such as drongos and flycatchers, will follow mesites to catch any insects they flush and miss. Mesites are vocal birds, with calls similar to passerine song, used for territorial defence. Two or three white eggs are laid in a stick-nest located in a bush or low branch. The \"Mesitornis\" species are monogamous while \"Monias benschi\" is polygamous and unlike the other two shows significant sexual dichromatism.\nSystematics.\nThere are two genera, \"Mesitornis\" (2 species) and \"Monias\" (subdesert mesite).\nHistorically, mesites phylogenetics relations were not very clear and have been allied with the Gruiformes, Turniciformes and Columbiformes.\nRecent phylogenomic studies support Pterocliformes (sandgrouse) as the sister group of mesites while some more recent studies place this clade with another clade constituted of Columbiformes and Cuculiformes (cuckoos)."}

People who try to get HIV are called bugchasers, and they are all men who have sex with men. It is not entirely understood why people try to get HIV, and bugchasing actions are hard to understand. It is rare.\nMotivation and action.\nBugchasers are men who have sex with men and purposely try to get HIV. It is not understood why this happens. \nThere are four common explanations.\nFirst, it is thought that some men become bugchasers because they fear HIV infection, which had previously changed how they have sex. This can include things like men abstaining from sex entirely, only having sex with one person, or using sexual protection like condoms. Second, some men think having HIV is sexy. This means it can feel good to think about it, or that it is the ultimate taboo to overcome.\nThird, bugchasers might think having HIV makes them part of a group.\nAnd fourth, bugchasing might be an action against heteronormativity, the idea that everyone is heterosexual. The idea is that bugchasers do not achieve some expectations placed on them, including safe sex. There is a fifth possible reason\u2014suicide\u2014but this is not clear or very helpful.\nEither way, people only rarely call themselves bugchasers, and they only try to get HIV even more rarely. This behavior does not entirely fit in with their identity. This means that bugchasing actions are rarely based on persons known to have HIV and having sex with them. Instead, a lot of bugchasers have sex in ambiguous situations, where they do not know if their partners have HIV. In 2005, researchers said there was no empirical evidence that bugchasing existed; they said that bugchasing as an idea and an activity existed, but it was rare."}

As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels. In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV), which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as \"visual novels\" by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006. Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their extremely minimal gameplay. Typically the majority of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (most recent games offer \"play\" or \"fast-forward\" toggles that make even this unnecessary). Most visual novels have multiple storylines and many endings; the gameplay mechanic in these cases typically consists of intermittent multiple-choice decision points, where the player selects a direction in which to take the game.\nDevelopment.\nSimple 2000 Series Vol.122 - The Ningyo Hime Monogatari - Mermaid Prism is a japanese dating sim, this female-targeted love simulation puts players in the role of a high school student that one day gets warped to a separate world, becoming a mermaid along the way!

In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.\nTraditionally, this group has been allied with the cuckoos in the order Cuculiformes, but the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy raises this group to a full order Musophagiformes. They have been proposed to link the hoatzin to the other living birds, but this was later disputed. Recent genetic analyses have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes.\nMusophagidae is one of very few bird families endemic to Africa. Another order, which is also endemic to Africa are the mousebirds, Colliidae. All turaco species are frugivorous, but they also eat leaves, buds, and flowers. Figs are an important part of their diet. They have rounded wings and long tails and strong legs, making them poor fliers, but good runners.\nTuracos are medium-sized arboreal birds endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where they live in forests, woodland and savanna.\nThey are gregarious, non-migratory birds which move in family groups of up to 10. Many species are noisy, with the go-away-birds being especially noted for their piercing alarm calls, which alert other fauna to the presence of predators; their common name is onomatopoeia of this. Musophagids build large stick nests in trees, and lay twp or three eggs. The young are born with thick down and open, or nearly-open, eyes."}

Elia Suleiman's cinematic style is often compared to that of Jacques Tati and Buster Keaton, for its poetic interplay between \"burlesque and sobriety\". He is married to Lebanese singer and actress Yasmine Hamdan.\nLife and career.\nEarly work.\nBetween 1982 and 1993, Suleiman lived in New York City, where he co-directed: \"Introduction to the End of an Argument\" (1990) and directed \"Homage by Assassination\". Both won numerous awards.\nAn experimental video film, co-directed by Jayce Salloum, \"Introduction to the End of an Argument\" critiqued the portrayal of Arabs in Western media and its effect on foreign policy by juxtaposing clips from Hollywood films, television broadcasts and cartoons with live scenes (shot by Salloum) from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\"Homage by Assassination\" is a \"diary film\" that critiques the 1991 Gulf War via the juxtaposition of multilayered personal anecdotes and identity. The film offers a lucid portrait of what critics Ella Shohat and Robert Stam have termed \"cultural disembodiment,\" manifested in \"multiple failures of communication,\" that reflect the contradictions of a \"diasporic subject.\"\nPedagogical work.\nIn 1994, Suleiman moved to Jerusalem and began teaching at Birzeit University in the West Bank. He was given the task of developing a Film and Media Department at the university, with funding support from the European Commission. In 2008 Elia Suleiman became a professor at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee. He continues to guest lecture in other universities around the world.\nFeature films.\nIn 1996, Suleiman directed \"Chronicle of a Disappearance\", his first feature film. It won the Best First Film Prize at the 1996 Venice Film Festival.\nIn 2002, Suleiman's second feature film, \"Divine Intervention\", subtitled, \"A Chronicle of Love and Pain\", won the Jury Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and the International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI), also receiving the Best Foreign Film Prize at the European Awards in Rome.\nThe third film in his trilogy is called \"The Time That Remains\", which competed in the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Suleiman won the Black Pearl prize for best Middle Eastern narrative film at the Middle Eastern Film Festival in Abu Dhabi on October 17, 2009. The film won the Critics' Prize from the Argentinean Film Critics Association at Mar del Plata International Film Festival.\nHis latest film, \"It Must Be Heaven\", competed in the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and had its North American premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.\nOther film work.\nIn his 1998 film, \"The Arab Dream\" (\"Al Hilm Al-Arabi\") Suleiman autobiographically explores issues of identity, expressing that: \"I don't have a homeland to say I live in exile... I live in postmortem... daily life, daily death.\" Suleiman also produced a short film in 1997, entitled \"War and Peace in Vesoul\".\nIn 2000, Suleiman released the 15-minute short film \"Cyber Palestine\" which follows a modern-day Mary and Joseph as they attempt to cross from Gaza into Bethlehem. Suleiman was part of the nine-person jury for the 2006 Cannes Film Festival."}

It originated as a spin-off video game from the \"Rayman\" series, 2006's \"Rayman Raving Rabbids\", and is centered on a fictional species of mischievous rabbit-like creatures known as Rabbids, who speak gibberish and scream wildly whenever they experience an adrenaline rush. The series consists mainly of party video games, though other genres have been explored as well.\nDevelopment.\nThe earliest \"Rayman 4\" trailers depicted menacing rabbits, simply appearing from underground with a blank stare in various shapes and forms, smaller eyes and furry. At this point, trailers showed the game as an adventure game with fight stages, where Rayman would need to punch and kick himself kung fu style through a horde of zombie-bunnies. As the game concept evolved, from one of a central objective to minigames, a series of viral videos were created by Marketing Manager Adrian Lacey and Animator Charles Beirnaert which became incredibly successful on the new media platform YouTube. The rabbits slowly evolved into various merchandising products such as the Rabbid figures, which were much more conscious and amusing, changing from merely being enemies to fight through into more memorable characters with various traits and quirks. \"Rayman\" creator Michel Ancel described the bunnies as \"vicious, but at the same time [...] totally stupid\".\nIn a video interview, project lead Lo\u00efc Gounon confirmed the possibility of splitting the Rayman and Rabbid series apart, mentioning that the Rabbids \"managed to hit a bit more adult and a bit more older audience than the previous Raymans\". By 2009's \"Rabbids Go Home\", Rayman does not make an appearance; when asked about the omission of Rayman during an interview about \"Rabbids Go Home\", director Jacques Exertier provided an assurance that Rayman would return for more action-adventure video games.\nThe music style for the franchise was created by composer Mark Griskey. Mark worked with Audio Director Yoan Fanise to define the comedic style of the early games and the style was continued with the further versions of the franchise.\nCharacters.\nRabbids \u2013 Rabbids are wild rabbit-like creatures who like to cause havoc and mischief on Rayman's world (where they came from), the human world, and others and are gibberish speaking and yell \"BWAH!\" whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. They were originally the antagonists; however, due to increase in popularity, they became the protagonists in \"Rabbids Go Home\". A notable Rabbid who first appeared in \"Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle\" is Rabbid Peach.\nRayman \u2013 the main protagonist of the first three games. He always foils the Rabbids' evil plans. When the Rabbids became the protagonists of the franchise, Rayman was dropped, but continues to appear in his own games.\nProfessor Barranco III \u2013 the supreme leader of the Rabbids who planned out all of their invasions on Rayman's world, Earth and others. He is seen in the games \"Rayman Raving Rabbids 2\", \"Rabbids: Travel in Time\" and \"Rabbids: Alive and Kicking\" as the main antagonist (despite having a minor role in RRR 2 and RTiT). He is one of the rare smart Rabbids to exist, but can be easily fooled as well. In RAaK he has a Rabbid scientist as his second in command, who would later go on to become a major character in the TV series.\nSerguei \u2013 Serguei is the main villain of \"Rayman Raving Rabbids\". He is a large, black rabbid who abducted Rayman and the Globox kids and forced them to take part in the Rabbids Olympics filled with deadly challenges. In the end, Rayman manages to escape and free most of the Globox kids. It is unknown what happens to Serguei at that point, though his absence in further games suggest that he was relieved of his duties due to failure in keeping Rayman.\nThe Semi-Leaders \u2013 the Semi-leaders are fat, lazy and angry Rabbids who serve as the secondary antagonists of \"Rayman Raving Rabbids 2\". They constantly force the Rabbids to bring them food and don't do pretty much anything other than sitting or lying around and keeping things in check. They each have different themes in clothing.\nIn other media.\nOther video games.\nThe Rabbids have made several appearances in games outside of their own series or the Rayman franchise. In \"Red Steel\", the Rabbids appear as enemies in one of the game's later stages. The Wii version of ' includes three different types of Rabbids as playable characters, along with a stage based on \"Rabbids Go Home\". Toys of the Rabbids appear as hidden easter eggs in ' and \"Watch Dogs\". In \"\", a cheat can be used to turn the game's enemies into Rabbids. The song \"Here Comes the Hotstepper\" in \"Just Dance 2\" includes a Rabbid who attempts to dance with the choreographer. Similarly, the alternate version of the song \"Naughty Girl\" in the Nintendo Switch version of \"Just Dance 2018\" via \"Just Dance Unlimited\" subscription service includes Rabbid Peach from \"Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle\" as the main choreographer. \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" features three Rabbids from \"Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle\" as unlockable spirits and a Rabbid Mii Fighter hat was available as downloadable content on January 28, 2020. On April Fools' Day 2019, \"For Honor\" featured a limited time event in which Rabbids replaced all of the game's characters. In 2021, they have been featured in \"The Crew 2\" as their own LIVE Summit Event, as well as introducing two vanity cosmetic items into the game. The first is roofrack of a Rabbid hanging on to it and the second being a window tint full of Rabbids which can only be acquired by scoring platinum in the LIVE Summit.\nTV series.\nIn October 2010, Ubisoft and Aardman announced a partnership to produce a TV series pilot and several shorts based on the franchise. One year later, it was announced that 78 7-minute CG animated episodes would be made solely by Ubisoft Motion Pictures, and broadcast as 26 half-hour episodes by Nickelodeon on August 3, 2013.\nIn early 2012, Ubisoft Motion Pictures called on the French animation studio TeamTO to create most of the CGI parts of the series.\nOn E3 2013, it was announced that it would be an interactive Xbox One show entitled \"Rabbids Invasion\". The show aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from August 3, 2013 through June 23, 2017. On July 1, 2019, a fourth season was released on Netflix.\nFilm.\nA live-action/animated movie based on the franchise was in the works by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment. However, in 2019, Lionsgate and Ubisoft signed a deal to produce the Rabbids movie with Todd Strauss-Schulson in talks to direct the movie with Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman as producers. It is now being developed by Lionsgate, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, Mandeville Films, and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, with Matt Senreich, Tom Sheppard, and Zeb Wells set to write the film, while revised by Todd Rosenberg.\nComic book series.\nA comic book series based on the franchise has been released in France, Belgium and Switzerland. All comic strips are drawn by the French cartoonist Romaine Pujol and written by Thithaume. There are ten volumes thus far.\nMerchandising.\nAside from video games and the comic book series mentioned above, the Rabbids also have other merchandising such as T-shirts, figurines, plush toys, school equipment, fan club magazines, and for a limited time, a Happy Meal toy. A \"Raving Rabbids\" themed version of the card game \"Jungle Speed\" was also released in France.\nLicensing.\nThe Rabbids franchise has also been licensed for the out-of-home entertainment market such as the recent collaboration with arcade game manufacturer LAI Games to produce Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride, an attendant-free VR attraction.\nReception.\nThe \"Rabbids\" series, along with its titular characters, have become very popular. IGN has stated that the Rabbids have \"more personality and charisma than 10 of the most popular video game mascots combined\", and that the bunnies have literally \"upstaged Rayman himself\".\nGameSpot noted that the Rabbids themselves are \"almost exclusively responsible for [selling the game's humor], as they are, without a doubt, hysterical. They're adorably designed, with their dumb stares, high-pitched shrieks, and a penchant for taking comedic bumps.\""}

After the takeover of South Vietnam by the North Vietnamese communist government in April 1975, Australia, being a signatory to the \"Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees\", agreed to resettle its share of Vietnam-born refugees under a plan to resettle refugees between 1975 and 1985. After the early intake of refugees in the late 1970s, there was a second immigration wave in 1983\u201384, most likely a result of the 1982 agreement between the Australian and Vietnamese governments (the \"Orderly Departure Program\") which allowed relatives of Vietnamese Australians to leave Vietnam and move to Australia.

The earthquake caused serious damage to Lisbon. It killed an estimated 60,000 people in Lisbon alone. Violent shaking destroyed about 12,000 homes. Because November 1, when the quake struck, was All Saints' Day, many people were attending mass at the time of the quake. Churches collapsed and many people died.\nThe earthquake caused a tsunami that produced waves about 20 feet (6 metres) high in Lisbon. Shocks from the earthquake were felt throughout Europe. The disaster became an important event in European history."}

They make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese () and are the fourth-largest Asian American ethnic group after Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans. There are 2.2 million people of Vietnamese descent residing in the U.S.\nThe Vietnamese community in the United States was very small until the South Vietnamese immigration to the country after the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early immigrants were refugee boat people, loyal to South Vietnam in the conflict who left political persecution or wanted better jobs. More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, mostly in their large urban areas.\nSocioeconomics.\nIncome.\nIn 2019, the median household income for all Vietnamese Americans was $69,800, compared to $85,800 for all Asian Americans. Divided by birth, the income was $82,400 for US-born and $66,000 for Vietnamese-Americans born in other countries.\nEconomics.\nIn 2017, 10.6% of Vietnamese Americans lived under the poverty line, lower than the poverty rate for all Americans at 12.3%.\nEmployment.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reports in 2016 among working Vietnamese Americans (citizen employed population 16 years and over): 32.9% had management, business, science, and arts jobs; 30.9% had service jobs; 17.0% had office jobs, 4.3% had natural resources, construction, and maintenance jobs; and 15% had natural resources, construction, and maintenance jobs.\nThough Vietnamese immigration has continued at a fairly stable pace since the 1980s, the pathway to immigration for Vietnamese today has shifted entirely. As the opposite to the earlier history of Vietnamese migration that mostly came from refugees, an overwhelming majority of Vietnamese are now given LPR on the basis of family sponsored preferences or by way of close family to U.S. citizens, at 53% and 44% respectively.\nEducation.\nIn 2019, 55% of American born Vietnamese Americans had gotten a bachelor's degree or higher.\nEnglish proficiency.\nIn 2019, 90% of US-born Vietnamese Americans were able to speak English.\nView on schools.\nThe Vietnamese parents consider children's good school performance as a source of happiness for their family, encouraging their children to do well in school and to enter professional jobs as the way to get a better life. Vietnam's traditional Confucianist society values schools and learning, and many Vietnamese Americans have worked their way up from menial labor to have their second-generation children and go to college and become better. Compared to other Asian immigrant groups, Vietnamese Americans are more hopeful about their children's future; forty-eight percent believe that their children's standard of living will be better than theirs.\nStudent associations.\nA number of colleges have a Vietnamese Student Association, and an annual conference is hosted by the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations for current or future members."}

Some parts of the area, around Cross Flatts Park, suffer from high levels of poverty, while areas to the centre and south are generally considered richer. Beeston is home to the Leeds United football club stadium on Elland Road and Hunslet rugby league club.\nPlaces of worship.\nBeeston has at least ten churches of many religions including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Methodist and Baptist. The Anglican churches of St Mary on Town Street and St Luke on Malvern Road were made in the 1870s, though St Mary is on the site of a much older church. The more modern church of St David Waincliffe on Dewsbury Road, made in the 1960s was designed by Geoffrey Davy and won a Hoffman Wood (Leeds) Gold Medal for Architecture.\nThere are three mosques in Beeston, all located within the Beeston Hill area. There is also a Sikh Gurdwara.\nNotable people.\nThe person who wrote plays Willis Hall went to Cockburn High School in Beeston as did the academic and author of \"The Uses of Literacy\", Richard Hoggart. The poet Tony Harrison spent his childhood growing up in Tempest Road and went to what was then Cross Flatts county primary school.

This includes people born in the UK who are of Pakistani descent and Pakistani-born people who have went to the UK. Most of the British Pakistanis are originally from the Azad Kashmir and Punjab regions, with a smaller number from other parts of Pakistan including Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\nThe UK is home to the largest Pakistani community in Europe, with the amount of British Pakistanis living there exceeding 1.17 million based on the 2011 census. British Pakistanis are the second-largest racial minority population in the United Kingdom and also make up the second-largest sub-group of British Asians. They are also one of the largest overseas Pakistani communities, similar in number to people who have Pakistani heritage in Saudi Arabia.\nEarly history.\nDue to the historical relations between the two countries, going to the UK from the region which is now Pakistan started in small numbers in the mid-19th century. During the mid-19th century, parts of what is now Pakistan was ruled by the British Raj and people from those regions were soldiers in the British Indian Army and some were deployed in other parts of the British Empire. After the Second World War, the break-up of the British Empire and the independence of Pakistan, that Pakistani immigration to the United Kingdom went up, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. This was made easier as Pakistan was a member of the Commonwealth. Pakistani immigrants helped to sort out the job shortages in the British steel, textile and engineering industries. Doctors from Pakistan were recruited by the National Health Service in the 1960s.\nAmount.\nThe amount of British Pakistani people has grown from about 10,000 in 1951 to over 1.1 million in 2011. Most of the British Pakistanis live in England, with some in Scotland and smaller numbers in Wales and Northern Ireland. The most diverse group of Pakistani people is in London which comprises Punjabis, Mirpuri Kashmiris, Pashtuns, Sindhis, Muhajirs, Saraikis, Baloch and others.\nReligions.\nThe majority of British Pakistanis are Muslim; around 90 percent of those living in England and Wales at the time of the 2011 UK Census said their religion was Islam. The majority are Sunni Muslims, but there is also quite a big minority of Shia Muslims. The UK also has one of the largest overseas Christian Pakistani communities; the 2011 census recorded around 17,000 Christian Pakistanis living in England and Wales, 1.52 percent of the Pakistani people of England and Wales.\nSocial influence.\nSince their settlement, British Pakistanis have had many different contributions and influence on British society, politics, culture, economy and sport. Social issues include high relative poverty rates among the community according to the 2001 census, but some progress has been made in recent years, with the 2011 Census showing British Pakistanis as having amongst the highest levels of home ownership in Britain.\nTraditionally, many British Pakistanis have employed themselves, with many working in the transport industry or in family-run businesses of the retail sector."}

And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel.\" Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which \"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya\" \nTanweer's statements was clearer in making this link with British foreign policy than Mohammad Sidique Khan, the person thought to be the lead bomber. The video has also served to confirm thoughts that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in the Al-Qaeda organisation while in Dubai.\nLondon bombing.\nA few days before the bombing, Tanweer rented a red Nissan Micra from a local car-rental agency. His hair was also bleached due to the hydrogen peroxide he was using prior to the attack.\nOn 7 July, Tanweer, Khan, Hussain, and Lindsay are believed to have picked up the bombs from a house in the Leeds, hiding them in their rucksacks, then to have driven to Luton, Bedfordshire in the red Nissan, which he left parked in Luton railway station car park.\nIn Luton, the men went on the 07:23 Thameslink train, arriving at King's Cross in London at around 08.20 hours, where they went different ways and exploded their bombs.\nThe three London underground bombs exploded within 60 seconds of each other at 8:50\u00a0a.m.Tanweer travelled towards the east on the Circle line from Kings Cross, exploding his bomb on train number 204 between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, also killing at least seven people. The police found his body parts in the carriage he blew up.\nAfter the bombings, police found other bombs in Tanweer's car, which would be dealt with by an explosive police team."}

Anastasia was the daughter of the Roman emperor ConstantiusI, the half-sister of the emperor Constantine the Great, and the wife of Bassianus.\nAnastasia's mother was Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the wife of Constantius I. (It is also possible that Anastasia was the daughter of Helena, mother of Constantine I, and not a daughter of Maximiana Theodora.)\nAnastasia was written about by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus and the writer of the \"Anonymus Valesianus\", a Latin history. The \"Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae\" says that Roman baths in Constantinople (the Romans' capital city) had Anastasia's name. Anastasia's name () may mean that her father had sympathy for Christian or Jewish culture.\nThere is no evidence that any of Constantius's daughters married before their father died. Anastasia's sister Constantia may have been the first to marry, and may have been the oldest of the siblings. Constantia married in 313. Anastasia herself married Bassianus in 316 or in 314. At that time, Anastasia's half-brother Constantine was emperor. He planned to make Bassianus (a junior co-emperor). Anastasia's brother-in-law Licinius (Constantine's junior co-emperor) did not want this to happen, and Bassianus did not become . After this Constantine executed Bassianus. The \"Anonymus Valesianus\" says that Bassianus's execution was because Bassianus planned treason. What became of Anastasia is unknown. The encyclopaedia \"Brill's New Pauly\" says that Anastasia \"must have still been alive\" when Constantine built the city of Constantinople, because of the Roman baths there with her name ().\nIn the 5th century, the Greek historians of Socrates Scholasticus and Sozomen both wrote that the got their name from another Anastasia, a daughter of the emperor Valens.

Its plumage is mainly white, with black on the wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and are on average from beak tip to end of tail, with a wingspan. \nThe two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. \nThe white stork is a long-distance migrant. It winters in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.\nA carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. \nThough monogamous, the birds do not pair for life. Pairs build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female may lay a clutch of four eggs, which hatch roughly 33\u201334\u00a0days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs, and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58\u201364\u00a0days after hatching, and are fed by the parents for another 7\u201320\u00a0days."}

Smith was being pursued by a special U.S. Marshall's Service task force that apprehends wanted fugitives. The arrest operation had the participation of several local police agencies in the U.S. state of Minnesota, but was not assisted by the Minneapolis Police Department. Smith had been convicted previously of aggravated robbery and sentenced to a 48-month prison term, but was released on parole instead of serving more time in jail. He also had a felony conviction in Ramsey County for firearm possession and missed a May 19 sentencing hearing that could have resulted in prison time.\nIncident.\nIn the afternoon on June 3, after eating at a nearby restaurant, Smith was inside a stationary vehicle, along with a female passenger, and atop a parking ramp at West Lake Street and Girard Avenue South as law enforcement closed in to arrest him. According to the U.S. Marshall\u2019s Service in a statement they released soon after the incident, Smith \u201cfailed to comply and produced a handgun, resulting in task force members firing upon the subject\". Officers fired approximately a dozen rounds, striking Smith. Aid rendered at the scene was unsuccessful and Smith was pronounced dead. The female passenger was treated for injuries from flying glass. Though few details were known about the incident, rioting and looting broke out overnight from June 3 to 4 in the Uptown area of West Lake Street in Minneapolis.\nSmith was a local musician who went by the nickname Wince Me Boi. Years prior to the June 3 incident, he had boasted on social media posts that he would shoot police officers and not surrender, which drew controversy in the aftermath of the June 3 shooting. Smith had successfully fled in his car from Bloomington, Minnesota, police in who attempted to arrest him in 2020 on several warrants, and was facing a September 2021 hearing related to the high-speed chase from that incident.\nInvestigation.\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) began an investigation of the officer-involved shooting on June 3. The BCA said that they believed that Smith had fired a gun at the apprehending officers from inside his vehicle, and they said that authorities had recovered a handgun and spent ammunition cartridge from the driver's side of the vehicle he was driving. Officers from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and Ramsey County Sheriff's Officer were reportedly the ones who shot at Smith.\nLocal organization Communities United Against Police Brutality held a rally near the shooting site on June 4 to call for officials to release video footage and other details of the shooting. As it was a federal investigation, the U.S. Marshall's Services prohibited law enforcement authorities who responded from using body or squad cameras. During the afternoon, protesters briefly blocked the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and West Lake Street. Minneapolis police later reopened the intersection by removing objects that had been placed as barricades and slashing the tires of vehicles blocking the street that were later towed away. Family and friends of Smith held a peaceful vigil in the evening near where he was killed.\nProtests.\nCivil disorder resumed overnight from June 4 to 5 in the Uptown area of Minneapolis. Demonstrators returned to Lake Street area near Girard Avenue, and two dumpsters were lit on fire. Minneapolis police made several arrests in connection to late-night demonstrations."}

Meiro King\") is an action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2. It was developed and published in Japan by D3Publisher as part of the \"Simple 2000\" series, and in Europe by Midas Interactive Entertainment. It was released on March 12, 2004. Despite its reputation as a horrific racing game, there is little information about this game.\nStory &amp; plot.\nIt wasn't long ago that I proclaimed Minami no Shima ni Buta Ga Ita to be the worst game ever featured on this blog, but in Maze Action (Also known as The Simple 2000 Ultimate Series Vol. 8: Gekitou! Meiro King), I've found a fairly robust challenger to that title. It does fall short, though, in that while playing Maze Action is a completely miserable experience, and it's a pretty cheap-looking title, even for a Simple Series game, it does at least feel like it's just a bad game, and not a personal insult from the developers directed at the player. (Minami no Shima ni Buta Ga Ita really was that bad).\nGameplay.\nThe plot and the mechanics both seem to have been inspired by the popular comic Hunter X Hunter, specifically the hunter exam story arc. You are one of the four of this year's candidates to have reached the final exam at the hero academy, but there can only be one graduate, so you've got to face each other in a contest of skill and strength to determine who that'll be. So single player mode has four stages: you face off against each of the three characters you didn't pick, and then you fight a copy of your own character. It seems likely that there's probably a fifth stage with a final boss character, but you'd honestly need the patience of a saint to bother playing long enough to find out. The mechanical influence from HxH is also from the hunter exam part, as the contests in which you're place see you running around a maze, trying to be first to find three matching keys and getting to your opponent's starting pad. The twist is that while you need three red keys and your opponent needs three blue, you start with a blue key and they start with a red. So, just like that part on the island where all the hunter candidates have to run around trying to steal each other's number badges, while protecting their own, you will be forced, at some point, to fight your opponent. There are various items littering the mazes, along with the keys. There's weapons, of both melee and projectile varieties, and there's traps. There's also some traps permanently planted around the place, too. This could have all addedup into a fairly decent game, but the problem is all in the execution. Moving around feels awkward, combat is haphazard and unsatisfying, and it just generally doesn't feel very good to play. It's frustrating, because it also feels like the developers were really inspired and really wanted to make a simplified videogame version of the hunter exam, but they just didn't make it enjoyable to play. So yeah, Maze Action is a terrible game and you definitely shouldn't play it. But I can see what they were trying to do, at least. That's something, right?\nReference.\nhttps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/917274-maze-action\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Agetec-Maze-Action-PS2/dp/B000197Z6C\nhttp://lunaticobscurity.blogspot.com/2016/12/maze-action-ps2.html\nhttps://www.mobygames.com/game/maze-action\nhttps://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Maze-Action-PS2-PlayStation-2-Video-Game-Original-UK-Release-/254548926471"}

Usually, this information is stored in one or two lines, which encode some of the information in machine readable form. The information is then extracted using optical character recognition. Usually, this is the given names, family name, date of birth, sex, and validity of the travel document. Machine-readable passports (or machine-readable travel documents) have been used since the 1980s. Today, most passports, and travel documents are machine readable. \nNewer machine-readable passports also store some extra information (such as biometrical data, like a fingerprint) on a microchip. \nThe basic idea behind the introduction of machine-readable travel documents was to speed up passport control at the borders."}

The events happened in Marikana, a place in South Africa. South African police forces shot at miners, who were protesting. They injured 78 and killed 34 of them. Most of those killed were killed by rifles used by police forces. The event was the most lethal use of force by South African security forces against civilians since 1976. The massacre has been compared to the 1960 Sharpeville massacre. \nThe strike was considered a important event in modern South African history; similar strikes at took place at other mines across South Africa. These events made 2012 the most protest-filled year in the country since the end of apartheid.\nThe Marikana massacre occurred during a wildcat strike at a mine owned by Lonmin in the Marikana area, close to Rustenburg, in 2012. The event garnered international attention after a series of violent incidents between the police, Lonmin security, and members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on one side, and strikers on the other. The first incidents of violence were on 11 August, when NUM leaders opened fire on NUM members who were on strike. Two strikers were seriously wounded, but not killed, in the shooting by NUM members.\nDuring the period from Sunday 12 August to Tuesday 14 August, 10 people were killed, including six mine workers, two Lonmin security guards, and two SAPS members. Three of the mine workers, and the two SAPS members, were killed in a clash between strikers and SAPS members on the afternoon of 13 August. The remaining five people are known to or believed to have been killed by strikers."}

She is seen by the audience trying to get a customer from a busy downtown street. Liz tells the audience of her life and problems while the movie is airing. When a van stops by, Liz refuses to get in. That's because she was gang raped by several men the last time she got in a van. A passerby wanted to take Liz to the hospital.

He is violent, well-dressed and controlling.\nWhen Liz stops off at a strip club, she talks about how she got involved in prostitution to begin with. She was a small town girl. She married a violent and drunk man named Charlie. Liz later had a son with him. She couldn't deal with him anymore. She left Charlie. She began working at a local diner.\nLater, Liz met the pimp Blake. At first, Blake did some things for Liz. However, Blake has become as cruel and violent as Liz' husband. She decides to get away from Blake.\nA local homeless man and street performer named Rasta takes Liz to a movie. Rasta is scary at first (he walks on broken glass for an act). But then Liz agrees. The scenes with Liz and Rasta at the movie alternate with Blake explaining his own life.\nAfter the movie, Liz tells the audience of her son. Her son is under foster care. She finally has a customer.

It is a television program about African penguins. It is set in Simon's Town, South Africa. It is set from late 2019 through mid-2020. It aired on Netflix on June 16, 2021.\nPatton Oswalt is the narrator of \"Penguin Town\". He tells the viewer what is happening. He is also an executive producer. The other executive producers are Brian Armstrong, Shannon Malone-Debenedictis, and Belinda Cherrington.\nStyle.\nIn some ways, \"Penguin Town\" is like other nature shows. A narrator tells the viewer what is happening while video of penguins plays. In other ways, \"Penguin Town\" is like reality television. The narrator talks about penguins as if they were human contestants on a reality TV show. For example, he says \"his wife\" and \"her husband\" instead of \"his mate\" or \"her mate.\" The narrator names most penguins after where they decide to build nests. The pair that build a nest in a bougainvillea bush are called Mr. and Mrs. Bougainvillea. He calls the two who build a nest in a family's back garden Lord and Lady Courtyard. The opening credits label Mr. and Mrs. Bougainvillea as \"the soulmates,\" Mr. and Mrs. Culvert as \"the newlyweds,\" and a Cape fur seal \"the scoundrel.\" The credits also read \"Six hot months,\" \"One wild colony,\" \"No rules\" like on a reality TV show. Often, cheerful music plays.\nMaking.\nThe camera crew from Red Rock Films started out following 80 pairs of penguins. They later followed only 50 penguins. Then the team chose a smaller group of penguins to make the story. The camera crew used tripods, waterproof cameras, drones, other special cameras, and even an antigravity platform.\nPlace.\n\"Penguin Town\" takes place in a human town full of people. The penguins walk past cars, streets, houses, and human beings to go to and from the sea and their nests. The camera does not usually show any human being's face. The narrator says \"giants\" instead of \"humans.\" On \"Penguin Town\", humans from SANCCOB take injured penguins to veterinarians. They also take lost eggs to raise in incubators.\nThe narrator says that the penguins build nests near humans because they know no other dangerous animals will come near them.\nIn the last episodes, the camera shows a beach with no people on it, and a lost medical mask to show that this is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. A caracal comes into the town to hunt penguins while the humans are in their houses.\nCharacters.\nMr. and Mrs. Bougainvillea are called \"the soulmates\" early on the show. After Mrs. Bougainvillea does not come back from fishing, Mr. Bougainvillea is called \"the single dad.\" They are about 12 years old and have been raising chicks together for seven years. Their two chicks are called Twig and Petal.\nThe Car Park Gang are called \"the bullies.\" They are penguins without mates or nests. They attack other penguins, including chicks.\nMr. and Mrs. Culvert are called \"the newlyweds.\" They are raising a chick for the first time. They build a nest in a culvert, and both their eggs are washed away by the rain. Human beings save one egg and take it away for experts to raise.\nJunior is called \"the misfit.\" He is a two-year-old penguin. He is bitten by a seal and the bites become infected. Human beings take him from the beach to a veterinary clinic and bring him back after he is healed.\nLord and Lady Courtyard start building a nest later than most penguins.\nMr. and Mrs. Wheelbarrow raise four chicks, two at a time.\nEpisodes.\nAll of the first season aired at the same time on June 16, 2021:\n1. Homecoming\n2. The Nest Generation\n3. Hot and Bothered\n4. Lost and Found\n5. Close Encounters\n6. Weekend Warriors\n7. Beyond the Nest\n8. Learning to Fly\nResponse.\nDorothy Rabinowitz of \"The Wall Street Journal\" called \"Penguin Town\" \"enchanting.\" Romey Norton of \"Ready Steady Cut\" called \"Penguin Town\" \"humorous and insightful\" and said the fact that it was not as serious as other penguin TV shows made it feel fresh. Joel Keller of \"The Decider\" said the show was sometimes \"corny,\" meaning silly, but he also liked that it was not too serious and told its story well. He also says that most nature shows about penguins do not usually show them in warm places like Simon's Town or near people.\nStuart Heritage of \"The Guardian\" said the penguins had been \"anthropomorphized to high heaven,\" meaning that they were spoken of as if they were human beings. He said it was good comfort food to watch during the pandemic because every time something bad happened to a penguin on the show, something good happened right after that."}

{"id": "850380", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=850380", "title": "Sent\u014d", "text": "Sent\u014d are Japanese public bathhouses. People take baths together there. Many Japanese people think of sent\u014d as an important part of Japanese culture, with its manners and ideas about communities. \nSent\u014d are not the same as onsen. Onsen are baths built on natural hot springs. Onsen water has minerals in it. Sent\u014d water is either tap water or well water. Some sent\u014d may add good-smelling plants or bath salts to the water. Sent\u014d cost less than onsen to visit.\nToday, sent\u014d are not as popular as they once were. This is because people have bathtubs and showers in their homes. They do not need to go to a sent\u014d to clean. Many people still go to sent\u014d, but they go to enjoy the water and relax. The Tokyo Sent\u014d Association makes sure going to a sent\u014d does not become expensive because they want people to be able to go to sent\u014d. Going to a sent\u014d costs about \u00a5 340 to \u00a5470 (US$3-4.25). The local government decides the price.\nArchitecture.\nOn the outside, a sent\u014d looks like a temple. The entrance has a Japanese curtain called \"noren\". Noren are usually blue. Most sent\u014d have concrete or steel chimneys for the boilers that heat the water. Sometimes, a person can find a neighborhood's sent\u014d by looking for a building with this kind of special chimney.\nThe dressing area is usually made in the traditional Japanese style, with wood and dark colors. The bathing area are usually made with tiles and is full of light. Japanese people think of this style as Western.\nSent\u014d have separate places for men and women, but young children can go to either side. Babies often go with the women. Fathers take boys and very young girls to the men's side. Sometimes there is a door between the men's and women's sides. Children are allowed to go through the door.\nMany sent\u014d have a large mural, or wall painting, near the tubs. Many are landscapes or pictures of Mount Fuji. The water in the air is bad for the paint, so the murals wear out. Repainting a mural in the one day a week that a sent\u014d is closed is hard to do, so some sent\u014d use tiled mosaics or a window that looks out on a garden for decoration instead.\nSome sent\u014d owners and their families live in rooms at the back of the building.\nHistory.\nPeople built the first sent\u014d during the Nara period, in the 700s. The first people to use sent\u014d were monks. They used the sent\u014d for ritual purification. Later, more sent\u014d were built for ordinary people to go and get clean. By 1700, most of the neighborhoods in Tokyo, then called Edo, had their own bathhouse. Many of the sent\u014d of that time were steam baths, not soaking baths. They did not have windows, so the bathers could not see very well. Sometimes the water was dark and dirty.\nIn 1868, the Meiji Restoration took away some of the class system of Japan. After that, many former nobles or samurai took baths with the regular people in sent\u014d.\nTsurusawa Monzaemon had the idea for modern sent\u014d in 1878. Instead of a steam bath, he built a big tub that the bather could sit down in. He put windows in his sent\u014d so there would be light to see by. This made it easier to see whether the water was clean. People liked these new sent\u014d and soon built many more of them. In 1885, the government said no one could build the old, dark sent\u014d any more. All new sent\u014d had to be light so they could be kept clean. They also passed a law against men and women bathing together, but no one cared about it until after many foreigners began to visit Japan later in the Meiji period (late 1800s).\nIn the 20th century, sent\u014d became less popular. To keep customers, sent\u014d owners put in bubblers, exercise equipment, saunas, electric shocks and other things bathers could not get at home. In 1972, there were about 21,200 sent\u014d in Japan. This went down to 13,250 in 1985.\nAccording to the Tokyo Sento Association, there were about 530 sent\u014d in Tokyo in 2020.\nSuper sent\u014d.\nPeople began building super sent\u014d in the second half of the 20th century. Super sent\u014d have more things to do than regular sent\u014d. Some have water slides, swimming pools, or restaurants. Super sent\u014d are meant to be fun instead of relaxing. Sometimes people wear bathing suits at super sent\u014d instead of being naked.\nManners.\nBefore entering, visitors take off their shoes and put them in shoe lockers. At sent\u014d in Japan today, it is not good manners to clean one's body in the bathtub. Bathers must shower before getting in the water. This keeps dirt, sweat and other things from making the water dirty. Many sent\u014d provide soap and towels. Bathers sit on a stool in the shower. The bathers must not wear any clothes or swimsuits in the sent\u014d. Bathers may use towels at the sent\u014d or bring their own, but the towel must not go in the water. Bathers put the towels on their heads instead. People with long hair tie it up so it does not get in the water. People are not supposed to have tattoos. This is because, in Japan, people think of the Yakuza criminals when they see tattoos. Men and women do not get in the same tubs today, but hundreds of years ago, they did.\nCulture.\nParents would take their children to sent\u014d to learn good manners, such as how to greet people, how to bathe without splashing, and general ideas about Japanese culture.\nGoing to a sent\u014d is part of the idea \"hadaka no tsukiai\", spending time together naked. It is also called or \"skinship,\" written \"sukinshippu\" in Japanese. Families, housewives from the same neighborhood, businessmen or classmates use the sent\u014d as a place to spend time together naked, which makes them feel like a group.\nThe Japanese people enjoy bathing in hot and cold water so much that it is in the language: The Japanese word \"yumizu\" means \"hot and cold water\" but it is also an expression meaning \"plenty of everything.\""}

Items baked with almond flour are usually calorie-heavy.\nAlmonds are high in polyunsaturated fats. The omega 6 fatty acids in almonds are protected from oxidation by the skin and vitamin E. When almonds are ground, this protective skin is broken and exposed surface area increases dramatically, greatly making it more likely for the nut to oxidize."}

One of the trumpets is made of sterling silver and the other is made of bronze or copper. Both trumpets are seen as the oldest working trumpets in he world. They are also the only trumpets known from ancient Egypt.\nWhen he excavated Tutankhamun's tomb, Howard Carter found the trumpets. The bronze trumpet was found in a large chest, that contained various military objects and walking sticks. The chest was in the antechamber of the tomb. The silver trumpet was found in the burial chamber. Both trumpets are engraved, they show images of gods Ra-Horakhty, Ptah and Amun. The silver trumpet's bell is engraved with many sepals and calices representing a lotus flower, and the praenomen and nomen of the king. The bronze trumpet may in fact be made of copper; the metal has not yet been analysed. Similar looking trumpets feature in Egyptian wall-paintings that are usually, though not always, associated with military scenes.\nAfter they had been silent for more than 3.000 years, the trumpets where used before an audience of about 150 million listeners through an international BBC broadcast aired on 16 April 1939. James Tappern of Prince Albert's Own 11th Royal Hussars regiment played the trumpets. The recording was recently featured, and can be heard on the BBC Radio 4 program \"Ghost Music\". Rex Keating, who presented the 1939 broadcast, later claimed that during a rehearsal, the silver trumpet shattered, and Alfred Lucas, a member of Carter's team who had restored the finds, was so distressed he needed to go to hospital. Due to their fragility, it is unlikely the trumpets will be played again in any official musical reconstructions.\nDimensions, manufacture and performance.\nThe silver trumpet has a length of , the bronze/copper trumpet is about shorter. Their tubes are around in diameter at the mouth end, increasing to about before flaring out to at the extremity. The mouth-ends are strengthened by rings and are large by modern standards \u2013 which would have made the trumpets hard to play; Tappern needed to add a modern mouthpiece (with packing to make it fit) before his performance.\nJeremy Montagu examined the broze trumpet in the 1970s. It consists of two sections. The slightly conical body is from a rolled sheet of copper alloy between 0.2 and 0.25\u00a0mm thick. It has been soldered lengthways with a \"very skilfully brazed meander joint ... smoothed to a perfect finish\", yet is \"slightly rough\" internally, indicating that (as might be expected in a ceremonial instrument) appearance was of greater value than acoustic performance. The bell is of a different, thinner material: an electrum-like alloy of gold, between 0.1 and 0.13\u00a0mm thick. It is without a visible seam, probably \"burnished until the gold simply flowed together\". The 3.25\u00a0mm thick ring that forms the mouthpiece was probably also made of electrum. The ring is apparently not fixed to the body, Montagu suspected that although it was possible to generate three notes on the instrument, the highest note would not have been sounded; besides being an effort to produce, the trumpet's construction could not have tolerated it. The lowest note does not carry far, leading Montagu to hypothesize that only the middle note was used in a rhythmic signaling code.\nClaims of magical powers.\nThe bronze trumpet was among items stolen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo during the Egyptian looting and riots of 2011, mysteriously returned to the museum some weeks later. According to \"Al-Ahram\", after its return Hala Hassan, curator of the Tutankhamun collection at the Egyptian Museum, claimed that it had \"magical powers\" and that \"whenever someone blows into it a war occurs. A week before the revolution, during a documenting and photographing process, one of the museum's staff had blown into it and a week after revolution broke out. The same thing had happened before the 1967 war and prior to the 1991 gulf war, when a student was doing a comprehensive research on Tutankhamun's collection.\""}
