The words \"white supremacy\" are sometimes used to describe a political idea that shows the social and political dominance of whites.\nWhite supremacy is a form of racism. However it is not to be confused with different political and moral differences that people of any race may hold. White supremacists also want racial separation, which means people of different races living apart. White supremacy has often resulted in anti-black racism and antisemitism (Anti-Jewish hate).\nThe different groups who are in favour of white supremacy do not agree on who is white, or on which group is their worst enemy. White supremacists often consider Jews to be the biggest threat to their cause, because they think Jews are able to mix much more easily than other ethnic groups.\nHistory.\nPolitically, socially and economically, white supremacy was common in the United States before the American Civil War and for decades after. The same is true of white supremacist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia and of parts of Europe at different time periods; importantly under Nazi Germany's Third Reich. The size of White supremacy's influence on Western culture, and the way in which it influences society, is still being debated. In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white could not vote and were not allowed to be part of the government. They were also not allowed to hold most government jobs \u2014 well into the second half of the 20th century. White leaders often thought of Native Americans and Australian Aborigines as stopping society from going forward, rather than as settlers in their own right. Many European-settled countries at the Pacific Ocean limited immigration from Asian and Pacific countries. Many U.S. states banned marriage between races, through \"anti-miscegenation laws\" until 1967, when these laws were changed. South Africa and Rhodesia kept its white supremacist dicatorships until 1994 and 1980, respectively.\nWhite supremacists have become linked with a racist part of the skinhead subculture, though when the skinhead scene first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by Jamaican rude boys and British mods. By the 1980s, \na large white power skinhead faction had formed.\nWhite supremacist movements and ideas.\nWhite supremacist groups can be found in most countries and regions with a large white population, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Latin America. In all of these areas, their views represent a small amount of the population, and the amount of people who are active in the groups is quite small. The militant approach taken by white supremacist groups has caused them to be watched closely by law enforcement officials. Some European countries have laws against hate speech, as well as other laws that ban or limit some white supremacist organizations (but not all).\nReligious movements.\nThe Christian Identity movement, which is regarded by most other Christians as heretical is closely tied to white supremacy. Although the Ku Klux Klan's reasons for supporting racial segregation are not mainly based on religious ideals, some Klan groups are openly Christian Protestant because of their northern European/Germanic roots.\nSome white supremacists say that they follow the Odinist religion, although most Odinists reject white supremacy, and white supremacists make up only a small part of those who support Odinism (belief in the gods of Norse mythology). Some white supremacist groups, such as the South African Boeremag, put elements of Christianity and Odinism together.\nThe World Church of the Creator, now called the Creativity Movement promotes a federally-recognized racial religious creed called Creativity. The basic ideology is based on the idea of a sound mind in a sound body in a sound society in a sound environment. The religion is dedicated to the \"survival, expansion and advancement of the white race\" and \"building a whiter and brighter world.\" Central to this is a unique \"holy war\" referred to as \"RAHOWA\" is which members of the white race must take steps to preserve their white race. They believe that all races are at enmity with each other for territory and natural resources and their war is a religious war. They are not Christian and essentially atheistic agnostic."}

In the 19th century, the planet was thought to orbit close to the sun. Its gravitational pull would explain changes seen between the perihelion advance of Mercury from that predicted by Classical Mechanics. The theory that Vulcan exists come from the earlier prediction that an outer planet (now Neptune) was causing similar changes in the orbit of Uranus from the orbit predicted by classical theory.\nNone of the searches for Vulcan found a planet. This caused some people to not agree with Newtonian theory. It led to the development of Special Relativity and General Relativity. Albert Einstein's modified theory of gravity showed why the orbit of Mercury changes without the existence of Vulcan. This disproved the theories of Vulcan."}

Another flag was chosen as a land flag, it was a simple white cross on a blue field. A third flag was adopted for the merchant fleet (a flag to be used by civilians on ships only), but it was only used for 8 years.

She was interested in sculpture, and was a notable architect. In 1871, she married John, Marquess of Lorne (Duke of Argyll from 1900), but the marriage was unhappy. They made up with each other in the 1900s, and after Argyll's death in 1914, she had a nervous breakdown. She died in 1939 at the age of 91.\nEarly life.\nLouise was born at Buckingham Palace, the main British royal home in London. Her mother was Queen Victoria, and her father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Louise spent much of her early life moving between the different royal homes that her parents stayed in. These included Buckingham Palace; Osborne House on the Isle of Wight; Windsor Castle in Berkshire; and Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\nLouise's education was similar to her brothers and sisters. She was given a basic education, as well as tasks such as cookery, carpentry and farming. She was good at art, especially sculpture. Hallam Tennyson, son of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, wrote that Louise could \"draw beautifully\". She was also good at acting and dancing. The Queen wrote that Louise \"danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters\". She wanted to know about a lot of things, which gave her the nickname \"Little Miss Why\" from members of the royal family.\nDeath of Prince Albert.\nLouise's father, Prince Albert, became ill with typhoid fever, and died on 14 December 1861. Queen Victoria was very sad after this happened, as she and Albert were a loving couple. While the Queen mourned, the court became morbid, and Louise quickly became fed up with it. On her 17th birthday, she asked if the ballroom could be opened for a dance, but Queen Victoria refused. Louise's irritation, in turn, irritated the Queen, who did not like Louise's arguments.\nThe Queen never really got over Albert's death, but she made herself feel better by sticking to Albert's plans for her children's marriages. In 1862, Louise's sister, Princess Alice, married Prince Louis of Hesse; in 1863, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales married Princess Alexandra of Denmark; and in 1866, Princess Helena married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. With Louise's elder sisters now married, Louise was left to be the Queen's helper. Despite not being happy about it, the Queen agreed with this, and was surprised by the results. The Queen wrote: \"She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.\" In her new role, Louise was less bored by the court, because she had more things to do."}

It is triangular, surrounded by three mountain ranges. It extends over eight Indian states (principally, Telangana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu).\nThe plateau covers , 27.7 percent of India's landmass.\nThe uplands, areas of higher landmass, form a triangle that is nested in the familiar downward-pointing triangle of the Indian sub-continent's coastline. In the south of India, the plateau is largely over above sea level. In the north it is mostly about above sea level. \nThe plateau is extremely large, and there are many habitats: different ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains.\nOn the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges rise from their nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India. The mountains make the southward-pointing vertex of a triangle. The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range. These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India.\nOrigin of name.\nThe name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word \"dakkhin\", which comes from the Sanskrit word \"dak\u1e63i\u1e47a-\" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.\nThe Deccan Traps.\nThe Deccan Traps are a main cause of the special geography and geology of South India. They are a large igneous province on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India (between 17\u201324N, 73\u201374E) and one of the largest volcanic features on the planet. They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that are more than thick and cover an area of . The term 'trap', used in geology for such rock formations, is derived from the Dutch word for stairs, referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.\nHistory.\nThe Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats (near present-day Mumbai) some 66\u00a0million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted fewer than 30,000\u00a0years in total. The gases released in the process may have played a role in the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. The consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in Central America but that the Deccan eruptions also disrupted the planet's climate.\nBefore the Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics, it is estimated that the original area covered by the lava flows was as large as 1.5\u00a0million km\u00b2, about half the size of modern India. The present area of directly observable lava flows is estimated to be around .\nThe release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change. Data point to an average fall in temperature of 2\u00a0\u00b0C (3.6\u00a0\u00b0F) during this period."}

It can be used as a weapon against an enemy soldier or vehicle. The most common type of grenade is the fragmentation grenade. Fragmentation grenades send out lots of very fast, very small fragments when they explode. Hand granades are usually thrown, and explode soon after that. Some specially designed grenades are fired from rifles or specially made grenade launchers. There are grenades which contain tear gas. These are used to control riots.\nHand grenades are used by the infantry. There are three main types: one which gives a big powerful blast to destroy bunkers, another which starts fires and another which contains shrapnel to hurt enemy soldiers. Most grenades are shaped like an egg, with a metal-arm on its top and a ring. When the ring is pulled out, the arm flips up and ignites a fuse. The user then has a few seconds to throw it and take cover, usually about 5 seconds. It explodes on impact and may injure or even kill people.\nHistory.\nEarly grenades were iron balls, filled with gunpowder and with a long fuse that its user must light up with a match before throwing. Some were too big to throw, so soldiers rolled them. Some armies assigned special soldiers called \"grenadiers\" to throw or roll grenades. \nGrenades in the early 20th century exploded on contact. This was changed during World War I to time fuses. The German army used stick grenades (grenades with handles) during World War I and World War II. The Soviet Army used different grenades for attack and defence."}

It can change what a person thinks, does, feels, and sense of well-being. It may lead to being sad, make it harder to think and a large change in appetite and time spent sleeping. People who have depression may feel no hope and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. It can either be short term or long term. The main symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which means losing of interest in things that usually make people happy. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia; it is a normal reaction to life events, such as losing a loved one; and it is also caused by some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments."}

Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his \u201cdiscoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses.\u201d\nMethod.\nHershey and Chase used T2 phage, a bacteriophage. The phage infects a bacterium by attaching to it and injecting its genetic material into it. \nThey labeled the phage DNA with radioactive Phosphorus-32. They then followed the phages while they infected E. coli. They found that the radioactive element left on the phage's DNA was only in the bacterium, and not in the phage, meaning that the DNA had entered the bacterium.\nIn a second experiment, Hershey and Chase put labels on the phage protein with radioactive Sulfur-35. After the phage was attached to the bacterium, the radioactive element was found in the phage, but not in the bacterium. This means that the phage's proteins stayed on the outside of the bacterium. These results showed Hershey and Chase that the genetic material that infects the bacteria is DNA."}

The most well-known genus is \"Myrmeleo\". There are about 2,000 species.\nDescription.\nMost people know this insect because of the funnel-shaped pit, up to 2 inches in diameter and depth, produced by the larval stages of this insect to trap ants. Larvae have globular abdomens and narrower, flattened heads bearing sickle-shaped jaws. Adults superficially resemble drab-colored, 1 \u00bd inch long damselflies with four long, narrow, net-veined wings roof-like held over a long, skinny abdomen when at rest. Unlike damselflies, however, ant-lion antennae are prominent and clubbed at the end.\nDigestion\nAntlions burrow in the ground, forming a pit for prey to fall into. The pit is angled so that the sides of the pit crumble when the victim tries to climb out. After being swallowed by the antlion, the victim is kept alive and slowly digested over 1,000 years, where they will fund a new definition of pain and suffering. The prey is restrained by tentacles in the stomach to prevent it from escaping. "}

He is most well known for the songs \"American Pie\" and \"Vincent\".\nIn his early career, Don McLean mainly played folk music. He sang folk songs and played simple chords with acoustic guitar and harmonica. In 1969, Don Mclean joined folk singer Pete Seeger in the environment campaign. They gave talks and playing concerts to help people know some of the problems with the environment. Also in the same year, Don McLean released his first album \"Tapestry\". This album was not very successful. McLean continued to perform in many small places.\nIn 1971, Don Mclean released an eight minute long song named \"American Pie\". The song was dedicated to Don McLean\u2019s music hero Buddy Holly. Much of the song was about the deaths of Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) in 1959. It also dealt with many important events in American history. Quickly \"American Pie\" became the number 1 song in the United States. Don McLean became a superstar and drew many audiences to his concerts. In 2005, American Pie was voted 5th in the \"365 songs of the century\" list. His second single \"Vincent\", featuring Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece \"Starry Night\", also topped the UK and US charts in 1971. The song is played in Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam every day.\nIn the later 1970s, Don McLean tried other styles of songs. He was not as popular with these other styles. Bad sales of albums caused him to change recording companies from one to another. Finally, in 1980, Don McLean regained his popularity by playing \"Crying\", a song first sang by Roy Orbison. The song reached the first place in UK chart. \nDon McLean is not as popular today as he was before. He is still writing and singing his own songs and performing in concerts.\nThe famous guitar player, Eric Clapton, spoke highly of Don McLean\u2019s guitar playing skill after listening to his guitar performance. Also, Don McLean\u2019s performance on stage once inspired Lori Lieberman to write the 1974 Grammy-winning song \"Killing me softly with his song\". Most of the successive folk singers entitled him with \"US legend\""}

{"id": "143838", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143838", "title": "Diacritic", "text": "A diacritic is a mark put above, below, through or on a letter. Examples ar an acute accent or a grave accent. The word comes from the Greek word \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (transl. diakritik\u00f3s = 'distinguishing').\nUsually, it affects the way the word is said (pronounced). Most diacritics concern pronunciation because most alphabets do not describe the sounds of words exactly. Diacritics are rare in English, but common in many other languages.\nExamples.\nEnglish.\nEnglish orthography often uses digraphs (like \"ph\", \"sh\", \"oo\", and \"ea\") rather than diacritics to show more sounds than can be shown with single letters of the Latin alphabet. Unlike other systems (such as Spanish) where the spelling shows how to say the words, English pronunciation is so varied that diacritics alone would not make it phonetic. By using digraphs we show sounds which are not shown by single letters.\nDiacritics are not used much in modern English. Two types of diacritics have become part of everyday English: the dot above the \"i\" or \"j\" and the apostrophe. But they are no longer commonly thought of as being diacritical. The apostrophe is used to show missing letters (elision, \"it's\" to replace \"it is\") and show possession (as in \"Mike's car\").\nIn most other cases, use of diacritics for native English words is considered old-fashioned (not used anymore). Diaereses (similar to umlauts) can be used on words where two vowels next to each other are pronounced separately like \"no\u00f6ne\", \"re\u00ebstablished\", or \"co\u00f6perate\" (two vowels pronounced \"together\" are a diphthong). This method is still used sometimes. Diacritics are sometimes used in loanwords (words of foreign origin), such as \"na\u00efve\", \"entr\u00e9e\", \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\", \"fa\u00e7ade,\" which are French words.\nFrench.\nLetter e: common are the acute accent \u00e9 (rising voice, as in the French word n\u00e9e), grave accent \u00e8 (lowering voice); \"\u00e9l\u00e8ve\" has (from the left) acute, grave and silent e. The cedilla \u00e7 denotes a soft c. \nA different principle is illustrated by the circumflex \u00ee. This usually shows the loss of letter: e.g. maistre (Middle French) &gt; ma\u00eetre (modern French). Thus its function is historical. Also, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between homophones. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: \"sur\" = on, but \"s\u00fbr\" = safe. In those cases the pronunciation of the two words may be different.\nSpanish.\nIn Spanish the acute accent simply signals stress, e.g. \"educaci\u00f3n\". There the stress is on the last vowel, not on the usual second to last. Second to last vowel (syllable) is the usual position for stress in spoken Spanish. It is usually not signalled by a printed accent. Where the stress is in its usual place, the end consonant is often dropped in speech.\nThe tilde \u00f1 is pronounced something like ny. It counts as a separate letter in their dictionaries, coming after n.\nThe double L is pronounced as our Y and LL is in Spanish dictionaries in its own section, after the single L section.\nGerman.\nThe umlaut \u00fc in German is pronounced ue, and is less used in modern German. Historical name-spellings should always keep the umlaut if it was used for that name.\nSwedish, Norwegian, Danish.\nThe Scandinavian languages treat the characters with diacritics \u00e4, \u00f6 and \u00e5 as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after z. Usually \u00e4 is sorted as equal to \u00e6 (ash) and \u00f6 is sorted as equal to \u00f8 (o-slash). Also, aa, when used as an alternative spelling to \u00e5, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that \u00fc is frequently sorted as y.\nNon-Roman scripts.\nScripts for semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew have a wide variety of diacritics. This is partly because the scripts for semitic languages were originally formed without separate letters for vowels, and partly because some of the languages (Arabic in particular) are spoken in a number of dialects. \nThe diacritics in Hebrew and Arabic are not always used, however."}

The reason is that Singapore has a multi-ethnic society. The Singapore government recognises four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Due to the Singapore's history, the symbolic national language is Malay. The local patois spoken on the streets is a creole called Singlish amongst the locals. It is known by academics as 'Singapore Colloquial English'.\nWorking language.\nEnglish was introduced to Singapore by the British in 1819. The British established a port, later a colony, on the island. English had been the administrative language of the colonial government, and when Singapore gained self-government in 1959 and independence in 1965, the local government decided to keep English as the working language. It is not against the law to speak mother tongue during working hours. It is against the law to forbid people speaking their mother tongue anywhere at work as long as it does not harm the business and/or compromise safety at work.\nThe use of English as a common language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore.\nBilingualism.\nIn schools, students are also required to take a Mother Tongue class, where they are either taught Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil. \nAs a result, most Singaporeans have at least conversational ability and basic literacy in a minimum of two languages: English, and the language that is used at home. Many more are conversant in three or more languages.\nOther languages.\nAbout 60% of Singapore's Indian population speaks Tamil as their native language. Other Indian languages include Malayalam and Hindi.\nThere are around 5,000 Peranakans living on the island, and they still use the Hokkien-influenced Malay dialect called Baba Malay.\nA handful of Portuguese Eurasians still speak a Portuguese-creole known as Papia Kristang. The most fluent speakers however, come from the pre-war generation."}

This includes Chinese and the Tibeto-Burman languages and some 250 languages of East Asia. Kra-Dai languages and Hmong\u2013Mien languages are also sometimes included. \nThe largest language within this family are the Chinese languages by far with over 1.3 billion native speakers. It is also the one with the oldest writing (hanzi) going back to the Jiahu symbols in 6600 BC.\nAll these languages descend from a single proto-language. People are still working on what this sounded like.\nWhere did it come from?\nSome researchers think the Sino-Tibetan languages very likely came from the Huanghe in North-Central China (Zhongyuan). Others think they came from much further west, in southwest China or even Northeast India.\nZhang et al. (2019) did a study of 109 Sino-Tibetan languages to suggest a Sino-Tibetan homeland in northern China near the Huanghe basin. He found there was a split between Sinitic languages and the Tibeto-Burman languages approximately 4,200-7,800 years ago (with an average of 5,900 years ago). This is connected with the expansion of the Yangshao culture and Majiayao culture. Others agree by using different data; they say it came from around 7,200 years ago, around the Cishan and early Yangshao culture.\nEvolution of language.\nProto-Chinese and Proto-Tibeto-Burman had many different prefixes and suffixes. Proto-Chinese changed to Old Chinese around the Shang Dynasty. This is shown in the Book of songs. Nouns, verbs, and modifiers were all dependent on affixes (beginning of words) such as *s-, *p-, *-k. After the Warring State Period in China, Old Chinese started using tones. The suffix (end of words) *-s was also used.\nThe typical word order in Sino-Tibetan languages is object-verb. Modern Chinese, Bai, Karenic, and Mruic are exceptions. \nSOV is likely the original word order. Over time Chinese became subject\u2013verb\u2013object. However, Chinese differs from almost all other VO languages in the world in placing relative clauses before the nouns they modify.\nRelation to other language families.\nSino-Tibetan may be related to the Altaic languages. Mang Mulin, a Mongolian linguistics professor at the Inner Mongolia Normal University, began studying the origin of Mongolian words in the late 1970s.\nThere are links between Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic (from South China), and Austronesian (from Taiwan) languages.\nThere may even be connections between Chinese and the native languages of the Americas (Na-Dene) and Western Eurasia (Yeniseian).

They use old shells for protection. They especially like old whelk shells. When the hermit crab grows in size, it finds a larger shell.\nDescription.\nThe hermit crab is a crustacean, but it is very different from other crustaceans. While most crustaceans are covered from head to tail with a hard exoskeleton, the hermit crab is missing part of its exoskeleton. The back part where its abdomen is located, is soft and squishy. Thus, the minute a hermit crab molts into an adult, it sets out to find a shell in which to live.\nTo get into the shell, the hermit crab squeezes in backwards, securing itself with its four back legs. The back legs have hooks that anchor the hermit crab into the shell without difficulty. The next four legs are used for walking, while the front two are its chelipeds. The chelipeds are not equal in size: one is big and other is small. The larger one is used for grabbing prey and guarding the entrance to its shell. All together, hermit crabs have a total of ten legs, including the chelipeds and the rear legs used to anchor to the shell.\nThere are about 500 different species of hermit crabs around the world, and they have different colors, often with patterns like stripes and dots on their bodies. Most hermit crab species live on the ocean floor, but many live on land. Female terrestrial (land based) hermit crabs must return to the sea to breed.\nDiet.\nHermit crabs are omnivores (eating plants and animals) and scavengers (eating dead animals that they find). They eat worms, plankton, lime chips, and organic debris.\nFossil Record.\nHermit crabs first appeared in the Cretaceous period, before the Dinosaurs became extinct (died out). Fossils have been found where they have used Ammonite shells.\nReproduction.\nThe reproductive (sexual) organs of hermit crabs are located near and just below the animal's heart and open to the outside at the base of the last pair of walking legs in the male. In the female, they are located at the base of the middle pair of walking legs. Female hermit crabs usually lay their eggs shortly after copulating (mating) but they can also store sperm (male sexual cells) for many months. The eggs are fertilised as they are laid by passing through the chamber holding the sperm. The eggs are carried and hatched in a mass attached to the abdomen inside the shell. The number of eggs is usually large, but depends on the animal's size.\nAs pets.\nBasic needs to keep pet Hermit Crabs: "}

It is not a vacuum tube diode, which has only two wires (electrodes), but has a third electrode, called the grid between the 2 wires (cathode (electric thrower) and anode (electric eater)). \nHow the word is created.\nThe word \u201ctriode\u201d comes from the word parts \u201ctri\u201d (three) + \u201code\u201d (way, road). \nHow it works.\nWhen the cathode becomes hot, it gives out electricity particles (electrons). These electrons are then taken by the anode. This makes an electric movement (current), which is controlled by the grid. The grid \u201cchecks\u201d how many electrons can pass through, and \u201ceats\u201d the extra ones. The grid lets the triode to be used as an electric amount changer (amplifier).\nThe grid can also quickly change the amount of electrons it lets through, so it can also be part of an oscillator (wave thrower) and wave taker (detector). \nHistory.\nPhilipp Lenard created the \u201cgrid\u201d idea in 1902 to make an electron taker.\nThen, the diode (Fleming valve) was created by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904.\nLee De Forest and Robert von Lieben created the triode in 1908 from his original Audion diode of 1906. The triode is used as an amplifier (electric amount changer). The name triode was created because people needed to know which kind of vacuum tube it is, rather than a diode, tetrode, or pentode.\nPeople wanted to talk to people far away. They used triodes to talk, by triode radio receivers (wave takers) and triode radio transmitters (wave throwers ). At first they only sent Morse code but better triodes later allowed talking by radio.\nThe triode transmitters were so good that they replaced the crystal transmitters to make the new listening devices (earphones)\nThis made the first way of talking far away, creating the beginning of radio broadcasting (sending radio waves to many people) around 1920. This made far away telephones better.\nThen people at the \u201cBell Telephone\u201d group made even better telephones that can catch waves that traveled about 800 miles. When they put the first long triode wave throwers in the (Atlantic) ocean (transcontinental telephone line) people were very happy 3 years after on January 25, 1915.\nOther people put the wave throwers in their creations, making very good things (television, public address systems, electric phonographs, and talking motion pictures)\nThen people started putting more wires inside, to 4 wires (tetrode, by Walter Schottky in 1916) to 5 wires (pentode, by Gilles Holst and Bernandus Dominicus Hubertus Tellegen in 1926). \nThe triode was used in other devices (radios, televisions, and audio systems) until it was beaten by the super wave thrower (transistor), made in 1947, ending the time of the triode.\nToday triodes are used in wave throwing and hot making. Triodes are also starting to be used in good electric audio machines and music machines. They are also used in glow makers (vacuum florescent displays, (VFDs), and there are different types of glow makers, but all use triodes.\nWhat it can be used for.\nRadios and telephones are also wave takers, so it is used in them. But it is too big, so from 1960 to 1969, the transistor has mostly replaced it. It is an ancestor of the transistor. It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers.\nToday, the triode is still used in iPods and radios and heaters to heat and to take waves."}

The language is a sub-dialect of Ladakhi and an archaic dialect of the Tibetan language, but many of the consonants that are silent in most modern Tibetan dialects are pronounced in Balti.\nBalti.\nAll people of different races, living in Baltistan are called Balti. Greeks used the word Byaltae instead of Bal-ti, which in Tibetan means water gorge. The historian Ptolemy who was also a general in the army of Alexander the Great had named the region (Byaltae) in his book. Baltistan is the Persian translation of \"Baltiyul\", \u201cThe Homeland of Balti\u201d. The people belonging to Balti nationality are settled on both banks of the river Indus from Kargil (in the east) to Haramosh (in the west) and from Karakoram range (in the north) to Deosai plains (in the south). In this nationality the majority comes from Tibetan origin. However people migrated to this area in different periods of ancient times, on account of different reasons and after merging in the prevailing Tibetan society, gave birth to a new civilisation. All these multi-racial groups speak Balti language, which is a branch of the ancient Tibetan language. However, in some rural areas, the Sheen people still speak Shina language.\nThe Balti are a very forbearing, cheerful,brave and hospitable people.

A Hydrogen car does not have to be a car, it can be any transportation vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way, like an aircraft.\nHydrogen Energy.\nHydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe. Even though it's simple and there's so much of it, hydrogen does not occur naturally as a gas on the earth: it's always combined with other things. Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution.\nFuel cells.\nIn principle, fuel cells are electrochemical devices like batteries that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity (DC) and heat, thus doing away with combustion. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging. It will produce energy in the form of electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied. \nA fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched around an electrolyte. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, generating electricity, water and heat. Layers of materials with distinct electrochemical properties are sandwiched together to form a single galvanic cell. At the heart lies a membrane that can only be crossed by charged molecules. Gas-permeable electrodes coated with a catalyst adhere to this membrane, adding a layer on either side. The electrodes are in turn connected to a device that can utilize electricity. Hydrogen gas flows into channels on one face of the cell and migrates through that electrode, while the same occurs with oxygen gas along the opposite electrode. Spurred by a catalyst, favorable chemistry causes the hydrogen to oxidize into hydrogen protons and give up its electrons to the neighboring electrode, which thereby becomes the anode. This buildup of negative charge then follows the path of least resistance via the external circuit to the other electrode. It is this flow of electrons through a circuit that creates electricity.\nProblem to solve for the practical use of hydrogen car.\nMost important problem involved in the practical use of hydrogen car is hydrogen storage materials. If it uses a fuel cell that generates electricity through reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, it does not matter. However, if method is that hydrogen is sprayed to internal-combustion engine, it does matter. Now hydrogen storage tank with highest possibility is method using metal hydride. Metal hydride is that reversible reaction between metal and hydrogen make new form of compound. Now Hydrogen storing technology using Hydrogen storage compound metal comes to practical use step in the side of technical, however, hydrogen storing capacity per weight is no match for demand of user, so this technology is not widely used yet. Therefore, that problem should be solved."}

Digital broadcasting system uses digital signals when they receive sound and movie. It is compared to analog TV that uses analog signals.\nBroadcasting.\nAccording to an ATSC standard, SDTV broadcasts in three ways.\nFirst, at ratio of length and width 16:9 and resolution 704x480.\nSecond, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 704x480 \nLastly, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 640x480.\nThe first one has best quality, second one is next, and the last one is the worst.\nThe screen's frame can be 24, 30, 60 per second.

{"id": "144002", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144002", "title": "Thermocouple", "text": "A thermocouple, TC for short, is a device that converts heat directly into electricity. A thermocouple can also work in reverse - using an electric current to transform into heat as well as cold.\nHow do thermocouples work?\nImagine that two wires made of different types of metal are connected at one end. If the junction of the two wires is heated, electricity will flow through the wire. \nElectrons, when heated, will begin to cross the junction on their own. Because of the different properties of the different metals, the electrons will lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, just like a ball rolling over a hill to a lower area. Although the voltage created by a thermocouple is very small (in the millivolt range), many thermocouples can be hooked together to make a larger voltage. This is called a thermopile.\nThermocouples can also generate heat from electricity, and even cold from electricity, acting as a refrigerator. If two different wires are connected at both ends, and some voltage source makes current flow through the loop, one junction will get hot and the other junction will become cold. The electrons at the hot junction are gaining kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the metal hot. The electrons at the cold junction are losing kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the junction cold.\nIt is difficult to measure the precise voltage that a thermocouple is producing when heat is applied to its junction. This is because any voltmeter wires that are connected to the thermocouple will probably be made of a different material than the wires of a thermocouple. This means that the connection between the voltmeter and the thermocouple is itself another thermocouple. Engineers designing microchips face the problem that virtually every electrical connection on a microchip is a thermocouple whether they want it to be or not.\nUse of thermocouple.\nGas heaters with pilot flames are one of the most famous examples for the use of thermocouples. Thermocouples are stacked to make a thermopile, which can generate enough voltage from the heat of the pilot flame to keep the gas valve open which in turn supplies the gas for the pilot flame. If the gas runs out, the flame extinguishes and the voltage across the thermopile decreases, which causes the electric gas valve to close. Many space probes get their electric power from a thermocouple in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.\nThermocouples are also used in other ways. For instance, they monitor temperatures in air conditioning and refrigerators, and of CPUs in computers, which could be destroyed by overheating.\nSome kinds of thermocouple.\nThere are hundreds of thermocouples, but only eight of them are standardized internationally.Type E (chromel\u2013constantan), type J (iron\u2013constantan), type N (nicrosil\u2013nisil), type T (copper\u2013constantan) and type K (chromel\u2013alumel) are base metals.Types B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum\u2013rhodium."}

Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical, electronic, and computer engineering. As engineering continues to develop, control engineering is often wanted.\nIn most cases, control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with sail control, the machine's speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system, which then adjusts the motor's spin power on the fly. Recently, control systems are also used in nanotechnology. In chemical engineering, control engineering is known as process control. Many advancements in science, finance, and even human action, can be attributed to control engineering. \nMany control systems rely on feedback. However, there are also control systems that work without feedback. Such a system is known as an open-loop control. An open-loop controller, also called a non-feedback controller, relies only on the model and the input signal fed to the system. An example of open-loop control can be found in washing machines, which work by running pre-programmed cycles but, most importantly, do not rely on any measurements of the speed of the barrel or water volume to adjust the machine on the fly."}

Its wheels are driven by electric motors.\nElectric vehicles were one of the first kinds that did not use horse or human power. Electric trains and cars were built in the 1830's, and in the early 1900's there were more electric cars than gasoline-powered cars. But cars powered by gasoline or diesel fuel become the most common kind of car for most of the last 100 years.\nElectric vehicles have long been used in some special cases, such as forklifts used inside a building, golf carts, trolley bus or certain vehicles used around airplanes at an airport. Early in the 21st century people are using more electric and hybrid vehicles again as a way to reduce pollution and use less gasoline.\nHistory.\nIt is unclear who the first inventor was, but \u00c1nyos Jedlik of Hungary built a small model of a working electric car in 1828. In the 1830's Robert Anderson of Scotland, Professor Stratingh of Holland and Thomas Davenport, a blacksmith from Vermont all built electric vehicles. Davenport is said to be the inventor of the DC electric motor. In 1865, Gaston Plante of France made a better battery. In 1886, the inventor Frank Sprague of Connecticut made important changes to the electric motor.\nGreat Britain and France were early leaders in making better electric cars. Interest in the electric car in the United States grew after 1891 when A. L. Ryker built a three-wheeled electric car, and William Morrison built a six-passenger wagon.\nThe years 1899 and 1900 were the best years for electric cars in America, as they outsold all other types of cars (steam, gasoline and diesel). One example was the 1902 Phaeton built by the Woods Motor Vehicle Company of Chicago, which had a range of 18 miles, a top speed of 14\u00a0mph and cost $2,000. (At that time, there were few good roads between towns, so most driving was for short distances). Electric cars could go as far as steam-powered cars and did not take 30 to 40 minutes to get started. Gasoline engines were smelly and noisy.\nBut then the internal combustion engine (that used gasoline and diesel) were greatly improved, and cars that used those engines could go much farther and faster than other cars.\nSome people would make electric cars in their garages by taking out the engine and putting in an electric motor and batteries, but for a long time, no big car company made an electric car. Only in the late 1990's did big car companies start making electric cars again. The most famous was the GM's EV-1. Now interest in alternative fuel vehicles is growing.\nKinds of electric vehicles.\nPure electric cars.\nThese types of cars do not have any kind of internal combustion engine, but are driven entirely using electric motors, which gets its power in different ways other than an engine.\nHybrid cars.\nA hybrid is a combination of two things. In this case, it is an electric motor, and another type of power, such as an engine. Because of this, hybrid vehicles are not true electric vehicles.\nOther vehicles.\nThere are many other types of electric vehicles. A trolley bus (also called a trackless trolley) uses overhead electric lines to power it. Many trains use a railway electrification system to supply power. A few high-speed rail lines use powered magnets in the track to move the train, in a system called 'mag-lev' (magnetic levitation). There are electric bicycles and motorcycles and some tricycles (trikes) like the Corbin Motors Sparrow, which was also seen in the Austin Powers movie Goldmember.\nMost freight trains are diesel-electric. The locomotive has a diesel engine which provides electricity, and an electric motor which makes the wheels turn. In recent years, however, there are buses and trains that store their power in a battery or use some other source like fuel cells. These kinds of vehicles do not need wires.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages: These vehicles use an electric motor, so they are very quiet, no smell and no pollution from exhaust gases. They can even be used indoors, in tunnels and mines. Oil for gasoline and diesel is a limited resource - it will not last forever and is becoming more expensive. If the electricity for a battery-electric vehicle comes from a renewable energy source, like a windmill, solar cells, geothermal or hydroelectric, then it will not produce as many global warming gases.\nDisadvantages: Batteries do not store a lot of energy, and they are large and heavy, so the vehicles usually cannot go very far. It takes a long time to recharge a battery, sometimes many hours. Good batteries can be very expensive, and all batteries need to be replaced after a while. Most electricity in the United States comes from coal or natural gas, so an electric vehicle that is powered by electricity from one of these plants will still add to global warming gases."}

Before World War II, electronic engineering was most commonly known as a 'radio engineering'. At that time, studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree. Later, as other electronic devices were developed, the field broadened to include radar, television, audio systems, Hi-Fi and later computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name 'electronic engineering', which then became a stand-alone university degree subject.\nEngineers must study the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to understand systems and make them better. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided technologies when designing electronics systems. Some electronic engineers work in robotics. "}

The male digs the nest (a simple scrape in the ground), incubates the eggs (for 6 weeks), and raises the chicks. Rheas are mature at 2 years of age.\nEvolution.\nIt was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous.

It is in the Southern Tablelands area of New South Wales, Australia. It is in Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council local government area. It is on the banks of Araluen Creek. The creek joins the Deua River. \nHistory.\nThe name 'Araluen' is an Australian Aboriginal word. It is believed to mean 'water lily' or 'place of the water lilies'. When European settlers arrived Araluen was a wide alluvial valley. It had many billabongs covered with water lilies. No billabongs exist in the Araluen valley today. The natural shape and look of Araluen Creek and its valley were completely destroyed by uncontrolled and very destructive gold mining. This took place during the 'gold rush' in the second half of the 1800s.\nThe first Europeans to explore the area were Kearns, Packer and Marsh in 1822. Andrew Badgery started farming cattle in the area in the 1830s. The first European settler to live at Araluen was Henry Burnell. He was able to buy 1280 acres of land. He started farming sheep and cattle in 1835. With the help of convicts he was able to build a farm house and farm buildings.\nGold.\nGold was found at Araluen by Alexander Waddell in September 1851. Thousands of people came to Araluen to look for gold during the gold rush. This included many Chinese gold miners. One of these miners was Quong Tart who came to Araluen when he was only nine years old. He later became a famous business man in Sydney. In the 1860s there were more than 20 hotels in Araluen. The gold was alluvial gold, found in the bottom of the creeks. In some places there was up to 12 metres of dirt and sand on top of the gold. In the 1870s the gold miners used hydraulic sluices (high pressure water hoses) to wash away all the sand and dirt. Big floating dredges (digging machines) were put in the creek. There were 11 there in the 1900s. The last dredge stopped working in 1932.\nA flood in the Araluen and Braidwood area killed 24 people on January 1, 1860. The flood destroyed the town. After the gold rush was over most people left the town. The Court House, built about 1861, is now used as a place for tourists to stay.\nBen Hall.\nIn May 1865 the bushranger Ben Hall and his gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach. The coach carried gold from the Araluen gold fields to Braidwood. This was a very steep road and very hard for a wagon pulled by horses to travel along. Often the only way to goods in and out of the valley was to drag them up or down on sleds. The wagons could not go very fast, so this was a good spot for the bushrangers to rob the coach. The gold coach usually had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver. There were two more policemen on the back of the carriage. Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach. The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach. (The coach has been restored and is on display at the Braidwood Museum)\n. The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach, but Constable Kelly was wounded in the shooting.\nFruit farms.\nThe Araluen valley is now well known for its fruit farms and orchards. The fruit is sent to Canberra, Sydney and to other countries.\nArts and Poetry.\nAustralian poet, Henry Kendall (1839-1882), wrote a poem called Araluen. This describes the quiet and peaceful mood of the valley. It includes the words \"Araluen -- home of dreams...\". He also called his first daughter Araluen. She was named after the Araluen Creek. She died in 1870 at the age of 13 months.\nAraluen is home to author Jackie French.\nIn November every year, the Braidwood Folk Music club have a weekend of folk music called \"Music at the Creek\". This is held at the Majors Creek reserve, near the site of the Ben Hall robbery.\nAraluen Zieria.\nThe Araluen Zieria (Zieria adenophora), is a small shrub about 50cm tall and 50\u00a0cm wide. It is only found in one place, a slope above the Araluen Creek. There are only 56 known plants. It has been listed as Endangered under the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. There is now a plan to protect the plant. These plans include:"}

It lives in grassland, scrubland and coastal regions of New Zealand, but is now so rare they can only be seen on protected offshore islands. Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the Maori language.\nKakapos are most active at night (nocturnal), and like to be alone. To keep other kakapos out of their territory, they make a 'skraaarking' sound. The Kakapo can live for about 60 years.\nDiet.\nKakapo are herbivores. They eat roots, seeds, leaves, bugs, small pine cones, fruit, and flowers.\nReproduction.\nUnlike other parrots, male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound. There are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid. The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree. The female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks. She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food.\nConservation.\nKakapo had almost no natural animals that wanted to eat it on the islands of New Zealand where they live, and lost the ability to fly. At one time there were many kakapo. Now only about 150 kakapo still live in New Zealand. It is a critically endangered species. The decrease in the number of kakapo is mostly from predatory animals (for example, cats, dogs, stoats, ferrets, and rats) that settlers brought with them to New Zealand. The kakapo was also eaten by Maori and European settlers.\nBefore humans brought mammals like cats and stoats, the main predator of the kakapo was flying birds of prey. Birds of prey find animals to eat by looking for them from high above. The kakapo would stand very still so the bird of prey would not find it. But cats and stoats can find animals to eat by smelling them. Standing still did not help the kakapo escape from cats and stoats.\nAt one point, kakapo were almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of January 2009, surviving Kakapos are kept on two predator-free islands, Codfish (Whenua Hou) and Anchor islands, where they are closely monitored. Two large Fiordland islands, Resolution and Secretary, have been prepared as self-sustaining ecosystems for the Kakapo.\nThe conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being \"Two in the Bush\", made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962. A feature-length documentary, won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival.\nTwo of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are \"Kakapo - Night Parrot\" (1982) and \"To Save the Kakapo\" (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in \"The Life of Birds\". It was also one of the endangered animals that Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book \"Last Chance to See\". An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island."}

Instead, each player at the table must ante first, and then is dealt two cards face down (hole cards) and one card face up. In typical stud games, the player with the lowest card showing must pay the \u2018bring in,\u2019 an amount relative to the limits, which starts off the action.\nThe bring in is typically a fraction of the limits, (for example, the bring in for a $1/2 stud game may be $.25), with play then continuing clockwise around the table, where players have the choice of folding, calling the bring in, or making the bet \u2018complete\u2019 (in our example, completing the bet to $1). Once a bring in has been completed, it can be raised by a subsequent player, doubling the amount to twice the completed bet.\nEach player remaining in the hand is then dealt another card face up, with the betting beginning with the player showing the highest two cards and proceeding clockwise around the table. Again, players can fold, call, or raise the bet. In a five card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then two cards face up, with the fifth card being dealt facedown. In a seven card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then four cards face up, with the seventh card being dealt facedown.\nBetting takes place between each dealt card and generally becomes a higher amount after the fourth card dealt. \nEach round of betting is typically referred to by the number of cards a player has in front of them. After the initial deal, players are considered to be betting on \u2018third street\u2019, represented by having three cards in front of them. After the fourth card is dealt, players would then be on \u2018fourth street\u2019, and so on. Stud poker is generally played as a limit game. "}

In 2006 there were 9,826 people living in Parkes. It is the centre and main city of the Local Government Area of Parkes Shire. Parkes is on the main Australian transcontinental railway line between Sydney and Perth. The Newell Highway between Victoria and Queensland goes through the city.\nParkes today.\nParkes has had an important role in science. it is the home of the Parkes Radio Telescope. As well as local research done at the radio telescope, Parkes scientists have helped NASA. For several missions the telescope was the Southern Hemisphere relay and communications station. The movie \"The Dish\" was based on the job of the telescope during the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing.\nThere are many different kinds of farms around Parkes. Most farms are growing wheat and sheep.\nParkes is has a gold and copper mine, Northparkes, north of the town.\nParkes was an important transport centre after the railway was built in 1893. Many passenger and freight trains stopped at Parkes up until the 1980s. Governments began cutting back the NSW country rail systems and the trains are no longer an important part of Parkes. One company, FCL has a big train and truck transport centre at Gooobang Junction on Parkes' western edge. It was opened on 20 October 2006 by NSW Premier Morris Iemma. Specialised Container Transport's transport terminal is built on a 296 hectare site. It has 5\u00a0km of railway sidings, a 7,400 square metre warehouse and about 40 people work there. An even larger terminal to be built nearby is also being planned.\nOver the years governments and businesses have talked about making Parkes an \"inland port\". Parkes Regional Airport would be made much bigger. This would become a starting point for goods coming from Australia and other countries that were to be sent to places in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. All the studies have been done, agreements to start building have been made, some land has been bought.\nThe Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW has the Western Regional Office built in Parkes. Country Energy which supplies electricity and gas has a training and maintenance (repair) centre.\nMany people come to Parkes to see the CSIRO radio telescope which is 20km north of town on the Newell Highway. other things to see are Bushmans Hill, and the War Memorial Lookout. Nearby there is the Goobang National Park, and Peak Hill. peak Hill has an open cut mine (a big hole in the ground) that can be visited during holidays. There are also many great parks.\nHistory.\nParkes was started as a settlement in 1853. It was first called \"Currajong\" after the many kurrajong trees in the local area. After a while it was called \"Bushman's\" after the local gold mine named Bushman's Lead.\nIn 1873 the town was renamed to Parkes in honour of Sir Henry Parkes. He is called the \"Father of the Federation\". Sir Henry Parkes is famous in Australia for getting Australia to become one country in 1901. Before this Australia was made up of separate British colonies.\nA lot of people came to Parkes in the gold rush of the 1870s. There are still mining companies with sites in the local area.\nGeography.\nParkes has a dry climate. The winter temperatures are rarely lower than 0 degrees Celsius during the night. In summer daytime temperatures can be as high as 40 to 45 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in the low to mid-30s are most common.\nTransport.\nParkes has a local bus service run by Western Road Liners. It took over from Harris Bus Lines in March 2006. The Indian Pacific train also stops twice a week. The Broken Hill Outback Xplorer service, run by CountryLink, goes to Broken Hill on Mondays and to Sydney on Tuesdays. Parkes railway station is situated on the Broken Hill railway line. It was opened in 1893. There was also a small station at Parkes Racecourse from 1923 to 1937.\nEvents.\nParkes hosts a yearly Elvis Presley Festival in early January to celebrate Elvis Presley's birthday. The first festival, held in 1993, was a one night show with 200 people coming along. Over the next few years more events were added and the festival was extended to two days. By January 2005 the 3,500 people came to the festival. In January 2006 there were 5,000 going to the festival. It brought about $8 million into Parkes.\nThe 2007 festival had over 60 events and was held over 5 days. More than 6,000 visitors attended. A new world record was set for the most Elvis impersonators (people trying to look like Elvis) in one place. SBS TV made a half-hour film about the festival. It was called \"Elvis Lives in Parkes\". It was shown on Australian TV on 10 January 2007. The festival is still getting bigger with more than 8,000 visitors in 2008."}

They are three concepts used to explain the way the human mind works.\nFreud describes the human mind as interaction of id, ego, super-ego. The ego, and to some extent the super-ego, is conscious or on the surface. The id remains unconscious. Together they make up the personality.\nAccording to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralising role.\nThe id, ego and super-ego are functions of the mind, \"not\" parts of the brain. They do not correspond one-to-one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience.\nId.\nThe id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present. The id is governed by the 'pleasure principle'.\nEarly in the development of his theory Freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id. After the tragedy of World War I, however, Freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id. So, he proposed thanatos, the death instinct. Thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind. Obviously, the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts. By adding thanatos, he could describe more mental phenomena. His idea of id had wide influence.\nThe id is unconscious by definition: \nEgo.\nThe ego is the sense of self and the surface of the personality, the part you usually show the world. The ego is governed by the 'reality principle', or a practical approach to the world. It seeks to turn the id\u2019s drive to behaviour which brings benefits in the long term rather than grief.\nConscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious.\nThe ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organise our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. \nBut the ego \"serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id\".110 Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. \"Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it, and readily 'breaks out in anxiety\".110/1\nSuper-Ego.\nThe Super-ego aims for perfection and the ideal outcome. It comprises that part of the personality, mainly unconscious, which includes the individual's ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called \"conscience\") that criticises and prohibits his or her drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. \nThe superego consists of two parts, the conscience and the ego-ideal. The conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder. The conscience decides what course of action one should take. The ego-ideal is an idealized view of one's self. Comparisons are made between the ego-ideal and one's actual behavior. Both parts of the super-ego develop through experience with others or via social interactions. According to Freud, a strong super-ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id, while a weak super-ego gives in to the id's urgings. Further, the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low, respectively."}

The basic way to make Doenjang is to take Mejus and put them into big jars with sea water. Bad bacteria and odor are removed by adding charcoal and sun-dried chili peppers. Liquid is then taken out to make Korean soy sauce. This sauce takes about 20 to 30 days to make. The Mejus are taken out from the jar and tempered. Salt and soy sauce is added on this paste and the paste is put in jars again. After sun-drying for several days, it becomes Doenjang.\nVariety.\nThere are several kinds of Doenjang; Chungukjang, Makjang, Dambukjang, BbamjangBbagaejang, Patjang, Jipjang, Garoojang, and Borijang.

Patjang uses red bean. Makjang is made in Spring.\nMoreover there are several attempts to improve doenjang using additional ngredients, such as green tea.\nUse.\nMany traditional Korean foods, which are well known as healthy food, uses Doenjang as their ingredients. Doenjang Jjigae and Chungukjang JJigae are examples of this.\nAlso, Korean have doenjang when they eat Ssambop, Samgyupsal, etc.\nHealth.\nAccording to recent research, Doenjang has several materials that prevent cancer.

The province covered an area of ,including much of the current Punjab province and the Islamabad Capital Territory, but excluding the former princely states of Bahawalpur. The capital was the city of Lahore and the province was mad up of four divisions (Lahore, Sargodha, Multan and Rawalpindi). The province was bordered by the Indian states of East Punjab to the east, the princely state of Bahawalpur to the south, the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh to the southwest, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northwest, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Occupied Kashmir to the northeast.\nHistory.\nThe independence of Pakistan in 1947 led to the divisions of the Punjab province into two new provinces. The East Punjab where most people were Sikh and Hindu became part of the new nation of India while the mainly Muslim West Punjab became part of the new nation of Pakistan. The name of the province was shortened to Punjab in 1950. West Punjab was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1955 under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali. When that province was dissolved, the area of the former province of West Punjab was combined with the former state of Bahawalpur to form a new Punjab Province.\nPeople.\nAt independence there was a Muslim majority in West Punjab with significant minorities of Hindus and Sikhs. Nearly all of these minorities left West Punjab for India, to be replaced by large numbers of Muslims fleeing in the opposite direction. The official language of West Punjab was Urdu but most of the population spoke Punjabi using the Shahmukhi script.\nGovernment.\nThe offices of \"Governor\" of West Punjab and \"Chief Minister\" of West Punjab lasted from August 15 1947, until 14th October 1955. The first Governor was Sir Francis Mudie with Iftikhar Hussain Khan as the first Chief Minister. Both offices were abolished in 1955, when the province of West Pakistan was created. The last Governor of West Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani, became the first Governor of West Pakistan."}

This hurricane blasted the Bahamas, southeast Florida and south central Louisiana, taking a path extremely similar to Hurricane Betsy, which also struck southern Florida and Louisiana. However, unlike Betsy, Andrew did not make flooding in New Orleans. Contrary to typical, damage from Hurricane Andrew was caused almost entirely by high winds rather than storm surge in Florida and Louisiana. This storm caused between $23 billion and $37 billion in damage (1992 USD) and between 56 and 68 fatalities, making Andrew the costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States.\nHowever, Hurricane Katrina would later surpass Andrew in official damage amounts.\nAftermath.\nFlorida.\nAndrew's devastating damage spawned many rumors. These included claims that hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south Dade County (now Miami-Dade County) were killed and their deaths were not reported in official accounts. An investigation by the \"Miami Herald\" found no basis for such rumors. These rumors were probably based on the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, when the deaths of migrant workers initially went uncounted, and were still debated at the time of Andrew.\nThe slow response of federal aid to storm victims in southern Florida led Dade County emergency management director Kate Hale to become famous. At a nationally televised news conference, she exclaimed: \"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?\" Almost immediately, President George H. W. Bush promised, \"Help is on the way,\" and mobile kitchens and tents, along with units from the 82nd Airborne Division, began pouring in.\nInsurance claims in the wake of the extreme damage caused by Andrew led to the bankruptcy and closure of 11 insurance agencies and drained an excessive amount of equity from 30 more. Nearly one million residences were no longer eligible for coverage by any insurance agency. This led the Florida Legislature to create new agencies (the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund) to restore important insurance coverage.\nHomeowners and officials criticized developers and contractors for poor building practices and poor building codes. An inquiry after the storm concluded that there were probably construction flaws in some buildings, and that the state of Florida did enforce some strict building codes since 1986, but they were either overlooked or ignored. However, the evidence was not sufficient enough to issue criminal charges for neglect.\nThe effects of Hurricane Andrew on Florida wetlands were considerable. In the Florida Everglades, 25%, 70,000 acres (280\u00a0km\u00b2) of trees were knocked down by the storm. It took 20\u00a0days for new trees and vegetation to grow following the storms passing. Damage to marine life was moderate as the storm lowered the oxygen level in the water, threatening many fish and other marine wildlife. In addition, the storm killed 182\u00a0million fish in the basin, causing $160\u00a0million (1992 USD) in lost value. \nIn the decade after the storm, Hurricane Andrew may have contributed to the massive and sudden housing boom in Broward County, Florida. Located just north of Miami-Dade County, residents who had lost their homes moved to western sections of the county that were just starting to be developed. The result was record growth in places like Miramar, Pembroke Pines and Weston.\nLouisiana.\nIn Louisiana, the hurricane knocked down 80% of the trees in part of the Atchafalaya River Basin near the coast. Offshore, the storm killed 9.4\u00a0million fish, causing $7.8\u00a0million (1992 USD) in lost value, and damaged large areas of marshland along the Louisiana coast.\nAbout 6,200\u00a0people had to be housed in 36 shelters, according to the American Red Cross. The Salvation Army sent in 37 mobile food storages, that served 40,000 meals, to help those who could get little or no food.\nFederal aid, from the Pentagon, sent in four 750 kilowatt generators, 2,500 cots, and 30,000 MRE's, or prepackaged meals, to Louisiana. About 1,279 National Guard were deployed to Louisiana, to do various duties, from cooking to patrolling.\nSheriffs along the coast of Louisiana proposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time. Alcohol sales were also stopped immediately after the storm.\nRetirement.\nBecause of exceptional and widespread damage in Florida and Louisiana, the name \"Andrew\" was retired in the Spring of 1993. It will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Alex for the 1998 season."}

The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates are between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Hurricane Gordon was the last storm of the inactive 1994 Season and the second most costly of the 1994 season, even though the storm was a hurricane for only a few hours.\nStorm History.\nOn November 8 a tropical wave near Costa Rica became Tropical Depression Twelve. On November 10th in made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The same day it became Tropical Storm Gordon after moving back into the Caribbean. It made its first landfall near Kingston, Jamaica on November 13 it soon made its second landfall in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on the same day. The storm brushed the northern coast of Cuba and the southern islands of the Bahamas. It made its third landfall in Key West, Florida on November 15. Gordon turned northeast and made it fourth landfall in Fort Myers, Florida the next day. When Gordon crossed Florida it took about nine hours and it went into the Atlantic Ocean on a northeastward track. Gordon stayed on that track until November 17, when it became Hurricane Gordon while it was about 245 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly after becoming a hurricane it reached top winds of 85\u00a0mph and then brushed the coast of North Carolina. Gordon weakened back to a tropical storm and started on a U-shaped track. Gordon weakened further into a tropical depression and on November 19 it made its fifth and last landfall near Vero Beach, Florida and on November 21 Gordon died out while over South Carolina.\nImpact.\nHaiti.\nThe damage in Haiti is unknown. But in Haiti, Hurricane Gordon killed about 1,122 people. The number is high likely because of mudslides and because of the deforestation (removing trees) of the forests in Haiti.\nFlorida.\nFlorida was where most of the damage was. Damage in Florida was at about $400 million. Gordon also crossed the state three times, which is likely why the damage is that high. \nNo retirement.\nIn the spring of 1995 Gordon was not retired even though it caused lots of deaths in Haiti. Since Gordon was not retired in 1994, the name Gordon was used again in 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. The name will next be used in 2024."}

{"id": "144643", "revid": "641508", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144643", "title": "Bull shark", "text": "The Bull shark (\"Carcharhinus leucas\"), or Zambezi shark, is a species of shark of the genus \"Carcharhinus\".\nThe shark grows to a maximum length of 11.5 feet (3.5 metres), but is usually 7.3-7.8 feet (2.2-2.3 metres) long. It is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters worldwide, as well as river systems and freshwater lakes.\nThis species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, and is considered to be the third most dangerous sharks in the world.\nDescription.\nBull sharks have a very sturdy body, and have a blunt, rounded snout, giving the Bull shark its name. The first dorsal fin is large and widely triangular with a pointed tip. The second dorsal fin is noticeably smaller. The pectoral fins are also large, and have sharp tips. Bull sharks have quite small eyes as compared to other carcharhinid sharks, which might mean that vision is not a very important hunting tool for this species which is usually found in muddy waters. Bull sharks are usually pale to dark grey above, and their undersides are white. In young Bull sharks, the fins have black tips which turn to a dusky colour as they grow.\nThe teeth of the upper jaw are wide, triangular, and heavily jagged. The teeth of the lower jaw have a wide base, and are narrow, triangular, and are finely jagged. The front teeth are raised and are nearly symmetrical, while the back teeth are more slanted in shape.\nThe maximum weight is over 500 pounds (230\u00a0kg). The size at birth is around 29 inches (75\u00a0cm). Females are larger than males, reaching a length of around 7.8 feet (2.4 metres) as adults, and weighing around 285 pounds (130\u00a0kg). This is the result of a longer lifespan of about 16 years, compared to 12 years for males. Males reach a length of around 7.3 feet (2.2 metres), and weigh 209 pounds (95\u00a0kg). The growth rates calculated from captive Bull sharks were estimated to be about 11 inches (28\u00a0cm) per year in the first years of life, slowing to half that rate after about 4 years of age.\nHabitat.\nThe Bull shark is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters worldwide as well as in many river systems and some freshwater lakes. They have been reported 3700\u00a0km (2220 miles) up the Amazon River in Peru, and over 3000\u00a0km (1800 miles) up the Mississippi River in Illinois. A group of Bull sharks found in Lake Nicaragua (Central America) was once thought to be landlocked, but they found access to the ocean through rivers and estuaries. In the western Atlantic Bull sharks migrate north along the coast of the U.S during summer, swimming as far north as Massachusetts, and then return to tropical climates when the coastal waters cool.\nThe Bull shark likes to live in shallow coastal waters less than 100 feet deep (30 metres), but ranges from 3\u2013450 feet deep (1\u2013135 metres). It commonly enters estuaries, bays, harbours, lagoons, and river mouths. It is the only known shark species which is found in freshwater, and can spend long periods of time in such environments. It is not likely that the Bull shark's entire life cycle is within a freshwater system, however. There is evidence that they can breed in freshwater, but not as regularly as they do in estuarine and marine habitats. Young Bull sharks enter estuaries with low salt contents and lagoons as readily as adults do, and use these shallow areas as nursery grounds. They can also live in waters with high salt contents; as high as 53 parts per thousand.\nBehaviour.\nEven though humans are not on their diet, bull sharks have been known to be very aggressive towards humans. This shark can be a danger to people since many people don't have the knowledge that Bull sharks can be found in rivers and freshwater. Almost all of the close to shore shark attacks on humans have been caused by this species.\nThey are listed as the 3rd largest risk to humans when it comes to sharks. They are only behind the Great White Shark and the Tiger shark.\nThey are very territorial and they will attack anything that gets into their environment and they feel is a risk. They have been known to bite horses and other animals that come to close to the water.\nAlthough the Bull shark has no real predators, young Bull sharks have been known to fall prey to Tiger sharks, Sandbar sharks, and even adult Bull sharks. Parasites, like \"Pandarus sinuatus\" and \"Perissopus dentatus\", have been found in Bull sharks, and parasitize the body surface of this shark.\nDiet.\nThe Bull shark mainly feeds on bony fish and small sharks. In the western Atlantic they commonly feed on mullet, tarpon, catfish, menhaden, gar, snook, jacks, mackerel, snappers, and other schooling fish. They also regularly feed on stingrays and young sharks including small individuals of their own species in their inshore nursery habitats. Bull sharks are also been known to feed on sea turtles, dolphins, crabs, shrimp, sea birds, squid, terrestrial mammals, echinoderms, and crustaceans. Bull sharks often appear sluggish as they slowly swim along the bottom, but are quite quick and good at capturing smaller, agile prey, and are capable of burst speeds of over 11\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h).\nBull sharks may spend many hours each day looking for food. They will eat heavily too when there is a large amount of food to be found. They mostly hunt on their own, but there have been observed times when a pair of Bull Sharks will hunt as a team.\nReproduction.\nBull sharks are viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. The gestation period is about one year, usually during the summer months but sometimes in early autumn as well. Bull sharks usually migrate to river mouths to mate and have their young. Pups are about 60\u00a0cm (24 inches) long, and mothers give birth to 5 to 15 pups at a time. Coastal lagoons, river mouths, and estuaries with low salt contents are common nursery habitats.\nBull sharks reach maturity depending on where they are. One study in the southern Gulf of Mexico found that the age of maturity was 10 years (7 feet) for females and 9\u201310 years (6.2-6.6 feet) for males. Another study in the northern Gulf of Mexico showed that the age of maturity was 7 feet (14\u201315 years) for males and 7.4 feet (18 years) for females.\nOther names.\nThe Bull shark gets its name from its sturdy appearance and aggressive nature. In French, the Bull shark is known as \"requin bouledogue\". In Spanish it is known as \"tiburon sarda\". It is known by many different names throughout its range including \"Zambezi shark\" and \"Van Rooyen's shark\" in Africa, \"Ganges shark\" (India), \"Nicaragua shark\" (Central America), and \"Freshwater whaler\", \"Estuary whaler\", and \"Swan River whaler\" in Australia. In English it is also known as the \"Shovelnose shark\", \"Square-nose shark\", \"River shark\", \"Slipway grey shark\", \"Ground shark\", and \"Cub shark\".\nConservation.\nAlthough the Bull shark is rarely the target species of commercial fisheries, it is usually caught accidentally along with other catches. Since it is found inshore, it has been made a target for artisanal fisheries. The meat of the Bull shark is eaten by humans, the hide is used for leather, the fins are used in shark-fin soup and the liver is made into vitamin-rich oils. In certain areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, the Bull shark is also a popular game fish. The Bull shark\u2019s inshore and freshwater habitat not only makes it an easier target of fisheries, but since these habitats are usually polluted and are targets to habitat modification, the Bull shark is in danger. The Bull shark is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN\nDanger to humans.\nAccording to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), Bull sharks are responsible for at least 69 unprovoked attacks on humans around the world, 17 of which have resulted in deaths. However, this species is likely to be responsible for many more attacks, and has been considered by many experts to be the most dangerous shark in the world. Because of its large size, its ability to enter freshwater, and the fact that it is found inshore, it might be more of a threat to humans than either the Great White Shark or the Tiger shark. Since the Bull shark is found in many Third World regions including Central America, Mexico, India, east and west Africa, the Middle East, southeast Asia, and south Pacific islands, attacks are often not reported. The Bull shark is also not as easily identifiable as the Great White or the Tiger shark, so it is likely to be responsible for a large percentage of attacks with unidentified culprits.\nThe Bull shark has been considered to be the culprit in the infamous series of five shark attacks in New Jersey in 1916 which resulted in four deaths over a 12-day period. Three of these attacks happened in Matawan Creek, a shallow tidal river, only 40 feet (12 metres) across, 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) from bay waters, and over 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from the open ocean; not a location where any other large shark species would likely be found. A 7.5 foot (2.25 metres) Great White was captured two days after the last attack, however, just 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) from the mouth of Matawan Creek, and contained human remains in its stomach. A 9-foot (2.7 m) Bull shark was also captured a day later only 10 miles (16\u00a0km) from Matawan. This has been a topic of debate for many years, and there is evidence that points at both, the Bull shark and the Great White as the culprits."}

The term is used in France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Sometimes the term is used to describe everyone who left the country because of changes in the government.\nHistory.\nThe words \"White \u00e9migr\u00e9\" had a very negative meaning in the Soviet Union between 1920 and 1980. After 1980, those people who left during that time are called first wave \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\nMany White \u00e9migr\u00e9s thought the White movement was something good. Some of them, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, did not like the Bolsheviks but did not like the White movement either. Others were just not interested in politics. Many of those who left are still part of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nMost White \u00e9migr\u00e9s left Russia between 1917 and 1920. Between 900,000 and two million people left. Many different classes of people left. These classes included military soldiers and officers, Cossacks, intellectuals, businessmen and landowners. Officials of the Russian Imperial Government and anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War also left.\nDistribution.\nMost \u00e9migr\u00e9s left Southern Russia and Ukraine and went to Turkey. They then moved to eastern European Slavic countries, for example the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. A large number also went to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and France. Berlin and Paris had large \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities.\nMany civilians and military officers in Siberia and the Far East moved to Shanghai and other surrounding areas of China, Central Asia, and Eastern Turkestan. Some moved to Japan.\nDuring and after World War II, many Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s moved to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia.\nWhat the people believed.\nWhite \u00e9migr\u00e9s often did not like Communism. They did not believe the Soviet Union was properly Russian. They believed the period of time from 1917 until 1991 was a time of occupation by the Soviet government which was internationalist and anti-Christian.\nMany White \u00e9migr\u00e9s believed that Russia should be governed by a monarch. Others thought that the government should be chosen by popular plebiscite.\nMany White \u00e9migr\u00e9s believed that their mission was to keep the culture and way of life from the time before the revolution while living in other countries. They believe that by doing this, they could return Russia to this culture when the Soviet Union was no longer in control of the country.\nA religious mission to the outside world was another idea used by the \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Bishop John of Shanghai and San Francisco (canonized as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad) said at the 1938 All-Diaspora Council:\nMany White \u00e9migr\u00e9s also believed that they should still fight against the Soviet dictatorship. They hoped this would help free Russia. This idea was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel. When the White army was defeated, he said, \"The battle for Russia has not ceased, it has merely taken on new forms\". (\"We are not done trying to free Russia. We just have to use different ways to do so.\")\nWhite army veteran Captain Vasili Orekhov, publisher of the \"Sentry\" journal, wrote about this idea of responsibility with the following words:\nOrganizations and activities.\nThe \u00e9migr\u00e9s formed different organisations which had the purpose of fighting against the Soviet regime. Examples of such organisations are the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the NTS. This made the White \u00e9migr\u00e9s a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police (i.e. operation TREST and the Inner Line). Seventy-five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.\nSome White \u00e9migr\u00e9s adopted pro-Soviet sympathies, for which they were labelled \"Soviet patriots\". These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi.\nDuring World War II, many White \u00e9migr\u00e9s took part in the Russian Liberation Movement. On the other hand, a significant number participated in anti-Nazi movements such as the French Resistance. During the war, the White \u00e9migr\u00e9s came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West, often referred to as the \"second wave\" of \u00e9migr\u00e9s (often also called DPs \u2013 displaced persons, see Displaced persons camp). This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the White \u00e9migr\u00e9 community.\nAfter the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS: other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage.\nThe White \u00e9migr\u00e9s, acting to preserve their church from Soviet influence, formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924. The church continues its existence to this day, acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad. On May 17, 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, after more than eighty years of separation."}

The male equivalent is Deva, the female aspect of the divine. Devi is synonymous with Shakti, the female aspect of the divine. She has many different incarnations. Among these incarnations are Saraswati, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, and Parvati. The Hindu worshipers of Devi are called 'Shaktas'.\nHindus believe in millions of female gods. Each goddess of the Hindus has her own story and history. They all look different too. Some goddesses can change how they look, so they have two or three different images. Some learned persons think that all Hindu goddesses are different forms of a single big or supreme goddess. Some learned persons also think that worship of goddesses by Hindus shows their respect for female gender.\nOrigins.\nIndus Valley.\nThe Indus Valley Civilization was an old civilization of Ancient India. It lasted from 3000 to 1500BC. Archeologists found some female figures at some places of this civilization. Some persons believe that these figures show the worship of goddess at that time. Some learned persons think that people of that time worshipped a mother goddess. This was similar to worship of a mother goddess in the Mediterranean.\nVedic period.\nThe Vedic period or Vedic civilization of India was a very old civilization. Vedas tell about a number of goddesses. Some of the names of goddesses are Ushas, Prithivi, Aditi, Saraswati, Vac, Nirrti, Ratri. Beside them, some more names of goddesses are there like Puramdhi, Parendi, Raka, Dhisana. Some more names are like Ila, Bharati, Mahi, and Hotra.\nSome important goddesses of Hindus are Lakshmi, Parvati, Sita, Radha, Durga, Kali, Mahadevi, Matrakas, Tara, Chhinnamasta, Mahavidyas, and many more. Some goddesses are also connected with places and rivers.\nManifestations.\nDurga.\nDurga is one of the most powerful goddesses of Hindus. Hindu scriptures say that Durga came to kill the asuras, that is, the demons. Male gods had failed to control asuras and she was created. She has the powers of all the male gods combined. Mainly Durga is the fighting and most powerful form of Parvati. She is often pictured riding a tiger or a lion.\nSaraswati.\nSaraswati is the goddess of speech and learning. She is the Goddess of science, arts and music. The Vedas tell about her. In her hands, she holds a book, a rosary, a pot of water, and a lute. She is also considered as daughter of Parvati or Durga. Maha Saraswati is the partition form of Parvati`s mahavidya (power of super learning). The mahavidya have two forms. One is maha saraswati and another is neel saraswati. In ancient times, there was also a river named the Saraswati River. The river dried up long ago. This river was also considered a form of this goddess. Saraswati is also the wife of Brahma \"god of knowledge, wisdom, and many other things\".\nmaha Lakshmi.\nLakshmi, also called Sri or Sri Lakshmi is an important goddess of Hindus. Lakshmi is the epitome of everything good and prosperous in the world. She as the power behind Lord Vishnu, aids in the preservation of the world. Lakshmi like Vishnu has many incarnation the most important ones being: Sita, Radha and Rukmini.actually Maha laxmi is the partition form of the beauty of parvati or Durga.devi laxmi is also worshipped as goddess of power or cursed free devi.she is worshipes by name of mahalaxmi, dhan ki devi matalaxmi, shree laxmi. she plays an important role on tridevi's place.\nParvati.\nAfter death of Sati, the divine power or Shakti was reformed from the 51 shakti peeth. By this Goddess Sati was reborn as Goddess Parvati. In Sanskrit language, Parvati means a daughter of the mountains, the Himalayas. she again married Shiva. so Goddess Parvati is the wife of Shiva, one of the three main Hindu gods. She has two son called Ganesh and Kartikeya. She is also called Gauri she has eighteen arms and forty legs.She also have more than 108 names. Durga, Kali, Jagadatri, Bharat Mata (mother India) are the popular forms of the goddess Parvati.\nKali.\nKali is one of the main goddesses of Hindus. She is a very powerful goddess. Sometimes she is also called Chandi. Durga and Kali killed many asuras (demons) who used to disturb human beings.\nKali is a form of Durga that sprang from her head during Durga's battle with the demon Raktabija (who represents the power of thoughts, the power which constantly and unceasingly reproduce in the mind) whose blood when touch to the earth generated another Raktabija. To end this battle between Raktabeeja and Durga, Kali consumed every drop of blood until Raktabija Bled out. \nKali is the highest form of the Supreme. Kali's name has two meanings; the first meaning is \"dark\" which means she represents the Void. The second meaning is \"Time\" which is the Destroyer of Everything. When Asur and Dev were having samudra madan than halahal came out, shani was who was ready to drink that poison halahal, than Lord Shiva stopped him and said i will drink, when he drank that he was about to die, but mahakali came to save him. and he was saved. If there is death then there is also life.\nSati.\nSati is a Hindu goddess. She is the 1st form of divine power or Shakti. She was the daughter of Dakshya-raj. She was the 1st wife of Lord Shiva.After death of Sati in the Dakshya-Yagna, Shiva took the deadbody of Sati and started dance. By Sudarshana Chakra Lord Vishnu cut the body parts of Sati. The parts were falled at the 51 places in the Indian subcontinent area. These places are called 51 Shakti peeth. Many forms of shakti like Durga, Kali, Kamakshya, Hingula are being worshiped in these places.\nBhuvaneswari.\nThe concept of Goddess Bhuvaneswari as the supreme goddess emerged in historical religious literature as a term to define the powerful and influential nature of female deities in India. Throughout history, goddesses have been portrayed as the mother of the universe, through whose powers the universe is created and destroyed. The gradual changes in belief through time shape the concept of Bhuvaneswari and express how the different Goddesses, though very different in personality, all carry the power of the universe on their shoulders.\nOther aspects.\nSita.\nSita is one of the most popular goddesses of Hindus. Hindus of north India especially worship her. She is an avatar of Lakshmi. She was married to Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. Hindu scriptures say that Vishnu and Laxmi are husband and wife.\nRadha.\nThe word Radha means riches and success. Her name comes with the name of Krishna, another avatar of Vishnu. Some Hindu scriptures describe her as a form or avatar of goddess Lakshmi."}

The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. This was the start of European settlement in Australia.\nDescription.\nThe ship of 520 tons was built on the River Thames, England in 1781. She was first called the \"Berwick.\". She had been built to work in the Baltic Sea to carry timber. The Royal Navy bought it to use as a store ship. She was refitted for the trip to Australia, and renamed \"HMS Sirius\". Lieutenant Philip Gidley King wrote that the ship was named after the star in the Orion constellation.She was armed with six carronades, short cannons used to fire large objects to smash ships. She also had four six-pounder guns. There were another ten six-pounder guns in the cargo hold to be used to protect the new settlement. HMS Sirius was about long and wide. Her hold was about deep.\nThe crew.\nThe ship was commanded by Arthur Phillip with John Hunter as second captain. Phillip would be in charge of the ship as part of the First Fleet, and then Hunter would be in charge after while Phillip was setting up the penal colony. King, William Bradley and George William Maxwell were the lieutenants. She carried a crew of about 160 men.\nWith the First Fleet.\n\"HMS Sirius\" carried all the guns and ammunition for the Fleet. No weapons were kept on the convict transports in case of mutiny. She left England on May 13, 1787, and sailed to Australia with stops at Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. She arrived in Botany Bay on January 20, 1788. She reached Port Jackson on January 26.\nAt Cape Town, eight guns were taken away from the gun deck and put in the hold. This was to make room to build stalls to hold cattle. The guns were put back after the ship arrived in Sydney. They were taken out again and put into a fort at Dawes Point.\nHelping the new colony.\nIn October 1788 \"HMS Sirius\" sailed east to Cape Town to get extra food supplies. Leaving Cape Town in January 1789, she continued to travel east until she got back to Sydney in May. This eastward journey using the west winds, known as \"the Roaring Forties\" meant that the ship had sailed completely around the world. Rough seas near Tasmania smashed her figurehead and badly damaged the front of the ship.\nIn March 1790 the \"Sirius\" went to Norfolk Island to deliver more marines, convicts and supplies. She was able to unload the people, but bad weather made getting the supplies ashore impossible. Four days later Captain Hunter tried to land the supplies in Sydney Bay. The ship drifted too far into the bay and was wrecked on a reef on March 19. All the crew were rescued. Over the next two weeks most of the supplies were saved as well.\nIt was another 11 months before another ship came to Norfolk Island and took the crew back to Sydney. Hunter went back to England and an inquiry decided that the shipwreck was not his fault.\nAnchor and cannon.\nCannons from the wreck were saved in 1790. In 1795 Lieutenant-Governor Philip Gidley King gave four cannons to Captain Hogan, of the ship, \"Marquis Cornwallis\". Eight cannons were sent back to Sydney, to be used in a fort in 1804. In 1924, two cannon from the ship were put in front of the Norfolk Island court house.\nOne of \"HMS Sirius's\" 12 anchors was found at the wreck site. In 1907 it was put on show in Macquarie Place, Sydney. The anchor is in good condition although the ends of the arms were broken off while it was being brought up from the wreck. Work was done on the anchor to help keep it in good condition in 1992. The size of the anchor is long, wide and deep. Next to the anchor is one of the cannons from the \"HMS Sirius\". This was one of the cannons taken off the ship to guard Sydney back in 1788.\nIn 1983 the wreck was explored by archaeologists. In 1985 several objects were found including a carronade (a small cannon) and another anchor. In 1987 more than 600 objects were brought up from the ship. These are on show in the Maritime Museum on Norfolk Island."}

Several were checked but were not seen as suitable for the long journey to Australia. A French storeship, the \"Eclipse\", had been damaged when it ran ashore. An American ship, the \"Rattlesnake\" was not of suitable quality. The Navy purchased the British-made \"Grantham\", a packet boat, used for the quick transport of mail. When it was partly taken apart for repairs, the Navy decided it needed so much work, that it would cost too much to repair or rebuild it. They then selected the \"HM Supply\", a small Royal Navy ship based in Portsmouth, which was used to move naval stores around to the different naval yards.\nAfter the setting up of the penal colony at Port Jackson, HMS \"Supply\" made ten trips to Norfolk Island. When HMS \"Sirius\" was wrecked in 1790, the \"Supply\" was the new settlement's only ship. In April 1790 she made a trip to Batavia to get more food. She left for England in November 1791 and reached Plymouth on April 21 1792. She was sold at auction in July 1792. Renamed the \"Thomas and Nancy\" she carried coal on the Thames until 1806."}

These two extra positions were political jobs and put him into conflict with his job as a judge. As Chief Justice he had to be sure that new laws were in agreement with the laws of England. This gave him the power to veto (stop) any new law in Australia. This was not a problem while Brisbane was the Governor, but Forbes soon had problems with the new Governor, Sir Ralph Darling.\nThe Francis Forbes Society is a group set up to study Australian legal history."}

Retrieved 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenz's law is named after Emil Lenz, and it says:\nLenz's law is shown with the negative sign in Faraday's law of induction:\nwhich indicates that the induced emf (\u2130) and the change in magnetic flux (\u2202\u03a6\"B\") have opposite signs.\nThe induced emf and the resulting induced current are counterclockwise when B is directed out from the page and the area of the circuit is decreasing. The flux through this circuit is decreasing in the outward direction. Now the induced current I produces its own magnetic field, and we may use the right-hand grip rule to compute the direction of this field. The result is that the magnetic field due to the induced current is also directed outward within the circuit. It is as though nature, through this induced field, tried to compensate for the reduction in the flux due to the applied field B. This turns out experimentally to be a general rule, so that we may say that\n\"The direction of the induced emf is always such as to result in opposition to the change producing it.\"\nThat is \"Lenz's law\".\nAs another example of the application of Lenz's law, consider a coil of wire to which a battery is suddenly connected. Suppose that the battery starts a current flowing clockwise, as viewed by the observer. This current will give rise to a magnetic field whose lines will thread the coil and circle back outside it. Thus, as the current due to the battery builds up, there is a changing magnetic flux through the coil and this must result in an induced emf in the coil. What is the direction of this induced emf? Lenz's law tells us immediately that it must be counterclockwise, so as to oppose the building up of the current. Similarly, when the current in a circuit is broken, the induced emf seeks to keep the current from dying out, and this accounts for the sparking observed when switches are opened slowly. The induced emf in a circuit whose current is changing is called the \"back emf\", since it always opposes the alteration in the current. It arises from change in the current's own magnetic field, an effect referred to as \"self-inductance\".\nWere Lenz's law not true, an increase in current in a coil would result in an emf that aided the applied battery, thus increasing the current further, inducing more emf and further increases in the current, ad \"infinitum\". This would be an unstable situation and one in which the conservation of energy principle would be disobeyed.\nThis sort of reasoning may be extended to other situations in which a system in equilibrium is displaced and the principle arrived at is the following.\nWhen a system in equilibrium is disturbed, the equilibrium is displaced in the direction which tends to undo the effects of the disturbance.\nThis generalization of Lenz's law is called Le Chatelier's principle."}

It broadcasted several different children\u2019s television series. These series were all owned by Disney Media Networks, the owner of ABC Entertainment Group. Most of them were also shown on Buena Vista Television Group\u2019s own network Disney Channel. \nHistory.\nOn September 13, 1997, \"Disney's One Saturday Morning\" started out as a two-hour block on the \"ABC Saturday Morning\" lineup, and aired some of the shows that aired on it. In 1999, it was extended to 5 hours. On September 6, 1999, a spin-off, \"Disney's One Too\", aired on UPN and in syndication every weekday in the morning or afternoon and Sunday morning. \"One Saturday Morning\"' last aired on September 7, 2002.\nOn September 14, 2002, Disney renamed \"One Saturday Morning\" to ABC Kids. The block originally contained new programs, but by the end, all of ABC Kids programs became repeats of Disney Channel originals.\n\"Power Rangers\" was previously aired on Fox Kids until halfway through the \"Wild Force\" season, when \"Power Rangers\" moved to ABC Kids for the 2002 Fall season due to the Fox Family Channel/Saban Entertainment purchase by Disney in 2001. Starting with the episode \"Unfinished Business\", the remainder of the \"Wild Force\" season premiered on ABC Kids. During its time on both Fox Kids and ABC Kids the entire \"Wild Force\" season also reran later on ABC Family (in part both prior to the introduction of and during the ABC Family Action Block). The following \"Ninja Storm\" season also premiered on ABC Kids and then reran later on the ABC Family Action Block. The \"Dino Thunder\", \"S.P.D.\", \"Mystic Force\", \"Operation Overdrive\" and \"Jungle Fury\" seasons were all premiered on Jetix and then reran on ABC Kids. The \"RPM\" season and broadcasts of the first season of \"Mighty Morphin\", newly re-versioned, aired exclusively on ABC Kids.\n\"Power Rangers\" ended its run on ABC Kids on August 28, 2010, nationwide due to Haim Saban having bought back the intellectual rights to the franchise from Disney and giving airing rights to Nickelodeon in May 2010. Airings ended slightly earlier on August 14, 2010, on West coast affiliates due to a two-week preemption caused by the 2010 Little League World Series and the E/I recovery that resulted from it. On September 4, 2010, the hour held by \"Power Rangers\" was returned to the local affiliates. After its completion on ABC Kids, \"Power Rangers\" moved to Nickelodeon. All new seasons (starting with the \"Samurai\" season) began to premiere on the main Nickelodeon channel on February 7, 2011. Repeats of new seasons and all previous seasons began airing on Nicktoons on February 11, 2011.\nWith the rise of federally-mandated E/I programming guidelines, some of the network's affiliate groups, primarily Hearst Television and Allbritton Communications, refused to carry any show that did not fulfill E/I requirements (such as \"Kim Possible\" or the \"Power Rangers\" series during their time on ABC Kids) in order to instead free up time to air locally produced programming. However, some stations time shifted these shows either to very early in the morning Saturday or to Sunday, often before local news, \"Good Morning America\" and/or that week's \"live\" portion of the ABC Kids block began.\nABC Kids was aired for the final time on August 27, 2011. After that, ABC discontinued airing animated programming, making it the first not to air animated programs since September 1992, when NBC stopped airing animated programs to make room for TNBC.\n\"Litton's Weekend Adventure\".\nOn May 24, 2011, ABC announced that it had reached a deal with broadcast syndication production company Litton Entertainment to produce original content for the Saturday morning block. The \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" block launched on September 3, 2011, replacing ABC Kids."}

Star temperature can be measured by looking at its spectrum, the type of light that the star shines.\nStars are also grouped into spectral types or classes by color. In general, a star's temperature determines its color, from red to blue-white. Spectral types are named with a letter. The seven main types are \"M\", \"K\", \"G\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\" and \"O\". \"M\" stars are the coldest stars and \"O\" stars are the hottest. The full system contains other types that are hard to find: \"W\", \"R\", \"N\", and \"S\".\nThe closest star to the Earth, the sun, is a class G star.\nHarvard spectral classification.\nThe Harvard classification system is a one-dimensional classification scheme. Stars vary in surface temperature from about 2,000 to 40,000 kelvin. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest, as is done in the following table: \nNote: The conventional color description describe only the peak of the stellar spectrum. However, the actual apparent colors the eye sees are lighter than the conventional color descriptions. \nThe mass, radius, and luminosity listed for each class are appropriate only for stars on the main-sequence portion of their lives and so are not appropriate for red giants. The spectral classes O through M are subdivided by Arabic numerals (0\u20139). For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes the coolest ones. The Sun is classified as G2.\nThe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is more often used in astronomy, because it relates three important variables: the absolute magnitude, the luminosity and the surface temperature. It is as important to astronomy as the periodic table is to chemistry.\nConventional and apparent colors.\nThe \"conventional color\" descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an \"A-class star\" which is considered to be white. The \"apparent color\" descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. \nThe Sun itself is white, though it is sometimes called a yellow star. This is a natural consequence of the evolution of human optical senses: the response curve that maximizes the overall efficiency against solar illumination will by definition perceive the Sun as white, though there is some subjective variation between observers."}

It was made by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the German fairy tale \"Snow White\" by the Brothers Grimm. It is the first full-length cel animated movie and the earliest in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the movie's different sequences.\n\"Snow White\" was first shown at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. With international earnings of $8 million during its initial release, the movie for a bit had the record of highest grossing sound movie at the time. The popularity of the movie has led to it being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office.\nAt the 11th Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar. The movie was nominated for Best Musical Score. It was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1989 and is ranked in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, who also named the movie as the greatest American animated movie of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairytale has had a huge cultural impact, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.\nStory.\nAn evil queen has a mirror and asks \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\" The mirror answers \"Snow White\". Snow White is lost in the woods, and comes across the home of seven little men, or dwarves. She cleans their home, and they allow her to stay with them. The queen eventually finds out that the heart in the box is of a pig so she goes and changes herself onto an old hag. She goes to the dwarfs' cottage the next day while they're out and gets Snow White to bite into an apple with makes her fall dead. Suddenly, the dwarfs chase the old hag up a cliff and trap her. She tries to roll a boulder over them but lightning strikes and she dies. Snow White is awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince.\nProduction.\nDevelopment on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature to the \"New York Times\". Before \"Snow White\", the Disney studio had been mainly involved in the production of highly successful animated shorts in the \"Mickey Mouse\" and \"Silly Symphonies\" series. Disney hoped to enlarge his studio's reputation and money by moving into features, and estimated that \"Snow White\" could be produced for a budget of $250,000 - ten times the budget of an average \"Silly Symphony\".\nWalt Disney had to fight to get the movie produced. Both his brother Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it, and the Hollywood movie industry mockingly referred to the movie as \"Disney's Folly\" while it was in production. He even had to mortgage his house to help finance the movie's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of just over $1.5 million, a huge sum for a movie in 1937.\nCharacters.\nUnvoiced characters include Snow White's animal friends, the Queen's raven, and the vultures who follow the Witch. However, although the animals did not have human speaking voices, their natural calls were very lifelike, and were all voiced by champion whistler and animal mimic A. Purves Pullen, who would provide bird and animal calls for Disney movies (including numerous Pluto cartoons) for several decades. Pullen also produced the bird calls for the Enchanted Tiki Room attractions at Disney theme parks. During the 1940s and 1950s, he performed as \"Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath\" with the \ncomedy band Spike Jones &amp; His City Slickers.\nRelease.\n\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was first shown in cinemas on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. It has been re-released many times since. The first time was in 1944, in order to raise money for the Disney studio during World War II. This set a tradition of re-releasing Disney animated features every seven to ten years. \"Snow White\" was re-released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993.\nReception.\nDisney's wife, Lillian, told him that no one will go pay anything to see a dwarf picture. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21, 1937 to a very impressed audience, many of the same people who called the movie \"Disney's Folly.\" The movie received a prasie from many child actors audience that included Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard, Shirley Temple, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, Jack Benny, Fred MacMurray, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Burns and Allen, Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, John Barrymore, and Marlene Dietrich. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. The \"New York Times\" said \"Thank you very much, Mr. Disney.\" RKO Radio Pictures put the movie into general release on February 4, 1938, and it went on to become a huge box-office success, making more money than any other movie in 1938. In fact, for a short time, \"Snow White\" was the highest-grossing movie in American cinema history, until it was beat by \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939. When taking inflation into account, and including rereleases, the movie still remains one of the top ten American movie moneymakers of all time.\n\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the first full-length animated feature movie made in English and Technicolor (not counting the \"Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons\"), and won an Academy Award for Walt Disney as a huge movie which has charmed millions and started a great new form of entertainment. Disney won a full-size Oscar statuette and seven small ones, given to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple.\nThe movie was also nominated for Best Musical Score. \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, and Miles Davis.\nNoted moviemakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised the movie as a huge achievement in cinema. The movie inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. The 1943 \"Merrie Melodies\" short \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\", directed by Bob Clampett, parodies \"Snow White\" by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"\u2014the best ten movies in ten \"classic\" American movie genres. After polling over 1,500 people from the creative community, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was acknowledged as the best movie in the animation genre.\nTheme parks.\nSnow White's Scary Adventures is a popular theme park ride at Disneyland (an opening day attraction dating from 1955), Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. Snow White, her Prince, and the Seven Dwarfs are also featured in parades and character appearances throughout the parks.\nVideo game.\nA video game was released for the Game Boy Color system. Snow White appears in the popular PlayStation 2 game \"Kingdom Hearts\" as one of the seven fabled Princesses of Heart."}

He is played by actor John Barrowman. He was first in \"Doctor Who\" in the 2005 episode \"The Empty Child\" and is in the show throughout the rest of the 2005 series as a companion of the Ninth Doctor. Jack later becomes the main character in \"Torchwood\", an adult-themed spin-off of \"Doctor Who\". He comes back into \"Doctor Who\" in the 2007 series and he meets the Tenth Doctor, and returned again for the 2008 series.\nJack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century. A bisexual. In contrast to the wiser and older Doctor, Jack prefers a hands-on solution to the problem at hand. As a consequence of his death and being brought back in the last episode of the 2005 series of \"Doctor Who\", the character becomes immortal, which does not change during both \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\".\nCharacterisation.\n In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies got inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, Jack's original appearances in \"Doctor Who\" were thought of with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is changed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, \"Is he a force for good or ill?\"\nThe character is described as both \"lethally charming... good looking and utterly captivating\", as well as \"flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man\". Within \"Doctor Who\", Jack's personality is light-hearted, although this changes in \"Torchwood\"'s first series, where he becomes a darker character. In \"Torchwood\" Series 1, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. During The second series of \"Torchwood\", Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in \"Doctor Who\" where he was reunited with the Doctor.\nFrom the Torchwood onwards, Harkness wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman comments that \"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavor. We knew he'd be running around a lot, so I redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from \"Doctor Who\" to make it more fluid, because the real things are very weighty... The rest of Jack's costumes are loosely wartime based, so he has big wartime trousers which are getting more and more styled to suit his figure. There are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show - one hero version which is used for most scenes, one wetcoat made with a pre-shrunk fabric, a running coat which is slightly shorter so John's heels do not catch when he runs and two stunt coats - which were 'hero coats' back in Series 1.\"\nDiscussing whether his character could ever find a soulmate, John Barrowman refutes that Jack \"likes everybody, and his love for each person is different\". He believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but \"would never take that beyond infatuation\" and \"would never let the Doctor know\". Barrowman describes Jack's love for Ianto as \"lustful\", and if he ever were to settle down with him, he would \"let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side\". John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. In contrast, if he settled down with Gwen, \"he'd have to commit completely\" to her; this is why he does not act on his feelings for her, because even though she would let him flirt with other people, he could \"never afford to do anything more Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, describes theirs as a \"palpable love\" and opines that \"with Jack and Gwen, it\u2019s the real thing and they\u2019re going to make you wait for that.\" \"Torchwood\" Series Two sees Jack promise both Gwen and Ianto that they were the reason he returned to Cardiff. Barrowman claims that Jack also \"fancies\" fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her \"tenacity\" and willingness to \"spat with him\", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as \"fatherly\", stating \"He was guiding them. That's why it was so devastating for him to lose them.\" Offering reasons why Jack could never find \"The One\", Barrowman brings up the character's immortality. \"He always loses them. He outlives them. They die. He watches them get old. That bothered him in Series One [of \"Torchwood\"], but now he's come to terms with that, I think... so now he just sleeps around!\"\nIn several instances in \"Torchwood\", Jack displays no problems with killing a person of any species, which within \"Doctor Who\", allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series, he is verbally warned \"don't you dare\" when pointing a gun. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen, Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of quick revenge. Whilst the Doctor scorns Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood."}

Initially heading west-northwest, it changed direction to almost due west shortly after reaching Category 4 intensity on July 11. After spending over a day at that intensity, Fico decayed and fell back down to a mid-range Category 1 on July 14. Fico then reintensified back to Category 4 strength the next day.\nThe hurricane's strength fluctuated, but Fico stayed a major hurricane until July 17, when it entered the central Pacific as a Category 1. It slowly intensified and became a major hurricane yet again on the 21st. At this point, Fico turned to the northwest and slowly lost strength. The storm dropped to a tropical storm early on July 28, and went extratropical later that day. At a later date, the remnants were enmeshed in a frontal system which headed towards the Aleutian Islands.\nFico was a tropical cyclone for 20 days, and travelled a distance of roughly 5500\u00a0mi (9000\u00a0km), both of which were records. It was also a hurricane for 17 consecutive days. Both of Fico's records have been broken. Hurricane Tina and then Hurricane John outlasted Fico. John also outran its distance record.\nImpact.\nFico never made landfall. Despite this, it pounded the Big Island with 15-30 foot waves doing \"considerable damage\" to roads and buildings along the coast. Smaller waves also broke on the southern shores of Maui with minimal effects. Six people aboard a sloop were washed overboard and rescued, while a tugboat was driven aground on a reef at Kukuiula. A weakening Fico also caused a sharp wind gradient, producing gusty gale-force winds that blew across the islands, knocking over trees and causing power outages. Fico's extratropical remnants caused heavy rains and gales south of Cold Bay in the Aleutians.\nThe name Fico was retired after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season."}

He was king for 30 years. This time has been called the \"greatest explosion of human energy ever seen in Burma\". As king, Bayinnaung created the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. This empire included much of Burma, Manipur, Chinese Shan States (southern Yunnan), Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central and southern Thailand) and Lan Xang (Laos and northeastern Thailand).\nBayinnaung's made the Shan States part of the Burmese kingdoms. This removed the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma. This had been a concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century. The kink took control of the Shan States in 1557. He put in an administrative system that took away much of the power of the Shan saophas (chiefs). The also made changes to some of their customs to make them similar to other customs in the kingdoms. His policy for dealing with the Shan was used by all Burmese kings until the kingdom was taken control of by the British in 1885.\nHe could not use this policy everywhere in his very large empire. His empire was a group of former sovereign kingdoms. The kings of each of the kingdoms were loyal to him. He was the Cakravartin (Universal Ruler). They were not loyal to the kingdom itself. Siam left the kingdom three years after of his death in 1584. By 1599, all the sub-kingdoms had left. Bayinnaung's empire had ended.\nHe is thought to be one of the three best Burmese kings. The other two are Anawrahta and Alaungpaya. Many well known places in modern Myanmar are named after him. He is also well known in Thailand because of a popular song and book. Both are called \"Phu Chana Sip Thit\". The name means \"the Conqueror of Ten Directions.\""}

Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Ana was two kinds of storms, a \"subtropical cyclone\", and a \"tropical cyclone\". It formed as a subtropical cyclone on April 20, while it was to the west of Bermuda. It moved towards the east-southeast and began to get better organized. On April 21, the subtropical cyclone became a tropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Ana then turned towards the east-northeast. It quickly lost strength because of wind shear and a close cold front. On April 24, Ana became an extratropical cyclone. \nThe storm moved near Bermuda, while causing light rainfall. The remnants of the storm also dropped rain in the Azores and the United Kingdom. Stormy sea waters caused by the storm capsized a boat near Florida coastline. The incident killed two people.\nMeteorological history.\nA low pressure area formed to the south, and southwest, of Bermuda on April 18. A trough, which is a type of weather system, brought an area of clouds into the low pressure system. The low pressure system moved towards the north. After turning towards the northwest, the weather system looped southeastward. Thunderstorm activity became stronger near the center of the cyclone. The storm was named Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, while located about 250\u00a0miles (400\u00a0km) west of Bermuda.\nThe subtropical storm moved to the east-southeastward and it continued to get stronger. It is estimated that Ana became a tropical storm by 0000\u00a0UTC on April 21. When it became a tropical cyclone, Ana reached its highest winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Shortly after, Ana came close to Bermuda. Strong wind shear began to remove a lot of the thunderstorm activity from Ana. Ana continued to move eastward, and early on April 22, the wind shear again removed the thunderstorms from the center of the storm. After turning towards the northeast, the core of Ana merged with a cold front on April 24. Because of t his, Tropical Storm Ana turned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the cyclone sped towards the east-northeastward, before it died out on April 27.\nImpact, records, and naming.\nBefore Ana was formed, the government of Bermuda declared a gale warning for the island. When Ana formed, a tropical storm warning was also issued for Bermuda. The storm moved close to Bermuda and dropped 2.63\u00a0inches (67\u00a0mm) of rainfall the Bermuda International Airport. The winds on the island were light. \nStormy seas from the storm reached the coast of Florida in the United States. A couple of factors, which included the stormy seas, caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet. Two people on the ship drowned, and the others were rescued. The remnants of Ana dropped 0.87\u00a0inches (22\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Clouds from the remnants of Ana also caused rain in the United Kingdom. Two ships experienced tropical storm force winds because of Ana.\nAna was the second subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in the month of April. When the storm became a tropical cyclone, it was also the first Atlantic tropical storm in the month of April. Because the damage from Ana was not bad, the name \"Ana\" was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization. The name Ana was used again in 2009."}

{"id": "144917", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144917", "title": "Syrian Americans", "text": "Syrian Americans are citizens of the United States of Syrian ancestry or nationality. This ethnic group includes first generation immigrants, and descendants of Syrians who immigrated to the United States. It is believed that Syrians first arrived in the United States in large number in 1880. Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in New York, Boston, and Detroit. Immigration from Syria to the United States was stopped for a long time after the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which made it difficult.\nMore than forty years later, the Immigration Act of 1965, removed the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States increased very much. It is estimated that 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States between 1961 and 2000.\nMost of the Syrian immigrants to the US from 1880 to 1960 were Christian; a small minority were Jewish, Muslim Syrians arrived in the United States mostly after 1965. According to the United States 2000 Census, there were 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry, about 12% of the Arab population in the United States.\nHistory.\nIt is believed that the first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from Greater Syria in the 1880s and worked as peddlers, selling linen and other similar types of goods. Before 1920, the area now known as Syria was actually part of Greater Syria, an area which included the four modern countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Syria itself. Most immigrants from the region were classified as \"Syrian,\" even though they were not ethnic Syrian; some were even registered as Syrian Turks as Syria was under Ottoman rule for 400 years. This makes difficulties in trying to work out how many Syrians arrived in the early years.\nMost of the early Syrian immigrants came from Christian villages around Mount Lebanon. According to historian Philip Hitti, approximately 90,000 \"Syrians\" arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919. An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo, which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916. Early immigrants settled mainly in northeastern United States, in the cities of New York City, Boston and Detroit and the Paterson, New Jersey area.\nAccording to the United States 2000 Census, there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States. New York City has the biggest concentration of Syrian Americans in the United States. Other urban areas, including Boston, Dearborn, New Orleans, Toledo, Cedar Rapids, and Houston have large Syrian populations. Syrian Americans are also numerous in Southern California (i.e. the Los Angeles and San Diego areas) and Arizona.\nAssimilation.\nPre-1965.\nThe first Syrian immigrants to the United States wore traditional clothing, this along with the fact that they tended to work as peddlers, led to some xenophobia. Dr. A. J. McLaughlin, the United States health officer at Marine Hospital, described Syrians as \"parasites in their peddling habits.\" U.S. authorities claimed that Syrians had no right to become naturalized because they were Asian and did not belong to the white race. However, Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new culture. Immigrants Anglicized their names, adopted the English language and common Christian denominations.\nSyrians did not stay together in urban areas; many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were in contact with Americans on a daily basis. This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland. Also military service during World War I and World War II helped assimilation. Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized.\nAfter 1965.\nAfter 1965 Immigration was mostly Muslim, and unlike their Christian counterparts they found it a bit harder assimilating because of their Islamic faith and the anti-assimilationist trend in America of the 1960s and 1970s. Also they are fond of their identity as Arabs, which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism to respect their Islamic religious customs and traditions in the United States.\nLanguage.\nSyrians are mainly Arabic speakers. While some may speak the formal literary Arabic, many Syrians speak Syrian Arabic, a dialect which belongs to the Levantine Arabic family of dialects. There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from Aleppo have a distinct accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from Homs or Al-Hasakah. Syrians can usually understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic.\nMany old Syrian American families no longer speak Arabic because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English \"very well\". Throughout the United States, there are schools which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some Eastern Orthodox churches which hold Arabic services. Also to note Syria and Lebanon were briefly under French rule between 1918 and 1943 when they obtained independence, so many Syrian Americans are familiar with the French language."}

This current and the voltage causes an electromagnetic or radio signal to be radiated. Being more specific, a dipole is usually an antenna that uses a resonant length of conductor. This conductor is cut so it can be connected to the what is sending the signal. For resonance, the length of the conductor is an odd number of half wavelengths long. In most cases a single half-wavelength is used.\nLength of a dipole antenna.\nThe length of a dipole is very important for selecting the frequency that the antenna will work at. The antenna is an electrical half wavelength, or multiple of half wavelengths. This is not the same length as the wavelength for a signal travelling through air. There are a number of reasons for this. This means that an antenna will be a small amount shorter than the length calculated for a wave moving in air.\nFor a half wave dipole, the length for a wave moving in air is calculated. This number is multiplied by a factor \"A\". \"A\" is normally between 0.96 and 0.98. It is affected by the ratio of the length of the antenna to the thickness of the wire or tube used poles.\nUses of dipole antennas.\nDipole antennas are used for many different things. These include television antennas (commonly referred to as \"rabbit ears\"), shortwave radio antennas and whip antennas."}

A comparator is used to offer level triggers correct down to microvolts with reaction times in the picoseconds. Analog filters offer anti-aliasing in sampled value systems as inputs and outputs, and can be used as pre-filters in audio and communications. Analog multipliers and dividers are used to offer brief gain control, radiometric function, or continuous energy measurement, with surprising accuracy. Over-voltage protection applications can protect the front-end of analog transmission/receiver systems, multiplexers. Amplification and filtering for noise removal are the main feature of analog signal processing."}

The 'resonant' cavity magnetron type of the earlier magnetron tube was invented by John Randall and Harry Boot in 1940. The high power of pulses from the cavity magnetron made centimetre-band radar practical. Shorter wavelength radars allowed the finding of smaller objects. The small cavity magnetron tube made the size of radar sets much smaller so that they could be put into in aircraft and ships used to find submarines. At present, cavity magnetrons are commonly used in microwave ovens and in various radar applications."}

There are also provincial languages, Balochi language, Pashto, Saraiki, Sindhi and Punjabi, and one semi-provincial language Koshur (Kashmiri language).\nPakistan is heir to one of the most ancient civilizations in the world along with Iraq and Egypt, which also had ancient indigenous languages before being replaced by their present-day languages. These primary languages have not been used in the domains of power because the rulers of these regions were generally foreigners. But the foreigners, whether the Persians, ancient Greeks, Arabs, Turco-Mongols as well as the British, have all enriched the indigenous languages so that their vocabulary is multilingual and varied. As the people of these areas converted to Islam, Arabic and Persian words influenced and became part of their identity, and remain so. In a sense, it is their very presence, as well as the Arabic-based scripts of all 75 Pakistani languages, which gave them a cultural unity. Linguistically, Pakistan is almost entirely Indo-Iranic as it's languages belong to the Indo-Iranic family of languages. Its scripture and vocabulary owe very much so to Arabic and based on Farsi (which also derived it's own script from Arabic).

The main part of forensic psychology is working with the criminal justice system.\nForensic psychology is the use of psychological practices and principles and applying them to the legal system, mainly in court. In 1893 James McKeen Cattell at Columbia University was the first to research and study the psychology of testimony. \nThe American Psychological Association Council of Representatives in 2001 recognized Forensic psychology as a specialty. A broad definition for forensic psychology includes two parts. The first part is to research human behavior that is and/or can be related to the legal process. The second is the use of psychological practice to consult on and within the legal system, including both criminal and civil law. \nThe public part of a forensic psychologist\u2019s time is spent in a courtroom working as a witness for the court. They answer questions based on interviews and discussions with people suspected of a crime. One aspect of a forensic psychologist is to give evidence as to the suspect\u2019s ability to stand trial. Another is to give their thoughts about the accused's state of mind at the time of the offense. At sentencing, a forensic psychologist may give evidence of mitigating circumstances arising from the accused's condition at the time.\nMajor roles.\nForensic psychology has some major roles in a court that bring psychology into a legal arena. The first is \"malingering\" a defendant is pretending to have a mental illness, or is lying to the court about his state of mind. A forensic psychologist keeps in mind that a defendant may have a mental disorder but also keeps in mind to watch for signs of deception, or errors in the defendant\u2019s story. Another job of a forensic psychologist is to investigate the state of mind of the defendant at the time he or she committed the crime. Another is to see whether or not the defendant is able to be charged with the crimes due to his or her mental condition. Another job is to evaluate the defendant to see if he or she is able to be rehabilitated, or if they might commit the crime again.\nHistory of forensic psychology.\nThe branch of psychology known as Forensic psychology has been in existence for a little over 50 years. This branch of psychology has gone through many changes throughout the years.\nThese changes have been possible due to a development in different ways to assess psychological factors. These assessments are used in courtrooms in order to work to understand behaviors which are criminal or abnormal. These tests include but are not limited to: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Rorschach Ink Blot Test and The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. \nThe ancient Greeks and Romans were the ones to first introduce the concept of insanity to the law. One of the first cases was Rex v. Arnold in 1723 in which Edward Arnold \"Mad Ned\" shot and injured Lord Onslow. As a result, Edward Arnold was found guilty and sentenced to death. But, Lord Onslow was not satisfied with this decision and said instead he should remain in prison for life. The judge ruled in his favor and that the behavior after the crime was admissible. This ruling set the stage for future trials to consider medical testimony and examinations performed after the crime. \nRorschach ink blot test.\nThe Rorschach Ink Blot Test was developed in the 1930s by a man named Hermann Rorschach. With this test, subjects were shown an ambiguous blot of ink on a page and were asked to describe what they see. Based on the response of the subject, they are then evaluated using a scale which can then provide inferences about their personality characteristics as well as emotional functioning. Based on the contributions of this test, it has been used in multiple court proceedings including but not limited to criminal, civil, domestic, and quasi-legal. "}

It is \"the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen\". \nThe idea of an opportunity cost was first begun by John Stuart Mill. The utility has to be more than the opportunity cost for it to be a good choice in economics.\nFor example, opportunity cost is how much leisure time we give up to work. Because leisure and income are both valued, we have to decide whether to work, or do what we want. Going to work implies more income but less leisure. Staying at home is more leisure yet less income.\nAnother example is deciding to stop work to go back to university. By choosing to go to university, your opportunity cost is losing your job and your pay check. Even though going back to university has a big opportunity cost, many people think it is a good decision because increased education gives you more job opportunities.\nAnd in the other words Opportunity Cost can be termed as cost of forgone alternatives or cost of shifting from one opportunity to the other."}

A winner of playoff plays with 1st team in the pennant race. This is called Korean series. This is 4 out of 7. (If a team wins 4 games first, that team becomes the team of that year.) In Korean league, there is also all star game like major league baseball(MLB)in America. KBO manages all of these games.\nOrganizaion.\nThe president of KBO is Gu boneneung in 2011.

This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground, or loses its charge quickly by a discharge. Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated. A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see, feel and even hear the spark. This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized. This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor (for example a path to ground). Other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge.\nHistory.\nIn Greek age, Thales found static electricity when he was cleaning his amber. But at that time, they did not pay attention to this and research it. They just knew that rubbing something made a pulling force. Earnest research into static electricity was started in the 17th century, when Otto Von Guericke made the first friction generator. And in the 18th century, Coulomb started research into a fixed quantity of static electricity. Benjamin Franklin associated static electricity with storms. In 1832 Michael Faraday published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricity. This report proved that the electricity made by using a magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same. Since Faraday's result, the history of static electricity can be thought as the study of electricity in general.\nCharge.\nMany situations can cause static electricity.\nDischarge.\nStatic discharge is excess charge that is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings. Positive charges get \nelectrons from the surroundings, and negative charges lose their electrons to the surroundings.\nThe feeling of a static electric shock is caused by the stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. Due to the presence of much water in the body, the charge is generally not enough to cause a dangerously high current. Lightning is also an example of static discharge. A cloud gets a very huge charge by clashing with other clouds. It gives off the excess charge to the ground. But this huge charge never occurs in the human's surroundings naturally, unless he is struck by the lightning.\nDespite the apparently harmless nature of static electricity, there can be significant risks in research, because a large charge can break down the equipment."}

Much like hours on a clock, which repeat every twelve hours, once the numbers reach a certain value, called the \"modulus\", they go back to zero.\nIn general, given a modulus \"formula_1\", we can do addition, subtraction and multiplication on the set formula_2 in a way that \"wrap around\" \"formula_1\". This set is sometimes represented by the symbol formula_4, and called the set of integers modulo \"formula_1\".\nPeople talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures. For instance, the Chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old. The modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nCongruence.\nModular arithmetic can be used to show the idea of congruence. In general, given a positive integer \"n\", two integers \"a\" and \"b\" are congruent modulo n, if they have the same remainder when both are divided by \"n\". Congruence can be written this way:\nThe number \"n\" is called the modulus. Another definition of congruence, that means the same thing but is sometimes more useful, is that the two integers are congruent modulo n if the difference (\"a\" - \"b\") is an integer multiple of \"n\". That is, if \"n\" is a factor of (\"a\" - \"b\"), then \"a\" and \"b\" are congruent mod \"n\".\nFor example:\nThe remainder when 32 is divided by 7 is 4, and the remainder when 11 is divided by 7 is also 4. This tells us that they are congruent\u2014when the modulus is 7.\nWe can use this example with the other definition too. The difference, (\"a\" - \"b\"), is 32 - 11 = 21. This shows the two numbers are congruent, because 21 = 3 \u00d7 7 and 7 is a factor of 21.\nUses.\nModular arithmetic is useful in many fields, and its applications include RSA algorithm in cryptography, primality testing in computer science, and 12-tone arithmetic in music. It is often used in calculating checksums and check digits."}

They have very large male reproductive organs, and are also the fastest at swimming underwater among the penguins, reaching speeds of 36\u00a0kilometers per hour.\nLife.\nGentoo penguins generally live on Antarctic islands, with their largest colony on the Falkland Islands. There are approximately 320,000 breeding pairs of gentoo penguins.\nThese penguins nest on the ground, making nests of stones, sticks, grass, feathers, and various other materials. They usually lay two eggs by mid-October, which hatch in about 34 days, and put equal care into caring for either chick. Young chicks remain in the nest for 3 to 4 weeks until their second down feathers grow in, during which their parents hunt for food in order to feed them. Afterward, they leave the nest but remain in the colony in groups of chicks, called creches that free their parents to hunt for food for them.\nGentoo penguin pairs often stay together for a long period of time.\nGentoo penguins usually eat crustaceans, such as krill, but genrally eat what is easiest to get. At sea, they may be under attack from sea lions, leopard seals, and orcas. While on land they have no natural predators, but skua, gulls, and other birds of prey have been known to attack and eat young chicks and eggs."}

They are the suborder Megachiroptera, family Pteropodidae of the order Chiroptera (bats).\nThese fruit bats are flying mammals that live in dense forests in Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia. There are about 166 species of fruit bats. Fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes. These bats live in huge colonies, known as \"camps.\" These nocturnal (most active at night) animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet. \nPollination and seed dispersal.\nAs fruit bats fly from plant to plant getting food, they also pollinate the plants they visit. In addition, they disperse the plants' seeds as they eat. Many plants, including some avocados, dates, mangos, and peaches, are dependent on these bats for either pollination or seed dispersal.\nSenses and diet.\nFruit bats mostly eat fruit juice and flower nectar. They chew the fruit, then spit out the seeds, peel, and pulp. Fruit bats, like other Megachiropteran bats, use the sense of smell to find their food, fruit and/or nectar. Although they have large eyes and can see well, fruit bats do not use sight as their primary sense. Fruit bats eat other things too.\nCarriers of Ebola virus.\nSome megabats are vectors of dangerous diseases.\nThe first recorded human outbreak of Ebola virus was in 1976, but the source of the virus is still unknown. Recent tests have shown that some species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks show the bats have the virus, but do not show any signs of it. Further studies also show that Ebola can reproduce in fruit bats and other bats in the 'Tadarida' genus. This could mean that the bats are the source of the virus. The Marburg virus, which is related to Ebola, has also been found in fruit bats in Uganda.\nAnother explanation is that fruit bats could be an intermediate host because of the uncertainty that fruit bats are the index case for Ebola. It is also important to note that certain species of fruit bats in Africa are immune to the Ebola virus and that their DNA or RNA are similar to the Zaire Ebola virus. This could explain the spread to humans since people in that region tend to eat fruit bats.\nCarriers of other viruses.\nFlying foxes in Australia are known to carry two infections which can pose a serious risk to human health - Australian bat lyssavirus and hendra virus (\"Henipavirus\"). These bat-borne diseases, unique to Queensland, are among the deadliest viruses in the Western world. Although rare, these illnesses continue to mystify medical professionals. These bat-borne diseases are almost always fatal. Human infections with these viruses are fortunately very rare. \nHendra virus is a virus that mainly infects megabats (large fruit bats, or \u2018flying foxes\u2019) which can be passed on to horses. Like ebola and marburg, hendra is a haemorrhagic fever with high to very high mortality (50-90%). Both ebola and marburg virus have been associated with megabats as infectious vectors. \nIt is thought that horses contract the Hendra virus by ingesting food or water contaminated with infected megabat body fluids and excretions. The virus can be deadly to both humans and horses. When there is no handling or direct physical contact with flying foxes, there is negligible public health risk.\nOnly three people are known to have survived the bat-borne Hendra virus.\nSo far more than half of all people who have contracted Hendra virus died within six weeks, however there have been no survivors of a second Queensland bat-borne disease. In 1994 lyssavirus - a close relative of rabies virus - was first discovered in a flying fox showing symptoms near Ballina, NSW (which lies on the border with Queensland). Lyssavirus has killed the only three people to have ever contracted it. "}

Because a mother gray whale would defend her calf so fiercely it would actually attack whalers and overturn their boats, whalers often called the gray whale a devilfish. \nThe gray whale migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods. Gray whales are very agile swimmers. They can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet (155 m) deep. Gray whales make grunts, clicks, and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales.\nDiet.\nThis giant cetacean eats small fish, crustaceans, squid, and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor. It sieves its food through its comb-like plates of baleen.\nDescription.\nCompared to most baleen whales, gray whales are rather small, growing to be only about 45 feet long. They are easy to see with their gray mottled color, which is actually more charcoal black than it is gray. Gray whales have barnacles and lice on their skin. \nWhales prefer one fin over the other, just like humans are right-handed or left-handed. It is possible to see whether a gray whale is left-fineed or right-finned. The fin that has least barnacles is the fin it uses most. This is because the whale likes to dive down to the ocean floor to scoop up huge amounts of sand from the bottom, filtering out small prey animals that live in it. When the whale does this, many of the barnacles on the side that rubbed along the bottom are scraped off. So, whichever side has fewest barnacles is the side the whale prefers to use when it digs up sand.\nMigration.\nGray whales migrate on both sides of the Americas. One route is a really long migration from the Arctic Ocean (northwest of Alaska) to the coast of Mexico, and back each year. They travel about 20,000 km (~12,500 miles) each year, staying near the coast. They feed in the cold Arctic waters and calve and mate in the warm, protected tropical lagoons of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.\nTraveling night and day, the gray whale averages approximately per day at an average speed of . This round trip of is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal.\nAs they migrate, they may be preyed upon by pods of killer whales (\"Orca\"). This has been recorded in the cold current running down west of California."}

{"id": "145556", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145556", "title": "Basking shark", "text": "The basking shark (\"Cetorhinus maximus\") is a huge filter-feeding shark, which can grow up to the length of 40 feet (12 metres). It is the second largest shark in the world (after the whale shark). The basking shark is also called the sunfish, the bone shark, the elephant shark, the sailfish shark, and the big mouth shark.\nDescription.\nThe basking shark is one of the most recognizable species of all sharks. Its large size and extended gill slits which nearly encircle the head and caudal fin together, helps distinguish it from all other species. It has a snout which is in the shape of a cone, and it has many large gill rakers made for filter feeding. Its enormous mouth extends past the small eyes and contains many small, hooked teeth. The basking shark has a very large liver that makes up to 25% of its body weight. The liver is high in squalene, a low-density hydrocarbon that helps the shark float and not sink.\nThe dorsal surface of the basking shark is mainly a greyish-brown colour, but can range from dark grey to almost black. The underside is usually the same colour, but is often paler and more whiter.\nThe basking shark has many hundreds of tiny teeth. Those teeth which are in the center of the jaws are low and triangular while those on the sides are more cone-shaped and slightly recurved. There is mainly a wide space on the center of the upper jaw which only has scattered teeth. \nThe basking shark is the second largest shark in the world, only to be behind the Whale shark. The basking shark can reach lengths of up to 40 feet (12 metres), but the average adult length is 22\u201329 feet (6.6-8.7 m). The size at birth is believed to be between 5\u20136 feet (1.5-1.8 metres). The basking shark is an extremely slow-growing species and may grow to 16\u201320 feet (4.8\u20136 metres) before becoming mature.\nHabitat.\nThe basking shark is a coastal-pelagic species, found throughout the world's arctic and temperate waters. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from Newfoundland to Florida, and southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic it ranges from Iceland and Norway to Senegal, including the parts of the Mediterranean. In the western Pacific, it is found off Japan, China and the Koreas as well as western and southern Australia and the coastlines of New Zealand. In the eastern Pacific, it is found from the Gulf of Alaska to the Gulf of California and from Ecuador to Chile.\nBehaviour.\nBasking sharks are usually found travelling in pairs or groups of up to 100 or more, but are sometimes seen travelling alone. It is not fully understood why they have such a different behaviour to other shark species, as they seem to travel alone and in groups. They are highly migrational, and in the winter months they will be harder to find as they go to the deeper parts of the water to find food.\nWhen they are seen swimming in circles, it is believed that this is to get the attention of females for mating. They may spend hours performing this, just in order to get noticed. They are usually very patient when it comes to attracting a mate.\nFeeding.\nAlong with the Whale shark and the Megamouth shark, the basking shark is one of three species of large, filter-feeding sharks. However, the basking shark is the only one that relies on the flow of water through its pharynx by swimming. The basking shark is usually seen swimming with its mouth wide open, taking in a continuous flow of water. Food is strained from the water by gill rakers in the gill slits. The basking shark's gill rakers can strain up to 2000 tons of water per hour. These sharks feed along areas that contain high densities of large zooplankton (i.e., small crustaceans, invertebrate larvae, and fish eggs and larvae). There is a theory that the basking shark feeds on the surface when plankton is common, then sheds its gill rakers and hibernates in deeper water during winter. Also, it has been suggested that the basking shark turns to benthic (near bottom) feeding when it loses its gill rakers. It is not known how often it sheds these gill rakers or how quickly they are replaced.\nReproduction.\nBasking sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the young embryos develop in a yolk sac inside of the female, but they aren\u2019t attached to a placental connection. It is believed that the females can delay gestation so that they may remain pregnant from 1 to 3 years. Mating occurs in the early summer and the females often move to very shallow water when ready for the young to be born. She may have up to 6 pups that are up to 6 feet long. The age of maturity is from 6 to 13 years. Basking sharks start mating when they are around 15 to 20 feet long.\nMigration.\nBasking sharks are highly migratory. Off the Atlantic coast of North America, it appears in the southern part of its range (North Carolina to New York) in the spring, shifts northward (New England and Canada) in the summer, and disappears in autumn and winter. Off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom, in the northeast Atlantic, the basking shark feeds at the surface of coastal waters during the summer. These sharks are absent from November to March, suggesting a migration beyond the continental shelf during the winter months. This is explained by the high amount of zooplankton (the main food of the basking shark) that exists in these waters during late spring and early summer. During migration, basking sharks form groups depending on size and gender.\nParasites.\nMany people have witnessed individual basking sharks leaping from the water. This behaviour is not fully understood, but some believe that the shark may be trying to get rid of parasites or commensals such as remoras and sea lampreys, which are often seen attached to the skin of the basking shark. The lamprey cannot cut through the denticle-armored skin, but they may be enough of an irritant to cause a reaction like jumping or rubbing against an object to get rid of them. The cookiecutter shark has also been known to attack basking sharks by using its suction cup-like lips and muscular pharynx to drill off pieces of flesh on the outside of the shark.\nConservation.\nThe basking shark has been hunted for its large liver, which has been sold in Japan, and has been burned and used in lamps by fishermen in the U.K, whilst the oil has been used in the manufacture of cosmetics. Due to the long amount of time it takes to mature, and the slow reproductive rate, the basking shark is vulnerable to over-fishing, and targeted populations are very slow to recover from targeted fisheries. Today the biggest threat comes from the demand for the fins for shark fin soup, and from accidental by-catches in the fishing industries. Although it is difficult to tell exactly, there has been a report that the population of basking sharks has decreased by 80% since 1950."}

Nora became a hurricane in a favorable environment September 18 while moving northwest. Its motion then stalled over an upwelling of cooler water that weakened it.\nOn September 20, Nora again started moving. It reached its peak intensity of 115 knots and 950 mb On September 21 and 22 it moved over the wake of Hurricane Linda. This weakened the storm pack down to a Category 1.\nDuring this time, a trough developed that turned Nora to the northeast. This carried Nora over a favorable environment and towards Baja California. After restrengthening slightly, Nora made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Punta Eugenia and again south of San Fernando, both times as a hurricane.\nNora stayed a tropical storm as it moved into the United States. Yuma reported sustained gale-force winds. Rains were heavy, sometimes exceeding the \"annual\" rainfall for the area. Nora weakened to a depression while over California, and it dissipated September 26.\nNora killed two people in Mexico. One was killed by a downed power line in Mexicali, and the other was a scuba diving in underwater currents. No one in the United States was directly killed by Nora. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed several traffic accident deaths to the weather.\nThere was extensive damage to areas hit by Nora. Waves ruined dozens of homes. Roughly 350 to 400 people were left homeless in San Felipe, and winds uprooted trees and peeled roofs from homes in Puerto Pe\u00f1asco.\nIn the United States, thousands were left without power in California and Arizona, and 16 telephone poles were downed in Seeley. Streets flooded in San Diego, Indio, El Centro, and Palm Springs. A remnant circulation continued aloft, and damaged trees and three homes in Utah. Total damages were \"several hundred million dollars\", as well as 40 million dollars to lemon trees.\nNora crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near Bah\u00eda Tortugas, Baja California Sur. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60\u00a0miles (95\u00a0km) south-southeast of San Fernando, Baja California.\nAt landfall, a trough was accelerating Nora northwards, causing it to reach a forward speed of 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later, while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\nOn September 24, Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull activated an emergency response center to prepare the state's response to the flash flooding the storm would cause on the dry desert floor, and Yuma residents began to fill approximately 55,000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding. Hull also activated the state's National Guard, and sent drinking water and electric generators to Yuma. Farther inland, the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona, southeastern California, southwestern Colorado, southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26.\nIn the United States, there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern California to the weather.\nDamage totals in the United States are not fully known, although media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, and at least one study places the figure at $150\u2013200\u00a0million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30\u201340\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.\nThe Yuma radar indicated a small area of rainfall totals along the northern Gulf of California coast of Baja California. In the United States, the largest total rainfall was recorded at the Harquahala Mountains in Arizona, where of rainfall were recorded as a result of Nora, causing flash floods in western Arizona.\nNear Phoenix, rainfall from the storm caused the Narrows Dam, a small earthen dam, to fail. In other locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah, more than occurred in a few localized areas, sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall. Flooding was also reported in Somerton, San Diego, El Centro, Palm Springs and Indio, while 12,000\u00a0people lost power in Yuma, as well as Los Angeles and southwestern Utah.\nDespite the damage, the World Meteorological Organization did not retire the name \"Nora\" during its meeting in the spring of 1998. As a result, it was used in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season and is on the list of names to be used in 2009."}

Chess boxing fights have been done since early 2003. The sport was started when Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, given the idea by a similar sport in the writing of Enki Bilal, started actual matches. The sport has become more well known since then. To do well at chess boxing, players must be both good chess players and good boxers.\nStructure and rules.\nA match between two players is made up of up to 11 rounds of boxing and chess sessions, starting with a four-minute chess round followed by two minutes of boxing and so on. Between rounds there is a one-minute pause, during which the players change their gear. The form of chess played is rapid chess in which each player has a total of twelve minutes for the whole game. Players may win by knocking out the other player, checkmate, a judge's choice, or if the other player runs out of chess time. If a player does not make a move in the round of chess, he will be given a warning by the referee and he must then make a move in the next 10 seconds.\nHistory.\nThe idea was started in 1992 by cartoonist Enki Bilal, and a match of chess boxing was a big story part of his graphic novel \"Froid \u00c9quateur\". Iepe Rubingh, a Dutch artist, was took the idea from Bilal's book and started the sport in the spring of 2001. Rubingh decided that the method of play in the book, a boxing match with a chess match after, was not very good. Rubingh made the rules so a round of chess would come after a round of boxing.\nThe World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO), keeps control of the sport.

The town is built on the banks of the Boorowa River, which flows into the Lachlan River. The town was first called \"Burrowa\". Boorowa and Burrowa are Aboriginal words in the Wiradjuri language meaning \"birds\". In 2008, there were 1350 living in Boorowa.\nThe first people to live in the area were the Wiraduri people. This was one of the largest tribes in New South Wales. They had several regular camping sites along the Lachlan and Boorowa Rivers. It is estimated that there were several thousand Wiradjuri people at the time of European settlement. A survey in 1851 showed that there were only 300 people left. Local Wiradjuri people were forced onto government reserves at Rye Park and Edgerton.\nEarly settlement.\nIt is not known for sure who the first European explorers were in this area. Hamilton Hume and his neighbour, William Broughton, had explored the Yass area in 1821. They may have gone farther towards the Lachlan. Broughton had one of the first farms on the Boorowa River in 1828. By 1849, he had of land in the area. Other early settlers were James Hassall in 1827. His family already had large farms at Cowra by 1823. His brother Tom Hassal, a clergyman and his wife Ann Marsden (daughter of Reverend Samuel Marsden) and other family members were given land in 1831. There was a law at the time which gave free land to the children of clergy.\nIrish influence.\nMany of the settlers in Boorowa were from Ireland and the town shows their influence. Two early settlers in the 1820s were cousins, Roger Corcoran and Ned Ryan. They had been sent to Australia as convicts. Saint Patrick's Church, built in 1877 has a huge stained glass window brought from Ireland in 1881. It shows Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847) the \"Liberator of Ireland.\" The oldest building still standing in Boorowa is Shamrock Cottage, built in 1850, once the home of the owner of the Queens Arms Hotel.\nOld buildings.\nThere are many old buildings still standing in Boorowa. Webb and Crego's store, built in 1862, was robbed by bushranger Ben Hall in 1863. The Royal Hotel, built in 1860, is still a hotel although it is now called the Ram and Stallion Hotel. The Court House, built in 1884, is now an information centre for tourists."}

He showed great talent as a young man and might have become one of England\u2019s greatest composers if he had lived longer. He was killed while fighting in World War I. He is best known for a group of songs which are settings of poems by A. E. Housman.\nEarly years.\nButterworth was born in London. His father was a solicitor who later became the general manager of the North Eastern Railway. The family moved to Yorkshire soon after George\u2019s birth. He had his first music lessons from his mother, who was a singer, He soon started to compose music. His father wanted him to be a solicitor and so he sent his son to Eton College. From there he went to Trinity College, Oxford. At Oxford he became more and more involved with music, especially after he met the folk song collector Cecil Sharp and composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams. Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs. Both of them were influenced by English folk songs when they were composing. Butterworth was also a very good folk dancer. He was particularly fond of Morris dancing.\nVaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends. It was Butterworth who said to Vaughan Williams that it would be a good idea to turn the symphonic poem he was working on into his \"London Symphony\". When the manuscript for that piece was lost in the post Butterworth and two other musicians helped Vaughan Williams to write it out again. Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworth's memory after his death. When he left Oxford, Butterworth became a music critic for \"The Times\" as well as composing and teaching at Radley College, Oxfordshire. He also studied at the Royal College of Music for a short time, working with people such as Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford.\nFirst World War.\nAlthough Butterworth had lots of work he often felt that his life had no purpose. When World War I broke out, Butterworth felt that he could be useful so he joined the British Army. He was killed by a sniper in 1916 at Pozi\u00e8res leading a raid during the Battle of the Somme. His body was not found, and his name appears on the Thiepval memorial, near the site of the Somme. He was awarded the Military Cross, and a trench was named after him.\nA Shropshire Lad.\nButterworth did not write a great deal of music, and during the war he destroyed many of his compositions that he thought were not good enough. Of those that survive, his works based on A. E. Housman's collection of poems \"A Shropshire Lad\" are the best known. Many English composers of Butterworth's time set Housman's poetry, including Ralph Vaughan Williams.\nButterworth wrote two song cycles on Housman's poems. They include some of the best-loved English songs of the 20th century, especially \"Is My Team Ploughing?\" and \"Loveliest of Trees\". He used this last song as the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody, also called \"A Shropshire Lad\". It is full of soft, tender music as well as passion.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie, 1980, ."}

His father was a very successful lawyer who was also interested in music. He played the cello and sang. Stanford\u2019s mother played the piano. The young boy heard a lot of music at his home as there were often visitors who came to make music. Charles studied the piano, organ and composition and was composing and performing at concerts when he was still very young.\nHis parents had wanted their son to be a lawyer, but it was obvious that music was to be his profession. He won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1870 where he was a choral scholar. He learned very quickly and in 1873, while he was still a student, he was made organist of Trinity College and conductor of two choirs. While he had these jobs he was given time to make visits to Germany where he studied with Carl Reinecke and Friedrich Kiel. He met several famous composers including Brahms and Offenbach. He went to the opening of the Bayreuth Festival Theatre where the music of Richard Wagner was performed.\nStanford took his BA degree in 1874 and MA in 1878, and was given the honorary degree of D.Mus. at Oxford in 1883 and at Cambridge in 1888. He had a lot of energy and was known for working very hard. When the Royal College of Music opened in London in 1883 Stanford was made professor there. He became conductor of the Bach Choir and then he was made professor of music at Cambridge. He was still only 35 years old. He kept these two professorships until his death. Although he gave up his job as organist at Trinity he became conductor of the Leeds Triennial Festival and appeared with nearly every important British music festival. In 1902 he was knighted.\nStanford married in 1878 and the couple had two children.\nStanford died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nMusic.\nStanford is best known today for the choral music he wrote for the Anglican church. These includes some very fine anthems and motets as well as service settings. His music was much better than most of the church music that had been composed during the 19th century, so he helped to make British music better. He composed many pieces for music festivals: these include oratorios and cantatas as well as partsongs and solo songs. He also wrote a lot of orchestral and instrumental works. These often show the influence of Brahms and Schumann.\nAs a teacher of composition Stanford had a great deal of influence on many British composers. He sometimes had a bad temper, but he was also very good at showing students how they could improve their music. Composers such as Charles Wood, Constant Lambert, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Rutland Boughton, John Ireland, Frank Bridge, George Butterworth, Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells, Arthur Benjamin and Ernest J. Moeran all learned a great deal from him, and continued to admire him.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie, 1980. "}

Oryxes have a life span of about 20 years.\nSome people think that the unicorn of legend was based upon the oryx.\nMany types of oryxes (including the Arabian oryx and the scimitar-horned oryx) are endangered species, mostly because of overhunting and disease. \nDiet and Water.\nThe Oryx is an herbivore (a plant-eater). It eats grasses, shrubs and roots, spending most of its time grazing. Oryx are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. After a while, they regurgitate a partly-digested \"cud\" which they chew and then swallow for the last time.\nThis desert animal can go for weeks without water; it gets much of its water from the plants it eats.

The composer Sterndale Bennett conducted an orchestra and choir at the opening performance.\nAlthough \u201ctriennial\u201d means something that happens every three years, the next festival did not happen until 1874. In 1880 the first festival called the Leeds Triennial Festival was conducted by Arthur Sullivan. These festivals were very famous internationally because a lot of famous composers were asked to write new works for choir and to come and conduct them. Composers such as Raff, Dvorak, Massenet, Humperdinck, Parry, Stanford, Elgar and Sullivan himself all wrote new works for the festival.\nLater in the 20th century many famous musicians continued to be associated with the festival including Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland.\nAlthough the last Leeds Triennial Festival took place in 1985 both the Festival Chorus and the Leeds Philharmonic Chorus continue to perform at the Leeds International Concert Season in the Town Hall."}

His father was an Irish clergyman. Ernest spent most of his childhood living on the coast of Norfolk. He learned to play the violin and the piano. At first he was taught at home by a governess. When he was ten he went to school. In 1908, he went to Uppingham School where he spent five years. When he left school in 1913 he started to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music with Charles Villiers Stanford.\nWar service.\nMoeran\u2019s studies at the Royal College of Music were interrupted after 18 months because of the start of World War I. He joined the army as a despatch rider but he was soon badly injured in the head and could no longer fight in the army. After the war he did some music teaching, but then he started to study music again. His teacher this time was John Ireland who had been a pupil of Moeran\u2019s earlier teacher Stanford.\nComposing music.\nAfter these studies his music started to be performed a lot. His \"First Rhapsody\" for orchestra was performed several times, including in 1924 by the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty. He was asked to compose a symphony for the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, but he preferred to write shorter pieces, especially chamber music and piano music. In 1931 he wrote a \"String Trio\" which is one of his best works. \nMoeran became interested in folk music. He liked to go to country pubs and listen to the people singing there. He collected about 150 folk songs in Norfolk and Suffolk and made many arrangements of them.\nBy the mid-1920s, Moeran had become close friends with Peter Warlock. They lived together and often went out drinking together. Moeran gradually became an alcoholic.\nIn 1945, after Warlock had died, Moeran married the cellist Peers Coetmore. The marriage was not very happy although it helped Moeran to compose some of his best pieces: the \"Cello Concerto\" and \"Cello Sonata\".\nMoeran was found drowned in the River Kenmare. At first people thought he had committed suicide but then it was found that he had had a heart attack and died before he fell into the water.\nHis music.\nMoeran\u2019s music is influenced by folk song. His harmonies are often like those of Delius. He was also influenced by Vaughan Williams, Holst, Bax, John Ireland and Peter Warlock. For many years he concentrated on piano music, songs and chamber music, but in his later years he wrote larger works such as the Symphony in G minor (1934-7) and his Concertos for the Violin and the Cello."}

In the 20th century they usually rode motorcycles.

It allows the holographer to make a more exact image than with photography. The holograph seems to move and change slightly to look as if it were three-dimensional. Holography uses the wave aspect of light. \nHow a hologram is made.\nHolograms are made with light flashed onto a plate or screen, almost like how photos are made. To make a hologram instead of a photograph, some of the light, called a \"reference beam,\" has to go directly to the screen. The light has to be a laser because lasers are more accurate and have a wavelength that does not change the way the wavelengths of light from other sources does, like light from lightbulbs. To stop other light from ruining the hologram, holograms are usually taken in the dark. Because even the tiniest vibration can stop the hologram from forming properly, the tables upon which that the holographer places the equipment may be built with shocks or inflated chambers to stop vibrations from the floor.\nHolograms vs. photographs.\nHolograms can be compared to photos. Holography records both the intensity of light, like photography, but also records the difference in the phase of light. Holography records all of information from the light that the object reflects.\nFunctionality.\nHolography uses a reference wave (which goes onto the plate) and an exposure wave (object wave, which comes from the object). The reference wave can save the phase information as patterns of light and dark on a film. The object wave and reference wave must have the same wavelength in order to save the phase information and they usually come from the same laser.\nHistory.\nThe most famous person in the history of holography is the physician Dennis G\u00e1bor, the inventor of the hologram.\nIn 1947, he was trying to improve microscopes, and he figured out how to display three-dimensional objects.\nPhysical details.\nRecording.\nHolograms need laser beams. A dispersing lens makes the beam bigger and then it goes through a special mirror. Only a piece of this laser beam can go through the mirror. Then this beam becomes the reference wave, and it is recorded on the film. The other piece of the laser beam is reflected off of the mirror. This piece becomes the exposure wave at the object. The object reflects this wave on the film.\nReconstruction.\nMaking a hologram is very similar to making a photograph, and it needs chemicals.\nTo look at a hologram the film must be lit up with the reference wave. These waves are reflected on the film (hologram) and create a virtual picture of the recorded object, even if that picture can only be seen from a specific angle.\nApplications.\nMeasurement.\nIndustries use holograms to measure things. In the car industry, cars are measured using holography so engineers can see bulges and vibration characteristics. Phase-shift holography is one kind of holography used to make cars.\nThe first step in making a hologram is to examine the ground level state of the object, then overload the object through heat or mechanical pressure. Covering the original hologram and the modified hologram can produce interference fringes. By measuring the interference fringes, engineers learn how big the deformation or other problem is. Engineers can measure tiny terminal expansions or vibrations in mechanical systems. This needs two reference waves.\nData storage.\nThere are holographic storage machines for analog pictures and digital data. Digital information will be affiliated by a two-dimensional bit-pattern."}

When he was two years old his father died. His mother married again and went back to live in Wales, where she came from. Philip went to school at Eton College.\nHe was still a teenager when he was introduced to the composer Delius, who lived in France.

He studied in Germany for a time, and then at Oxford where he studied classics. He learned about music by teaching himself. He did not fight in World War I. He was a conscientious objector, but also, his health was not good enough for him to be in the army.\nHe spent most of his life in London, but he did visit Ireland for a year, and also spent three years with his mother in Wales, and four years in Kent where he lived with Ernest Moeran. Heseltine and Moeran often got drunk together. He became friends with the composer Bernard van Dieren whose music influenced him a lot.

A plumber is someone who fixes or puts in piping systems, plumbing fixtures and equipment such as water heaters. Many plumbers are construction workers. The plumbing industry is an important part of every developed economy because people need clean water and safe ways to move and store waste.\nPlumbing also refers to a system of pipes and fixtures put in a building to move water and the get rid of waste that is in water. Plumbing is different from water and sewage systems because plumbing system serves one building, while water and sewage systems serve a group of buildings or a city.\nHistory.\nPlumbing was very rare until modern cities grew in the 19th century. At about the same time, public health leaders began wanting better systems to get rid of waste. Before this, people got rid of waste by collecting it and dumping it onto the ground or into rivers. However, there were some plumbing pipes in the city settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization by 2700 B.C. Plumbing was also used during the ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations as they built public baths and needed drinking water, and somewhere to drain waste. The Romans used pipe inscriptions to stop people from stealing water. \nThese systems did not improve much over the years. There were almost no improvements from the time of the Roman aqueducts and sewers until the 19th century. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems got rid of open sewage ditches and cesspools. Most large cities today send solid wastes through pipes to sewage treatment plants. Treatment separates water from waste and makes the water more pure before it goes into streams or other bodies of water. Most places stopped using lead for drinking water after World War II because of the dangers of lead poisoning. At this time, copper piping was started because it was safer than using lead pipes.\nMaterials.\nWater systems in ancient times used gravity to move water. They used pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo or stone. Today, water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes are now made of copper, brass, plastic, or other nontoxic material. Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, and lead. Lead is not used in pipes today because it can be poisonous.\nThe 'straight' sections of plumbing systems are of pipe or tube. A pipe is usually made by casting or welding, where a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe usually has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, where tubes have thinner walls, and needs special joining techniques such as 'brazing', 'compression fitting', 'crimping', or for plastics, 'solvent welding'.\nAs well as the straight pipe or tubing, many fittings are required in plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions.\nPlumbing fixtures are designed for the people who use the water. Some examples of fixtures include water closets (also known as toilets), urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility and kitchen sinks, drinking fountains, ice makers, humidifiers, air washers, fountains, and eye wash stations.\nRegulation.\nMuch of the plumbing work in places where many people live is done under government rules. Putting in plumbing and fixing plumbing generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the people who live or work in the buildings."}

It is the centre of Young Shire. It is on the Olympic Highway. It is about 2 hours drive from Canberra. Young is in a valley surrounded by hills. In 2001 there were 6,821 people living in Young.\nYoung is known as the Cherry Capital Of Australia and every year hosts the National Cherry Festival.\nHistory.\n The indigenous people of the district were members of the Burrowmunditory tribe, part of the Wiradjuri people.\nJames White was the first European settler in the area. He started Burrangong Station (farm) in 1826 by taking an area of 100 square miles.\nGold was found in the area in 1860. Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat. This was an area where sheep were grazed before the gold rush. The town was officially listed in 1861. About 470,000 ounces of gold were sent by the armed gold escort from the goldfields. Up to 20,000 miners were digging for gold including about 2,000 Chinese miners.\nFrom November 1860 through to June 1861 European miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area. This is now known as the Lambing Flat riots. As gold became harder to find, European miners got upset that the Chinese miners were still finding gold. Many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. They were chased off the goldfields. Eventually the riots were stopped and the Chinese miners had their mining areas given back. The New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill. This put a limit on the number of Chinese that could come to New South Wales on any ship. They also had to pay a tax to come New South Wales.\nIn 1889 Young was the first country town in Australia to have electricity for the streets and houses. Young was the first Local Government Area to start a country school bus system in New South Wales\nEducation.\nThere are seven schools in Young:\nThe Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens.\nYoung Shire Council has started these gardens next to Chinaman\u2019s Dam. This is an old railway dam about 4\u00a0km south of Young. They are made to create a peaceful feeling like the Japanese garden at Cowra.\nChinaman\u2019s Dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedeman. They used the water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. In the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site. It is in a small gully called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully.\nIn 1882 the NSW government started to build the first part of the Blayney to Demondrille railway line. To provide water for the steam trains, they decided to use the dam and pump water from it to a tank, known as Young Tank, at the 246 mile post. It is not known whether the railways improved the old dam or built a new one.\nFrom 1885 to 1901, trains stopped at Young Tank to refill with water. In 1901, trains were able to get water at Young Railway Station. The supply of water came from Chinaman\u2019s Dam. The size of the dam was enlarged in 1911 to hold about 2 million gallons.\nThe dam was a popular spot for swimming.\nWhen the town water supply was connected to the Burrinjuck Dam, the railways stopped using Chinaman\u2019s Dam. In 1937 the area turned into a 36-acre park. The Shire Council looks after the gardens. The dam has since been made bigger."}

During the Constitutional Convention many, including George Mason, Elbridge Gerry and James Wilson felt the courts could decide if a law was unconstitutional, and if so, refuse to enforce it. Other founding fathers including John Francis Mercer, Gouverneur Morris and John Dickinson argued against allowing judges to have that power. The issue was left unanswered. However, when deciding that a new law needed the approval of the president, all attempts to have the judiciary approve new laws were soundly defeated. Judicial Nullification is sometimes used to mean jury nullification. More often it means nullifying a law, legal code or statute by a member of the judiciary.\nIn 1832 South Carolina said a new tariff law was unconstitutional, thus not really a law. Vice President John C. Calhoun agreed, but President Andrew Jackson disagreed. Jackson threatened to send troops. The two sides negotiated. Congress changed the tariff, and South Carolina decided the new law was not against the Constitution.\nIn 2011 the Supreme Court made a ruling that, in essence, says lower court judges can ignore the law.

In England quite a lot of young children who lived in the country, a long way from good schools, had a governess. When the boys were old enough they were sent away to a boarding school.\nGovernesses taught basic skills such as Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. They may also have taught other skills such as French, piano playing and drawing or painting. Sometimes other teachers might be \nA governess was not a household worker, but she was not treated like a member of the family either. This meant that they were often quite lonely, and they usually ate their meals alone. For girls from a middle class background who were not married it was one of the only ways of earning a living. When the children she taught (her \"charges\") grew up, she would have to find a new job.\nNovels of the time were usually about rich families, and a governess often comes into the story, e.g. in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" or Anne Bront\u00eb's \"Agnes Grey\".

Lambert was often ill when he was a child. He went to school at Christ's Hospital and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He soon became interested in French and Russian music. He became friends with other famous people including the Sitwell family, William Walton, Philip Heseltine and Bernard van Dieren. He and Edith Sitwell were the reciters at a performance of Walton\u2019s \"Fa\u00e7ade\".\nLambert was a prodigy: he was composing music for orchestra when he was only 13, and when he was 20 he was asked to write a ballet for Serge Diaghilev's world-famous Ballets Russes (\"Romeo and Juliet\"). \nHe soon became very famous. His best known work is \"The Rio Grande\" for piano solo, chorus and orchestra. It has a mixture of musical styles: jazz, habaneras and the influence of Delius and Duke Ellington.\nDuring the 1930s he performed a lot as a conductor with the Vic-Wells Ballet (later the Royal Ballet), but he stopped composing music. Lambert thought he had failed as a composer, and only finished two more big works in the last sixteen years of his life. He continued conducting, and appeared at Covent Garden and in BBC broadcasts, and travelled to Europe and America conducting ballets. He was an excellent ballet conductor and helped the dancers to give their best performance.\nDuring the war he became ill. He refused to see a doctor. He was working very hard and also drinking a lot.\nLambert liked jazz and thought it was an important influence on popular culture of the time. He wrote a book about this, called \"Music Ho!\" (1934). The book is widely read today, although it shows a very personal approach to music.\nLambert was married twice. His first marriage was to Florence Kaye. He later married Isabel Nichols, an artist, in 1947. After Constant Lambert's death, Isabel married the composer Alan Rawsthorne. \nLambert died on 21 August 1951. He had pneumonia and it was also found that he had diabetes made worse by alcoholism. "}

His black father was a doctor from Sierra Leone, his mother was English. His parents were not married. The father went back to Africa by February 1875. He had the job of coroner for the British Empire in the Gambia in the late 1890s. He did not know anything about his son\u2019s existence.\nColeridge-Taylor was brought up in Croydon . He studied the violin at the Royal College of Music and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1899 he married Jessie Walmisley who had been a student with him at the RCM. Her parents did not want her to be married to someone of mixed race. The couple had a son, Hiawatha (1900-1980) and a daughter, Avril, born Gwendolyn (1903-1998).\nSoon Coleridge-Taylor became known as a composer. Edward Elgar helped him get one of his pieces performed at the Three Choirs Festival. Two months later Stanford conducted the cantata \"Hiawatha\u2019s Wedding Feast\", the piece for which he is best remembered. He toured the United States in 1904. This made him even more interested in finding out about his racial heritage. He wanted to do for African music what Johannes Brahms had done for Hungarian music and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k for Bohemian music. He had met the American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar in London and set some of his poems to music. Several people encouraged him to learn more about his heritage.\nColeridge-Taylor was a shy man, but he was a very good conductor. He was often asked to adjudicate at music festivals.\nColeridge-Taylor was 37 when he died of pneumonia. His widow hardly had any money, but King George V gave her a pension of GB\u00a3100, which shows how popular Coleridge-Taylor had been as a composer. A memorial concert was held later in 1912 at the Royal Albert Hall and gathered \u00a3300.\nColeridge-Taylor's works were often performed by Sir Malcolm Sargent who conducted ten seasons of a costumed ballet version of \"Hiawatha\" at the Royal Albert Hall between 1928 and 1939 with the Royal Choral Society (600 to 800 singers) and 200 dancers.\nHis music.\nColeridge-Taylor's best-known work is his cantata \"Hiawatha's Wedding-feast\", which was performed very often by choral groups in England during his lifetime and for many years after his death. He wrote several other pieces about Hiawatha: \"The Death of Minnehaha\", \"Overture to The Song of Hiawatha\" and \"Hiawatha's Departure\".\nHe also wrote a lot of chamber music, anthems and other works. The orchestral piece \"Petite Suite de Concert\" used to be very popular, but its Romanticism sounds a little old-fashioned now.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed Stanley Sadie; "}

After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the weather system became a cyclone. An approaching trough pushed the system across Florida. A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center, Jack Beven, said that \"as it [the storm] moved out into the Bahamas, it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm.\" He also noted that because of the uncertainty, the National Hurricane Center did not call the weather system a tropical cyclone.\nThe cyclone was said to be a \"hybrid\" storm. The cyclone quickly gained strength in warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and because of cold air over the United States. The system continued to become stronger while moving within the Gulf Stream. The storm developed central atmospheric convection, which is unusual for a storm of its type. Extratropical cyclone. Also, the system developed an eye, which is usually seen in tropical cyclones. Even though the cyclone showed signs of a tropical storm, forecaster Jack Beven stated: \"There was no front associated with it [the storm] and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150\u00a0nautical miles [175\u00a0mi, 280\u00a0km], so under the standard NHC criteria it didn\u2019t qualify as a tropical storm.\" On December 23 and 24, the nor'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970|mb. Another low pressure system that developed behind the storm became stronger, and grew to be larger in size than the original storm. Due to the Fujiwhara effect, the large circulation of the secondary low moved the original nor'easter towards the northwest. The nor'easter passed along the south shore of Long Island, and it made landfall near New York City on December 24. Later, it moved over southeastern New York State. On December 25, which is Christmas Day, the system began to lose strength as it moved towards Nova Scotia, before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea early on December 26."}

The German opera composer Richard Wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly. He had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed, and he thought that there was no opera house in Germany that was good enough for performances of his operas. Today it is still the place where every year there is a festival, the Bayreuth Festival, which is dedicated only to the operas of Richard Wagner.\nKing Ludwig II of Bavaria was a great admirer of Richard Wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built. Wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted. Work on the building started on 22 May 1872 (Wagner's birthday), and it was ready four years later when, for the first time, all four operas which make up the cycle called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"), were performed.\nThe opera house is big enough for an audience of 1,925. One unusual thing is the orchestra pit, which is right under the stage, covered by a hood, so that the orchestra cannot be seen at all by the audience. Wagner wanted the audience to be able to concentrate properly on the action on the stage instead of being distracted by watching the orchestra. It makes it very difficult for the orchestra and the singers to be together, and conductors have to get used to the problem.\nThe Festspielhaus also has a double proscenium, which makes it look as if the stage is farther away than it actually is."}

It is in the Blayney Shire. In 2006, 218 people lived in Carcoar. It next to the Mid-Western Highway, west of Sydney and south west of Bathurst. It is above sea-level. Carcoar is in a small green valley, with the town on both sides of the Belubula River.\nCarcoar was once one of the most important government centres in Western New South Wales. The town has been classified by the National Trust. This is because it has a lot of buildings from the 1800s. Carcoar is a Aboriginal word from the Gundungura people meaning either \"frog\" or \"kookaburra\".\nNearby towns are Blayney, Millthorpe, Mandurama, Neville, Lyndhurst and Barry.\nHistory.\nSettlers.\nThe first people to live in the area were the Gundungura people. The first Europen to travel through the area was surveyor George Evans. He came from Bathurst in 1815 and set up his camp on Coombing Creek.\nThe first settlers arrived in 1821. The first official land grant, 560 acres (2.3\u00a0km\u00b2), was given to Thomas Icely on 26 May 1829. He named his farm \"Coombing Park\". In 1838 Thomas Icely asked that a village be started to supply items for his big farm. On 29 September 1839 Carcoar became the third town west of the Blue Mountains.\nThe first land for houses in the town were sold in 1840. By 1850 Carcoar was the second biggest town west of the mountains. It was second in size to Bathurst. It became a banking and government centre for the area. In 1857 the town's public school opened. It is one of the oldest schools in Australia.\nWhen gold was found in the west in the 1860s, Carcoar became less important. The government began building a number of important buildings in the late 1870s. At this time, \"Coombing Park\" was supplying iron ore to the Lithgow steelworks.\nRailways.\nBecause the town is at the bottom of a steep valley it wasn't suitable for the railway. The railway line went to Blayney north west in 1874. By the early 1880s many people had left the town. Carcoar was joined to the railway line in 1888 when the Blayney-Demondrille Line.\nIn the 1980s train services were stopped between Cowra and Blayney. This included included Carcoar. This section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway. The LVR run tourist trains, mainly from Cowra to Blayney and Canowindra. They have now moved into general freight haulage.\nConvicts and bushrangers.\nCarcoar's was often visited by escaped convicts and bushrangers. They came into the town and robbed many times.\nIn one robbery, German Charley tried to stop Mickey Bourke from stealing a racehorse from the \"Coombing Park\" stables. He was shot dead by Bourke. Another bushranger, Curran was captured by the local police. The government sent extra police and a magistrate to the town. Frank Gardiner was working in the area after six years gaol for stealing horses. He gave up farm work and started stealing cattle.\nIn 1863 Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally tried to rob the Commercial Bank. This may be Australia's first daylight bank robbery. Both bushrangers ran away when a bank worker fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank.\nThe Presbyterian Reverend James Adam was held up by Ben Hall. Hall liked the Adam and didn't rob him.\nMovies and television.\nThe town has been used as a location for many movie and television productions. They include:"}

They sing the music of many composers, not just Johann Sebastian Bach.\nHistory.\nThe Bach Choir gave its first concert on 26 April 1876 with a performance of Bach\u2019s \"Mass in B minor\". At this time more and more people in England were becoming interested in the music of Bach, but the \"Mass in B minor\" had never been performed in England. The conductor Otto Goldschmidt conducted the concert, and afterwards the Choir's committee decided to make The Bach Choir a permanent choir. Otto Goldschmidt was appointed as the Musical Director.\nIn those days all choir members came from rich families (the upper classes). New members had to pass an audition, but they also had to be \u201cproposed\u201d (recommended) by existing members and accepted by the committee. Queen Victoria became Patron of the choir in 1879. The Choir sang music by lots of different composers as well as Bach\u2019s motets, church music and the \"Mass in B minor\". \nGoldschmidt resigned in 1885 and Charles Villiers Stanford became conductor. Stanford had already become well known as organist of Trinity College, Cambridge and conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society. He widened the repertoire of the Choir, and the concerts also included works for orchestra. Hubert Parry composed his popular anthem \"Blest Pair of Sirens\" for the choir to sing at the Golden Jubilee of the Queen in 1887. The Jubilee concert also included the first London performance of Berlioz's \"Te Deum\", a work dedicated to the late Prince Consort. \n20th century.\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century changes were made, including regular auditions for existing choir members, and stopping the requirement for new members to be proposed. Henry Walford Davies became the conductor. He improved the choir which was then taken over by Hugh Allen in 1908. \nHugh Allen found himself conducting a choir which included the young Ralph Vaughan Williams, who had joined in 1903 and Adrian Boult, who joined around 1914. Allen was strict, but good, and during his time as conductor the Choir gave many important first London performances including Vaughan Williams' \"Toward the Unknown Region\" and \"A Sea Symphony\" and Parry's \"Songs of Farewell\". \nWhen Allen resigned in 1921 his place was taken by Ralph Vaughan Williams who had by then become a famous composer. He had a gentler approach than Allen. He stayed until 1928 when he left to be able to work more on composition. In his place the Choir appointed Gustav Holst, but he became ill and was never able to take up his post. Instead, Adrian Boult took over for three years. During his time it became tradition to perform Bach\u2019s \"St Matthew Passion\" every year. This tradition continues today.\nBoult was replaced by Reginald Jacques (pronounced: \u201cJakes\u201d), who had been a pupil of Hugh Allen at Oxford. Jacques stayed until 1960. He managed to keep the Choir going through World War II, and the annual Carol Concerts became part of their tradition. They made a recording of the \"St Matthew Passion\" which filled 42 sides of the old 78 rpm. gramophone records.\nJacques was followed by David Willcocks who led the Choir almost to the end of the century. He broadened the Choir\u2019s repertoire, and they gave the first London concert hall performance of Britten's War Requiem, conducted by Britten himself, with Galina Vishnevskaya, Peter Pears and Tom Krause (who replaced Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau at the last minute) as soloists. The Choir then recorded the work and this recording sold more than 200,000 copies in the first five months. Willcocks took the Choir on tours to many parts of the world. His last performance was in 1998.\nThe Choir today.\nToday the Choir is conducted by David Hill. As well as spending much of his time with The Bach Choir, he is also conductor of the BBC Singers. The choir continues to do new things, such as giving world premieres of new music, as well as keeping up the tradition of performing the \"St Matthew Passion\" every spring at the Royal Festival Hall. \nReferences.\nBasil Keen: \"The Bach Choir - The First Hundred Years\" (Ashgate)"}

He is regarded as one of the great French musicians of the Baroque.\nMarais, the son of a poor shoe maker, was educated in a choir school were he was taught to play the viol. He then learnt from Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, a famous bass viol player. In six months he was said to be better than his teacher. In 1675, aged 19, he joined the orchestra of the Paris Opera. This was where he met Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was the director of the Opera. Lully taught him to compose music. Marais often conducted the operas Lully had written.\nMarais was hired as a musician in 1676 to play at the royal court of Versailles. He did quite well as court musician. In 1679 he was appointed \"ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole\", a title he kept until 1725.\nHe was a master of the basse de viol. He wrote a lot of music for that instrument, he was the most important French composer for it. He wrote five books of \"Pi\u00e8ces de viole\" (1686-1725). Most of the pieces in the book are suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who \"founded and firmly established the empire of the viol\" (Hubert Le Blanc, 1740). His other works include a book of \"Pi\u00e8ces en trio\" (1692) and four operas (1693-1709). \"Alcyone\" (1706) is well known for its storm scene. Marais became the conductor of the Paris Opera in 1706, but after the failure of his 1709 opera, \"S\u00e9m\u00e9l\u00e9\" he gradually withdrew from public life. He married Catherine d'Amicourt, on 21 September 1676. They had 19 children together. Two of the children, Vincent Marais and Roland Marais also became famous musicians, as well as his grandson, Nicolas Marais.\nTiton du Tillet wrote about Marais in his book \"Le Parnasse fran\u00e7ois\". He describes a piece from Marais' fourth book called \"The Labyrinth\", which goes through lots of keys. The notes which are often dissonant, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, describe a man caught in a labyrinth. Eventually the man comes out of it happily and the music finishes with a gracious and natural chaconne. Another piece called \"La Gamme\" [The Scale], very gradually goes up the steps of the octave and then down again.\nFacsimiles of all five books of Marais' \"Pi\u00e8ces de viole\" are published by \u00c9ditions J.M. Fuzeau. A complete critical edition of his instrumental works in seven volumes, edited by John Hsu, is published by Broude Brothers.\nReferences in Film.\nMarais and his music were featured in the movie \"Tous les matins du monde\" (1991). The movie shows a detailed, imagined life of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. Marais' music is heard a lot, including his longer work \"Sonnerie de Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve du Mont-de-Paris\" (1723). A recording of the Sonnerie performed on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the cult classic film \"Liquid Sky\"."}

It is not far from the border with East Sussex. It is 38\u00a0miles\u00a0(62\u00a0km) south of London, 10\u00a0miles\u00a0(16\u00a0km) north of Brighton and Hove, and 29\u00a0miles\u00a0(47\u00a0km) east-northeast of the county town of Chichester. It had a population of 28,803 at the time of the 2001 Census. Other nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the north and Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, to the east.\nBurgess Hill is mainly situated just on the West Sussex side of the border dividing the two counties. Parts of the town are across the county boundary in East Sussex.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAlthough a Roman road was built joining London to the South coast and passing through what is now Burgess Hill, there is no evidence that the Romans settled in the area.\nFrom the fourteenth century or earlier the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24th June and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913.\nWith the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway, however, those in the business soon realised that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways. Most of the animal trading business began to revolve around rail side markets such as those at Hassocks, Haywards Heath and Lewes train stations. By the start of the 20th century, the animal trading business had all but left the Burgess Hill area.\n1700 to 1900.\nBy the early seventeenth century there was a lot of small brick and tile making companies and during this time pieces of common land were given for house building and small businesses. By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two drinking houses were established on the common. Brickmaking by hand still happened until very recently, by Keymer Tiles (formerly the Keymer Brick and Tile company) whose tiles can be found in buildings such as St. James Church, Piccadilly and Manchester Central Station (now G-Mex).\nThe growth of Brighton in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries brought in professional people looking for places to live. Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from a small rural settlement to a town of 4,500 residents.\nIn 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local household name Edwin Street, a well-known farmer and butcher. The gardens were opened in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and contained a large lake, and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster, known as a switchback . The lake was used for boating in the summer, and skating in the winter. The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street, a man of 23 stone, before being used in the winter. This area is now the Victoria Business Park.\n1900 to present day.\nThe town gradually grew bigger, having its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961, when the population of about 7,000 residents almost doubled. This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the south-east. By 1956, the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed, and has since expanded. It now contains the local headquarters of two large international companies. In 1986 a smaller industrial estate to in the north of the town developed, known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate. Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks.\nHousing estates played their part in building up the population of Burgess Hill throughout the second half of the 20th century; in the west of the town they provided a wide mix of new residents; many of them young families and the Folders Lane estate more families settled, along with some richer residents.\nThe next substantial development was Priory Village in the south west of Burgess Hill, sometimes known as the Tesco estate, due to its proximity to the supermarket. Again, this brought in a mix of incomes, again, many of them young families.\nIt must be noted that as well as the aforementioned developments, there have been two council estates built in the town - one close to Cants Lane, in the town's north east, and the area around Denham Road in the west, both of course adding to the ever rising population of the town.\nAlthough now part of the town, World's End, to the north of the town, was originally a separate community. It still retains its own shops and community association, and is served by Wivelsfield railway station.\nGovernance.\nBurgess Hill has a Conservative member of parliament.\nEducation.\nThere are ten schools for children aged up to 11 years and four schools for children aged 11\u201316/18.\nReligious sites.\nThere are a total of 9 churches and a Christian centre in Burgess Hill.\nBurgess Hill is also home to the Mid Sussex Christian Centre.\nRecreation.\nIn the town centre there is a large park (St. John's), and many other smaller recreation grounds around the town. There is a substantial leisure centre on the northern edge of Burgess Hill named the Triangle.\nSport.\nBurgess Hill Town Football Club plays football (soccer)and plays its home games at Leylands Park. Burgess Hill Rugby Football Club, or The Sussex All Blacks, are the local Rugby Football club.\nThere is also a Squash Club that plays at the Triangle Leisure Centre every Saturday and Monday, and has a team that plays in the East Sussex County League.\nThere is also a Running Club that meet at the Burgess Hill School for Girls every Wednesday evening. Members compete in local and national charity and fun races.\nThe Skate Park in the centre of town provides sporting opportunities, and holds an annual competition.\nThe Triangle (or Olympos Burgess Hill as it has been rechristened) is one of the venues in the South East supporting the London 2012 Olympic Games, and will serve as a base and training centre for teams from around the globe.\nTown Twinning.\nBurgess Hill's twin towns are:\nA square in Schmallenberg has been named Burgess Hill Platz."}

He is particularly remembered for his \"Piano Concerto\" and for his church music, especially the anthem \"Greater love hath no man\", the song \"The Holy Boy\" and the hymn tune to \"My song is love unknown\". He had an unhappy childhood, and he always felt unsure of himself and rather lonely.\nLife.\nJohn Ireland was born in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. His father, who was 70 years old, was a publisher who owned a newspaper. He had married for a second time after his wife had died, and John was the youngest of five children from the second marriage. His mother was 30 years younger than her husband. When John was 14 his mother died, and his father died the next year.\nJohn Ireland studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music. Later he also had composition lessons from Charles Villiers Stanford. He later became a teacher at the College himself. His pupils included the composers Alan Bush and\nGeoffrey Bush (who were not related), Ernest Moeran and Benjamin Britten. Geoffrey Bush later helped to prepare a lot of Ireland\u2019s works for publication. Ireland mostly made his living as an organist and choirmaster.\nIreland enjoyed going to the Channel Islands. He liked the landscapes there. He was evacuated from them just before the German invasion during World War II.\nJohn Ireland married once, but his marriage only lasted a few months.\nOn 10 September 1949, his 70th birthday was celebrated in a special Prom concert. The soloist in the \"Piano Concerto\" was the pianist Eileen Joyce, who later made the first gramophone recording of the concerto.\nIreland retired in 1953. He moved to a tiny village in Sussex, where he lived in an old windmill which had been changed into a home.\nHe died aged 82 in Washington, Sussex of heart failure.\nMusic.\nJohn Ireland was never much influenced by folksong like many other English composers of his time. His music is more related to Impressionism. He liked the music of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel as well as Igor Stravinsky and Bart\u00f3k. His \"Piano Concerto\" is one of his best works. It shows that he developed his own personal style of harmony. Most of his other good works are short pieces, including many for piano solo. His best-known piece is the song \"The Holy Boy\". It is heard in many different arrangements. His songs to poems by A. E. Housman, Thomas Hardy, Christina Rossetti, John Masefield, Rupert Brooke and others, are among some of the best English art songs.. He also wrote hymns, carols, and other sacred choral music; among choirs he is probably best known for the anthem \"Greater love hath no man\", often sung in services that remember the victims of war. Another choral work, \"These things shall be\" expresses his deepest hopes for mankind, although in his last years he said that he hated the work."}

One of his teachers was Charles Villiers Stanford. He played the viola in several string quartets and conducted many orchestras. He learned difficult music very quickly, and sometimes Henry Wood asked him to take his place when he was not well enough to conduct himself. After a while he spent most of his time composing. He privately taught several pupils, including Benjamin Britten, who later helped to make his teacher's music better known and honoured him in his \"Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge\" for string orchestra (1937), based on a theme from the second of Bridge's \"Three Idylls for String Quartet\" (1906). \nBridge died in Eastbourne.\nMusic.\nBridge\u2019s early works show the influence of Johannes Brahms and Charles Villiers Stanford. He wrote some excellent chamber music and songs. The \"Phantasie Quartet\" and the \"String Quartet no 1\" show his talent. His later pieces such as the third (1926) and fourth (1937) string quartets have quite complicated harmonies and show his interest in the music of Schoenberg as well as the harmonies of Maurice Ravel and Alexander Scriabin. His most important orchestral works include \"The Sea\" and \"Summer\". He wrote some lovely chamber music for the cello as well as many songs. In his later years his harmonies become quite advanced, for example a favourite chord of his can be found by playing a C minor chord and a D major chord together. In his longer pieces the speed of the music often changes and he avoids repeating himself exactly. \nFor a long time after his death his music was hardly ever played, but more recently musicians have discovered the greatness of his compositions. Pianists like to play the popular piano piece called \"Rosemary\"."}

There are different ways in which it can be done. The easiest way to do it is to find an example where the theory should apply, but somehow does not. As an example: Swans are birds related to ducks and geese. Today, several species of swans are known. For most people in Europe, a swan is a large white bird: The only species of swan that occurs in Europe is white. Several hundred years back, people in Europe therefore thought that all Swans were white. In 1697, the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh found black birds that looked like swans, during an expedition on the shores of Swan River, in Australia. Later, it turned out these birds were indeed swans. With his discovery, de Vlamingh had falsified the theory that all Swans were white. \nThere are some special cases, where a statement or theory cannot be falsified: \nFalsification is to prove that a theory is wrong. This is done in the following way: There is a set of statements (which are logically sound, and do not contradict each other) called theory. If a single logical statement can be found, which is also logically sound, and which contradicts one of the statements in the theory, then the theory is proven wrong. This can be done with observation, as in the example with the Swans above. It can also be done using mathematical logic, using induction.\nKarl Popper had the opinion that only theories that are falsifiable are scientific. Falsifiability is then a line between science and other kinds of knowledge: if it can be refuted, it is science; it if cannot, then it is not science. Many working scientists think Popper was right.\nNot everyone agreed with this: Pierre Duhem and Paul Feyerabend had different ideas. Feyerabend's \"Against method\" (1975) argued that there was no one scientific method. Instead, \"whatever works, works\" and \"anything goes\". This is called \"epistemological anarchy\". \nDuhem's idea was more subtle. He thought that for any given set of observations there is a huge and uncountable number of explanations. According to Duhem, an experiment in physics is not just an observation, but an interpretation of observations by means of a theoretical framework. Furthermore, no matter how well one constructs one's experiment, it is impossible to subject an isolated single hypothesis to an experimental test. Instead, it is a whole interlocking group of hypotheses, background assumptions, and theories that is tested. This thesis has come to be known as holism. According to Duhem, it makes crucial experiments impossible."}

It is measured in joules of energy per unit kelvin. Entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics.\nImagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy. If the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized, then the molecules can do ten units of work. However, if the energy became less organized (so, the entropy increased), the molecules might only be able to do six units of work, even though they still have ten units of energy in them.\nWhen total entropy is reached, there is no more energy to spend. A good example of this is a cup of hot tea. The tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in. Over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room. The tea will become colder. This is because the energy (heat) in the tea moves to the surrounding area. Once the tea became cold, there is no more heat that can be spread. The tea has reached total entropy.\nThere are two types of these \"rooms\": An \"open system\" and a \"closed system\". An open system means that energy (like heat) can freely flow in and out of the room. A closed system means that the room is closed off from the outside; no energy can go in or out.\nIn the case of the tea, the room was a closed system; no energy could enter it. But we can also make it an open system by placing a heater into the room. If we turn on the heater, we can use the heat from it to reheat the cup of tea. New energy has been brought into the room. The entropy has thus decreased. The heat that went from the heater into the tea can then move into the room again until total entropy has been reached. This is what the second law of thermodynamics is about.\nA real life example of an open system is the Earth. It gets a lot of energy from the Sun every day. This allows plants to grow and water to stay liquid. If we took away the Sun, plants would die and water would freeze because the surface of our planet would be too cold."}

It is a private land-grant university, receiving annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White co-founded it in 1865 by sponsoring a bill in the New York State Legislature to designate it as New York's land grant college. The university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge\u2013from the classics to the sciences and from the theoretical to the applied. This goal was uncommon in 1865. The goal is stated in Cornell's motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\" Since its founding, Cornell has also been a co-educational, secular institution where admission is offered irrespective of gender, religion or race.\nThe university has seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of two private land grant universities, and its seven undergraduate colleges include three state-supported statutory or contract colleges. As a land grant college, it also operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York.\nCornell counts more than 255,000 living alumni, 31\u00a0Marshall Scholars, 28\u00a0Rhodes Scholars and 41 Nobel laureates as affiliated with the university. It has 13,000 undergraduate and 6,000 graduate students from all 50 states and 122 countries.\nCornell's athletics teams are called the Big Red, and they have 36 varsity teams. They play against other teams in the Ivy League.\nColleges.\nCornell is divided into colleges. Each operates independently and has its own faculty and admission process: The \"statutory\" or \"contract\" colleges (which receive direct funding from the New York state government) have \"New York State\" in their name. Residents of New York who are enrolled in these colleges pay less tuition than other students at the university. Cornell calls its other colleges \"endowed colleges\".\nGraduate.\nThe four statutory colleges are also units of the State University of New York.\nCornell also had two other colleges that closed. The New York State College of Forrestry closed in 1903. The Nursing School closed in 1979.\nResearch.\nCornell, a research university, produces the fourth largest number of graduates in the world who go on to pursue PhDs in engineering or the natural sciences at American institutions. It is also fifth in the world in producing graduates who pursue PhDs at American institutions in any field. Research is a central element of Cornell's mission. In 2009 Cornell spent $671\u00a0million on science and engineering research and development. This makes it the 16th highest in the United States.\nFor the 2004\u201305 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3\u00a0million on research. Of Cornell's units, the largest amount of this funding went to the colleges of Medicine ($164.2\u00a0million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5\u00a0million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3\u00a0million), and Engineering ($64.8\u00a0million). The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0\u00a0million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the university. Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five institutions in forming start-up companies. In 2004\u201305, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1\u00a0million to Cornell units and inventors.\nSince 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to Mars. In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission. Cornell's Steve Squyres, Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honors by \"Science\". Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and Cornell's Space Sciences Building. Further, Cornell researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus. Also, Cornell built and operated the world's largest and most sensitive radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.\nIn 1952, John O. Moore at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory began the Automotive Crash Injury Research project. (In 1972, the lab was separated from the University as Calspan Corporation.) It pioneered the use of crash testing, originally using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries. The project led Liberty Mutual to fund the building of a demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers. Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations. Other ideas, such as rear-facing passenger seats, were less popular.\nIn 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications began the development of NSFNet, a TCP/IP-based computer network that could connect to the ARPANET, at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-kbit/s network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s T1s in 1988 and to 45\u00a0Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the Internet and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the World Wide Web.\nCornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider. After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and building the Tevatron, the largest accelerator in the United States. Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.\nIn the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a National Resource Center (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010\u20132014. Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia. The George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is in the historic \"Treman House.\" The George McTurnan Kahin Center is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and scholars, faculty members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices."}

{"id": "146741", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146741", "title": "Pug", "text": "The pug is a type of dog with a wrinkly face. It also has a curled tail, and pug puppies are called puglets. The pug has a square, muscular body with a large head, big eyes, and small ears. They have often been described as \"multum in parvo\", which means \"much in little\", referring to the pug's character and size. Pugs came originally from Taiwan, but they became popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland.\nDescription.\nPugs are popular and often liked most for their curly tails, compact body, a deep chest, and strong muscles. There are two different types of a Pug's ears, \"rose\" and \"button\". \"Rose\" ears are smaller than the \"button\" ears and are folded up instead of on the side of the head. Most people prefer \"button\" style Pugs. Pugs have strong, straight legs and laid back shoulders. Their feet are not as large as a hare's foot, but they are not as round as that of a cat, either. They have toes that are split up perfectly, and their nails are all black. The lower teeth normally grow farther out than the upper teeth, so they meet in an under-bite.\nCoat and color.\nThe coat of pugs can be a lot of different colors, including fawn, apricot, silver, or black. A very rare pug is white. The fur color may be white due to albinism. There is also a smutty fawn pug, which has a very dark head and dark forelegs. The tail usually curls at the hip.\nDifferent coat types shed differently, but they all shed year-round. The pug who has a fawn color sheds the most. Grooming their fur helps prevent too much shedding.\nNature.\nThe pug is very strong-willed, but does not act aggressively unless provoked to a high degree. Pugs are well kept for families with children. They can be quiet and nice but also funny according to the owner's mood. They are also good at guarding the house.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nPugs came from Taiwan, as most high people of Taiwan kept them as pets at around 400 BCE.\nIn East China, they were known as the \"Lo-Chiang-Sze\" or \"Foo\". In the early 551 BCE, Confucius described the pug as a \"short mouthed dog\". After that, pugs became popular in Tibet, especially for monks. Then, pugs became known toward Japan and then Europe. The pug's origin is unknown because the first Emperor of China destroyed everything related to the pug in his reign.\nChinese Fu-Dogs, also called Lion-Dogs or Fo-Dogs, were thought of as brave dogs who were skilled at guarding, so statues of them were placed outside the temples.\n16th and 17th centuries.\nThe Dutch East India Company imported the pug first in the late 16th and 17th centuries. Later, in 1572, a pug named Pompey saved the Prince of Orange by warning him when the Spaniards came. William III and Mary II also took a pug with them when they were going from Netherlands to England for the seat of the throne in 1688.\nThe pug was also becoming famous in other European countries as well. The Spanish painter, Goya, painted pugs in Spain and Italy sitting beside the coachmen of the rich. They were used as guard dogs and to find animals or people.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nAfter that, pugs began to become popular in France. A pug named Fortune was a messenger between Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais and her family while she was in prison. In Italy, the pug was becoming famous also. A Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal that \"every carriage I meet here has a pug in it\".\nIn 19th century England, Queen Victoria was a very sincere lover of pugs. She had many pet pugs, such as Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima, and Venus.\nThe pug finally arrived in the United States during the 19th century and soon became popular there as well. Many pugs won dog shows, and soon the Pug Dog Club was founded in 1931.\nHealth problems.\nBecause pugs do not have long snouts, they can get eye diseases. They also cannot breathe well, because passages for oxygen are very small and they cannot regulate their temperature with their tongue well. A pug's normal body temperature is between and . If the temperature rises to , they need to cool down immediately because they cannot cool themselves enough. If the temperature reaches , their organs can fail. \nPugs that live by themselves can have the problem of overweight, although this can be helped by exercising and eating healthy food. \nSerious issues.\nPugs can also be hurt by \"necrotizing meningoencephalitis\" (NME). NME is an inflammation of the brain and meninges. It is also known as \"pug dog encephalitis\" (PDE). There is no known cure or explanation for NME, although most people believe it is a disease that dogs may inherit from their mother or father. All dogs usually die within a few months after this disease, which usually happens from 6 months to 7 years of age. \nPugs can also get a serious disease in their spine.\nCommon conditions.\nBecause pugs have wrinkles on their faces, owners must clean the folded part of their skin. Hip dysplasia is another major problem for pugs. About 63.8% of pugs were caught with hip dysplasia. \nWhen pugs get excited, they begin to \"reverse sneeze\", in which they will breathe in short, quick breaths. \"Reverse sneezing\" is usually not harmful to the pug. It can be helped by massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose to make it breathe instead with its mouth. \nMedia and culture.\nPugs have come out in television and film, such as Frank the Pug in the film \"Men in Black\" and the follow-up series. Other films that have pugs include \"12 Rounds\", \"Marie Antoinette (2006 film)\", and Disney's film about \"Pocahontas\". They have also appeared on television, in shows like: \"Poldark,The West Wing\"\nPugs have also appeared in many fictional books, like Lady Bertram's pug in \"Mansfield Park\" and in the book \"Pugs: God's Little Weirdos\".\nFamous people who own pugs include broadcaster Jonathan Ross and actress Jessica Alba."}

A planned economy is where the big decisions are made at the centre by the government. \nIn an economic system the main decisions are, for example, allocating resources like labour, capital and oil. Prices, too, are controlled. In a command economy, these decisions are taken by a central body, usually the government. This system contrasts that of a market economy where all the economic actors involved take decisions. The benefit of a planned economy is that the planning body has (supposedly) perfect information, and can make a better decision than in the market economy. Countries at war sometimes command their people to make things the war needs; the major powers in World War II did this.\nFriedrick von Hayek, a 20th-century economist, thought that it is not possible for the planning body to have perfect information. For this reason, the decisions taken by this body will be wrong, as it is not possible to foresee all possible events. Once the decision has been taken there is only a small margin to vary the production; this means that a planned economy cannot adapt to a change as rapidly as a market economy. According to Ludwig von Mises, there is no competition, and there are no reasons to innovate or to look for different solutions to a problem, in a planned economy.\nPlanned economies have sometimes been successful. After World War I and the Russian Civil War the Soviet Union was very undeveloped, but the command economy was able to resume pre-war industrial growth, to build houses and to bring electric power distribution to millions. In a few decades the country became strong and started space travel.\nCommunism is a type of government system that would use a command economy. The only country that now employs a pure command system is North Korea. All the other communist countries that operated under the command system have converted to a mixed economy that resembles the market system. Formerly, the Eastern Bloc and China were command economies, and are now mixed economies where the government still has a major influence."}

He experimented with new ways of composing which many people did not understand at the time. These became more widely used later in the century. He used dissonant (harsh) sounding intervals and techniques such as polytonality (playing in several keys at once), polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) and polytextures (several textures at once). Very few people listened to his music at the time he was writing it. Only much later did musicians start to realize the importance of his work. Ives earned his living as an insurance agent. He composed in his spare time.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nCharles Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut. His father George Ives was a U.S. Army bandleader in the American Civil War. His mother was a singer. His father taught him a great deal about the music and encouraged him to experiment with new sounds. As well as teaching him counterpoint and introducing him to the music of J.S.Bach he trained his son\u2019s musical ear by getting him to sing a tune in one key while he played the accompaniment in another. In this way the young Charles became used to modern sounds that were quite different from traditional, Romantic music. Charles also listened in Danbury town square to his father's marching band and other bands that were playing on other sides of the square, so that he heard a mixture of several pieces of music at the same time. His father also taught him the music of Stephen Foster. \nIves became a church organist at the age of 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his \"Variations on 'America' \". At the same time he also enjoyed sport and was good at baseball, football and tennis.\nIves spent four years at Yale University. His teacher Horatio Parker was very good and taught him important basic techniques of composing, but he could not understand some of things that Ives was writing in his music. Ives got annoyed when his teacher told him he could not finish a section of music on a dissonant chord, but Ives liked it like that. The choirmaster at the Centre Church where Ives played the organ was John Griggs. He had more understanding of what Ives was trying to do. It was a terrible blow to Charles when his father died on 4 November 1894. He always had a huge admiration for his father who had encouraged him in his musical experiments. Charles kept busy composing. He did not do any sport at Yale because his father had forbidden him to take part in sport so that he would spend his time on studying. By the time Charles graduated he had composed more than 40 songs, several marches, overtures, anthems and organ pieces, a string quartet and a symphony. However, most people thought of him as the composer of a simple waltz tune called \"The Bells of Yale\". \nAdult years.\nAfter his studies at Yale Ives continued to work as a church organist while working for an insurance firm. He was very good at his job and became very well known in the insurance business. Some of his business friends were often surprised to find out that he was also a composer. \nIn 1907, Ives had his first \"heart attack\". These attacks may have been more to do with his imagination. When he was better he composed more than ever before. He married in 1908. After several heart attacks in 1918 he composed very little. He stopped composing altogether in 1926. His health problems continued, and he retired from the insurance business in 1930. He spent some time revising works he had written early, but never wrote any more new pieces.\nIves died in 1954 in New York City at 12:32 PM.\nHis music.\nIves published more than 100 of his songs. He was a very good pianist and the piano parts are often quite difficult. They include bitonality and pantonality.. Although he is now best known for his orchestral music, he composed two string quartets and other chamber music. His organ piece \"Variations on \"America\"\" (1891), takes the tune \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" (which is the same tune as \"God Save the Queen \") and changes it in several amusing variations, using a march, a ragtime and bitonality. it was not published until 1949. The variations differ sharply: a running line, a set of close harmonies, a march, a polonaise, and a ragtime allegro; the interludes are one of the first uses of bitonality.\nHis \"Symphony Number 1\" was fairly traditional, but \"Symphony Number 2\" is much more modern sounding, even ending with a dissonant chord with 11 notes.\nIn 1902 he gave up his organ job. He left all his best anthems and organ music in the church library, and these were thrown out in 1915 when the church moved so most of them are lost.\n\"Central Park in the Dark\" is a piece for orchestra which describes the mysterious, quiet park and then sounds of music coming from nearby nightclubs in Manhattan (playing the popular music of the day, ragtime, quoting \"Hello My Baby\" and even Sousa's \"Washington Post March\"). \nPerhaps the piece which is most often heard today is the short fanfare \"The Unanswered Question\" (1908), written for the very unusual combination of trumpet, four flutes, and string orchestra. The strings, playing from behind the stage, play very slow, chorale-like music throughout the piece while several times the trumpet (playing from behind the audience) plays a short group of notes that Ives described as \"the eternal question of existence\". Each time the trumpet is answered with harsh outbursts from the flutes (onstage) \u2014 apart from the last one. That is the question that is left unanswered. Musicians often have discussions about what the real meaning of the piece is.\nAnother well-known orchestral work is \"Three Places in New England\". His best-known piano work is his \"Concord Sonata\". Ives often liked to quote bits of other pieces, and in this piano sonata he quotes the famous opening of Beethoven's \"Fifth Symphony\". It also has an interesting example of one of Ives' experiments: in the second movement, he tells the pianist to use a 14\u00be\u00a0in (37.5\u00a0cm) piece of wood to make a thick but soft cluster chord. The sonata is one of the best piano works of the 20th century. \nOne of his most interesting works is the his \"Fourth Symphony\" (1910\u201316) written for a huge orchestra. The last movement is like a fight between discord and traditional tonal music. The piece ends quietly with just the percussion playing at a distance. This symphony seems to say everything that Ives had been trying to do in music. It was not until 1965 that a complete performance of the symphony was given. \nIves\u2019 music only gradually began to get well known during the 1930s and into the 1940s. Schoenberg recognized his importance. In 1951, Leonard Bernstein conducted the first performance of Ives' Second Symphony in a broadcast concert by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He recorded a lot of his music and even played some in a television programme for young people."}

Then Louis XIV started the ballet school, called \"Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse\", in 1661. From 1671 until Lully's death in 1687, the school was directed by the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp, the man who set down the five positions of the feet. \nIn 1713 King Louis XIV made the Opera company a state institution. There was a group of professional dancers called \"Le Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra\". From that time until 1875 they used lots of theatres, each one of which was destroyed by a fire.

His name comes from a Latin word meaning \"lucky\". The legend is about a man called Faust. Faust wants to have knowledge. He meets the Devil. The Devil tells Faust he can have anything he wants. In return, the Devil says, Faust must give him his soul. Faust agrees, and the Devil lets Faust have a wonderful time, but in the end Faust has to go to Hell.\nThe story of Faust became famous all over Europe. Many writers from different countries wrote their own versions of the Faust story, e.g. Christopher Marlowe, Goethe, Mikhail Bulgakov, Thomas Mann. Many composers wrote music about Faust, e.g. Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Charles Gounod and Ferrucio Busoni.\nThe adjective \"Faustian\" is used to describe a person who wants something so much that it leads them into trouble.\nIn the early versions of the Faust story: in ballads, dramas and puppet-plays, Faust is always damned (meaning he will have to go to Hell). This is because he prefers human knowledge instead of God\u2019s knowledge. This was thought to be very bad at that time.\nSome of the plays and comic puppet theatre from around the 16th century make up their own versions of the story. They often show Faust as a figure of vulgar fun. The story became popular in England when Christopher Marlowe wrote a play called The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus.

The company merged with Morris in 1952, becoming the lead partner in British Motor Corporation. This became British Leyland and then Rover Group. They began phasing the brand out in 1987; by 1989 all Rover Group cars had been cleared of Austin branding. The name has now passed into the ownership of Nanjing Motor Corporation, who have stated an interest in reviving it.\nHistory.\nIndependent Austin 1905-1952.\nThe company was started in 1905 by Herbert Austin, originally making cars at a factory in Rotherham, Yorkshire before moving to Longbridge, Birmingham. In the First World War Austin made aircraft for the Army and Navy, it was this work which led to the rapid expansion of the company; following the war the company stopped making aircraft. The company became Britain's biggest car maker.\nBritish Motor Corporation 1952-1968.\nIn 1952 Austin merged with its biggest rival Morris (founded by William Morris, afterwards Lord Nuffield), with Austin being the lead partner. This company was known as the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Following the merger with Morris, the model line up for Austin changed considerably. The most notable car to come from this era was the Austin Mini, this was also sold as a Morris Mini and was made up until 2000 (though not as an Austin after 1987). Austin enjoyed a favourable market share during the 1950s and 1960s.\nBritish Leyland 1968-1986.\nIn 1968 BMC merged with Leyland (Leyland, Standard and Triumph) to become British Leyland even though Leyland had been a much smaller firm. It was the British Leyland years that were perhaps the most difficult and in 1975 British Leyland was nationalised. Austin's market share fell, as did other marques within the company, leading to the phasing out of the Morris name plate in 1981. There were many strikes at British Leyland's factories, making British Leyland and other companies with the same problem, such as the Ford Motor Company unproductive compared to Japanese and European companied like Volkswagen. Many of the models in this era failed to sell well, either because they were old fashioned or deemed unreliable; the Austin Princess and the Austin Allegro were the only modern cars of this era, while the 1300, 1800 and Austin Maxi were all dated. The Princess and Allegro sold well, but both were saloons, and the only hatchback the company had was the Maxi, which wasn't a popular car.\nRover 1986-1987.\nBritish Leyland became the Rover Group in 1986. Despite the huge success of the Austin Metro, launched in 1980, there was trouble in the company. In the 1980s Austin sold the most cars in the British Leyland group, however when the company became Rover Group, a greater emphasis was placed on the more upmarket Rover name. In 1987 the company began phasing the name out and by 1989 it had been removed from all products.\nRevival.\nThe name now belongs to Nanjing Motor Corporation who have expressed an interest in reviving it. They currently make cars as MGs (the MG marque came from Morris and consisted of three sports cards MGA, MGB and MGC), however it intends to use this brand name for luxury cars and sports cars. Nanjing does not own the Rover name, so the Austin name is the most recent it has to use for its mainstream mass market cars.\nModels.\nThe company's most famous models were the Austin Seven (1922-39), the Austin A30 (1951-56), the Austin A35 (1956-59), the Austin A55 Cambridge (1954-71), the Austin Mini (1959-2000 but only as an Austin until 1969), the Austin 1800 (1964-75), the Austin 1300 (1967-74), Austin Maxi (1969-81), Austin Allegro (1973-83), Austin Princess/Ambassador (1975-84), Austin Metro (1980-1998 but only as an Austin until 1987), Austin Maestro (1983-94), Austin Montego (1984-94)."}

{"id": "146862", "revid": "7763196", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146862", "title": "Goethe's Faust", "text": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is the most famous play in all German literature. It was published in two parts. Part One is very dramatic, and tells the main story. Part II is extremely long, and it is meant to be read rather than acted on stage. It is about Goethe\u2019s philosophy as well as about history and politics.\nWhat the story is about.\nGoethe\u2019s \"Faust\" is a re-telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany. The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness. The devil (usually called Mephistopheles, as he is in Goethe\u2019s play) tells Faust he can help him to do this, but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell. Faust makes a pact (an agreement) with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for: fine living, gold, women and honour. Faust signs the pact with his blood. Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life. However, in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet.\nHow Goethe worked on the play.\nThe subject of \"Faust\" occupied Goethe all his life. The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769: \u201cDie Mitschuldigen\u201c. In 1773, when he was 24, he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs, the medieval German poet. He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachs\u2019s poetry. This rhythm is known as \u201cKnittelvers\u201d. It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern, e.g.\nIn 1887, long after Goethe\u2019s death, it was discovered that he had made a version of \u201cFaust\u201c which he never published but later decided to rewrite. This version is known as the \u201cUrfaust\u201d (\u201cUr\u201d means \u201coriginal\u201d, i.e. the \u201cOriginal Faust\u201d). It was written between 1772 and 1775. He changed a lot of it and it became \u201cFaust Part I\u201c. A fragment (small part of it) was published in 1790. Then he finished it in 1806, published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829. Part 2 was finished in 1831, a few months before he died, and was not published until a few months after his death.\nPart One.\n\"Faust Part One\" starts off in heaven. Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things.\nWe then see Faust in his study. Faust is trying to get to know all possible things. He wants to know about science, humans and religion. He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know, but he thinks he is not managing to do it. For a moment he thinks of killing himself, but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner, his assistant. A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house.\nIn Faust\u2019s study, the poodle changes into the devil (Mephistopheles). Faust makes an arrangement with the devil: the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth, In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell. Faust's arrangement is that, while Mephistopheles is serving Faust, if Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him, that he wants to stay in that moment forever, he will die that very moment (in German he says: \u201cVerweile doch, du bist so sch\u00f6n\u201d \u2013 \u201cStay a while, you are so beautiful\u201d. It is perhaps the most famous quotation in all German literature.)\nMephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood. Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He loves her, and by offering her jewellery, and with help of a neighbour, Martha, Gretchen lets herself into Faust's arms. Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together, so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust. Faust and Gretchen sleep together. Gretchen\u2019s mother dies of the potion. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen\u2019s brother says Faust is bad and challenges him, but Faust kills him (with the devil\u2019s help, of course). Gretchen has given birth to a baby, but she drowns it. She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison. Faust tries to save her from death, but he cannot free her from prison. Finding that they cannot free her, Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell, while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved.\nPart Two.\n\"Faust Part Two\" is very different from Part One. It keeps referring to classical literature. The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies. He has many adventures. The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things. In the end Faust goes to heaven, because he loses only half the bet. Angels, who arrive as messengers of God\u2019s mercy, say at the end of Act 5: \"He who strives on and lives to strive/ Can earn redemption still\" (i.e. anyone who tries hard in life can still be saved).\nPeople\u2019s views about Goethe\u2019s \"Faust\".\nGoethe\u2019s \"Faust\" had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries. In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend. They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people. Dramas, epic poems and novels were written about Faust. Composers wrote operas or orchestral music about him. Thomas Mann wrote a novel \"Dr Faustus\" which compares Faust\u2019s pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler."}

Both started to climb the wall at around 14:15. Kubelik was successful, and could escape. Fechter was hit by several gunshots, one of which pierced his lung, and fell back down, to what was called the \"Death strip\". He was unable to move, and started to cry for help. Crowds started to gather on both sides of the wall; on the east side, they were dispersed by police.\nPolice gathered on the west side threw medical kits to him; despite the crowd asking them, they would not do more. The DDR border guards did not do anything either; neither did the United States personnel on duty at the Checkpoint.\nFechter bled to death after about an hour. After reunification, two border police were found guilty of manslaughter. They were convicted and given suspended prison terms of 20 and 21 months respectively. Both had told the court they fired shots at Fechter, but did not want to kill him. The court also ruled that Fechter was killed by the shots, and not by the absence of aid. The evidence could not show who of three gunman (one had already died) was responsible for the bullet that killed Fechter."}

The system is owned by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), which used to be called the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE). It is operated under contract by the RATP Group.\nHistory.\nThe construction of Manchester's railway network in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had created a lot of termini around the City Centre. These were not linked together. This left a large amount of Manchester disconnected from the railway network.\nFor many years there had been plans to connect Manchester's two main railway stations. These are Piccadilly and Victoria. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were plans for a \"Picc-Vic tunnel\". This tunnel would carry main-line trains under the city centre. The proposal was abandoned because it would cost too much.\nMetrolink was created by converting two British Rail lines serving the suburbs of Manchester, one to the town of Altrincham to the south, and another to the town of Bury to the north, to light rail. These two lines were joined up in Manchester city centre, where trams run on the roads, and had a short branch to Piccadilly railway station. This first section of the new system opened in 1992, and a newer line to Eccles opened in 2001.\nLots of extensions to the system have opened since then, with more that are currently being built or proposed. Metrolink now has lines that serve Didsbury, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham, Rochdale, MediaCityUK and Manchester Airport. These expansions increased the system's length from 37\u00a0km to 97\u00a0km with 99\u00a0stops. Sometime in 2017 there will be a second line through Manchester city centre serving Exchange Square, and another line towards the Trafford Centre shopping mall before the end of the decade. There are also plans for tram-train lines to Stockport and other places in Greater Manchester."}

The Queanbeyan River flows through Queanbeyan, near the centre of the city.\nHistory.\nThe town grew from a farm owned by ex-convict inn keeper, Timothy Beard. It was on the banks of the Molonglo River. The original name was \"Quinbean\" which means \"clear waters\".\nQueanbeyan became a township in 1838. There were about 50 people living there. Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days. Traces of gold were found in 1851. There were also some lead and silver mines. Settlers were often robbed by bushrangers including John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall. In 1836, the government built a Post Office at Queanbeyan. \nThe first bank was opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September, 1859. This was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited which is now part of the National Australia Bank. \"The Golden Age\" now called \"The Queanbeyan Age\" was Queanbeyan's first newspaper started in 1860 by John Gale. In 1880 John James Wright, the first mayor of Queanbeyan, built a house on the banks of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 house became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.\nThe railway reached Queanbeyan railway station in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to Canberra and Bombala. There are now two trains a day, the Countrylink Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.\nQueanbeyan became an important country town, with 16 hotels and six flour mills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. Canberra was started as the national capital in 1911. There were no hotels, so people crossed the border to get a drink at Queanbeyan's hotels. When the Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1926, Canberra got it's first hotel.\nQueanbeyan became a city on 7 July, 1972. From 1982 to 1989, the Canberra Raiders rugby league team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at Seiffert Oval."}

It is also known as the death of God. The phrase is not meant literally. Instead it is about what value destruction has done to people's belief in Christianity. Some religious thinkers do take it literally though.\nNietzsche wrote this phrase in his book \"The Gay Science\" (). It is in the section called \"The Madman\". He also used the phrase in his book \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular.\nThe idea is written in \"The Madman\" as follows:\nMeaning.\n\"God is dead\" does not mean that Nietzsche believed in an actual \"God\" who had died literally. Nietzsche is also not saying that atheists are right. Instead, the phrase means that everything built on Christianity will fall apart because \"the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable\". This becomes a deep sadness because it includes all European morality as well. For Nietzsche, the destruction of Christian morality is something to celebrate. It is also something to confidently replace with a non-Christian morality. \"God is dead\" is an attack on anyone who thinks that a non-Christian morality can support the morals that people take for granted. Many philosophers still think this way and Nietzsche says they are wrong. He says it is impossible to have a Christian or pseudo-Christian morality without the belief in God. This was a problem he had with many modern sceptics.\nThe \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" says that even though the basis of Christianity was meant to have been unbreakable, it is already broken. In fact, it has been much more than anyone could ever understand. This also means that without God, morals are not unquestionable or undoubtable anymore. Nietzsche says that when these morals are shown to be false they are also shown to be harmful. Also, trying to remove these harmful morals causes even more harm. This is because people have become dependent on them. He also says that the most harmful parts of morality have taken control of how we understand ourselves. Therefore, we don't know how to live without this harmful morality. Because of this, the death of God leads to many kinds of nihilism. Nietzsche says that Christianity itself is a kind of nihilism."}

His great-uncle was the painter Eustache Le Sueur. He started his musical training by singing in the choir at the church of Abbeville, then at the cathedral of Amiens. Le Sueur became chorus master at the cathedral of S\u00e9es. He went to Paris to study harmony. His teacher was Abb\u00e9 Nicolas Roze, chorus master at the church Saints-Innocents. Le Sueur got jobs at Dijon (1779), Le Mans (1782), Tours (1783) and then took over Roze\u2019s job at the Saints-Innocents at Paris. In 1786 he was made music director at the famous church Notre-Dame de Paris.\nAt Notre Dame he started to use orchestras to play the music for some of the special services. The priests did not like this. Le Sueur replied by writing a little book about music for big religious celebrations. It was a bad time in France financially and the church had to make savings, so Le Sueur could not have his orchestra any more, so he resigned from his job.\nLe Sueur spent some time in London, 1788\u201392, then returned to Paris where the revolution was going on. Three of his operas were performed, and he became professor at the \u00c9cole de la Garde Nationale, and then at the Conservatoire which was very new at the time. There he taught basic music theory. He was unable to get any more operas of his performed. He wrote a book saying how music should be taught in France, and criticizing the Conservatoire and its director. Because of that he lost his job at the Conservatoire.\nLe Sueur now had no job and so he was very poor. Then, in 1804, Napoleon made him ma\u00eetre de la chapelle at the Tuileries in the place of Giovanni Paisiello. He was then able to have his most famous work performed at the Op\u00e9ra. It was called \"Ossian ou Les bardes\". Napoleon liked it very much and gave Le Sueur the cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Le Sueur composed the \"Triumphal March\" for the coronation of Napoleon. In 1813, he was given a position at the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, replacing Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try.\nAt the Bourbon Restoration, he was named composer of the royal chapel and conductor of the orchestra of the Op\u00e9ra. From the beginning of 1818, he taught composition at the Conservatoire. He stayed there many years. His most famous pupils were Hector Berlioz, Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod.\nHe died in Paris."}

Alternative names for the Tajiks are (Eastern) Persian, Dehqan, and Farsiwan. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, some Tajik refugees escaped to live in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. Most Tajiks are Sunni Muslims, but a few in remote mountain areas follow Shia Islam alongside pockets in cities such as Herat and Kabul.\nThe name \"Tajik\" being used for this group of people began in the early 20th century by the Russians. Before that, they were called \"Sarts\". The name \"Tajik\" refers to the traditionally sedentary people who speak a form of Persian language called \"Tajiki\" in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and officially called \"Dari\" in Afghanistan.\nIt is generally accepted that the origin of the word \"Tajik\" is Middle Persian \"T\u0101z\u012bk\" \"Arab\" (New Persian: \"Tazi\"), or an Iranian (Sogdian or Parthian) cognate word. Some Turks of Central Asia adopted a variant of this word, \"T\u00e4\u017eik\", to designate the Persian Muslims in the Oxus basin and Khorasan, who were the Turks' rivals. \nHistorians believe that the Tajiks may be connected to ancient Aryans who lived in the region for thousands of years. They were the heirs and transmitters of the Central Asian sedentary culture that diffused in prehistoric times from the Iranian plateau into an area extending roughly from the Caspian Sea to the borders of China. The Aryans constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwarezm, Sogdiana and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania. They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great, and they mixed with later invaders like the Mauryans, Kushans and Hepthalites. Over the course of time, the language that was used by these ancient people eventually gave way to Farsi, a western dialect now officially spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. In the 13th century, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army settled in many of the popular Persian cities after wiping out the Persian population. These Mongols later adopted the Persian language and the religion of Islam, the Persian-speaking Hazaras claiming partial descent from them. Tajiks usually reject a Mongol or Turkic origin and claim to be descended from the ancient Iranians of Central Asia. However, historically, there has been heavy intermixing between the sedentary Turkic-speaking Central Asians and the Persian-speaking Central Asians"}

As adventures, \"Ivanhoe\", and \"Rob Roy\" are very well-known, and both were made into films. \"Waverley\" is important because it is the first historical novel. It was, for most readers, their first encounter with Highland culture. Scott wove together history and fiction. What he started with \"Waverley\", he continued with his other novels.\nScott's output was huge. Though many of his works are little read now, they sold well in their day, and paid for his great house, Abbotsford. Of his poetry \"The Lady of the Lake\" is best liked. \nScott was also an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession. Throughout his career he combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire.\nA prominent member of the Tory establishment in Edinburgh, Scott was an active member of the Highland Society and served a long term as President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820\u201332).\nEducation and early life.\nScott was educated at Edinburgh High and the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1783. After spending some time in his father's office he became a barrister in 1792. In 1797 he married Charlotte Charpentier and in 1799 was appointed deputy Sheriff of Selkirkshire.

His house is now a public museum visited by many tourists each year.\nFinancial problems and death.\nIn 1825 and 1826, a banking crisis swept through the cities of London and Edinburgh. The Ballantyne printing business, in which he was heavily invested, crashed. Scott was ruined. He placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors, and set out to write his way out of debt. \nHe kept up his huge output of fiction, as well as producing a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte. By 1831 his health was failing. Still, he did a grand tour of Europe, where he was welcomed wherever he went. He returned to Scotland and, in September 1832, died at Abbotsford, near Melrose in the Roxburghshire. Though he died owing money, his novels continued to sell well. The debts of his estate were eventually discharged."}

{"id": "147037", "revid": "7893279", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147037", "title": "Pawn (chess)", "text": "The pawn (\u2659\u265f) is the weakest piece in the game of chess. They represent infantry. Each player starts the game with eight pawns, one on each square of the second row (or rank) from the view of the player. In the white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, ..., h2, while the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, ..., h7.\nMoving.\nPawns move differently than other pieces. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Most of the time, a pawn moves by going up a single square, but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place, it can go forward two squares. Pawns cannot use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture. Any piece in front of a pawn, white or black, stops its moving. If a pawn touches the other side it is exchanged for one of the players pieces that got captured. \nCapturing.\nThe white pawn at e4 can capture either the black rook at d5 or the black knight at f5, but not the bishop at e5, which blocks its straight way forward. Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same way as it moves. A pawn captures diagonally, one square forward and to the left or right. In the diagram to the left, the white pawn can capture either the black rook or the black knight.\nEn passant.\nAn even more unusual move is the \"en passant\" capture.\nEn passant happens when a pawn uses its first-move option to move two squares forward instead of one. If it passes over a square guarded by an enemy pawn, that pawn can take the first pawn \"in passing\" \"as if\" the first pawn had moved forward only one square. The taking pawn moves into the empty square over which the first pawn moved. The first pawn is removed from the board. To capture \"en passant\" can only be done on the move right after the double-square pawn advance. Otherwise the chance is lost.\nThe \"en passant\" move was added in late fifteenth-century Europe, to make up for the then newly added two-square first move rule. We have no record of why the rule was added, but it is easy to see that it works to prevent the position becoming blocked and uninteresting.\nPromotion.\nOnce a pawn reaches the other side of the board and cannot move further, it is promoted, meaning it can become any other piece on the board, except the king. Players usually promote their pawns to a queen because it is the next most-powerful piece on the board.\nHistory.\nAs the simplest piece in chess, the pawn was in the oldest version of chess, Chaturanga. It is present in all other types of chess around the world.\nThe changes which took place in the fifteenth century were aimed at allowing the pieces to develop faster, and make the game more exciting."}

The moves of the pieces are defined by tradition, and by the international chess federation, FIDE. \nThe bottom-right square of the board for each player must be white.\nSummary.\nPawn - A pawn can only move ahead, to the far end of the board. A pawn is placed in each square on the second row away from each player at the beginning of a game, right in front of all of their other pieces, so each player begins with eight pawns. Most times, a pawn can only move to one square, the square in front of it. But a pawn that has not moved yet in the game can move ahead two squares, or just one. \nIf an enemy piece is straight in front of a pawn, the pawn cannot capture that piece. Pawns have a special way to capture. A pawn can capture an enemy piece which is on the diagonal square to the left or right of the square in front of it. This is the only time a pawn can move to a square that is not straight in front of it.\nIf a pawn reaches the end of the board, it is removed and replaced by any other piece the player chooses, except a king or pawn.\nIf a pawn moves two squares on its first move, it may be taken (on the opponent's next move only) by an enemy pawn as if it had moved only one. This is called \"en passant\" (French for \"in passing\"). A pawn is worth 1 point.\nBishop - A bishop can move any number of squares \"diagonally\", meaning, if you pretend the bishop is in the middle of a big X, it can move to any square along the lines of the X. Because of this, a bishop will be on the same color of squares for the whole game. At the start, a bishop is placed on the third from the left and third from the right of the row of pieces closest to each player. A bishop is worth 3 points. \nKnight - The knight is special because it is the only piece than can jump over other pieces. When a knight moves, first it goes two squares in one of the four ways a rook can move. Then the knight ends its move by going one square to the side. The knight is said to move in the shape of an L. See the picture \"(picture is coming)\". It \"jumps over\" the pieces on its way to its new square, and does not capture them, but the knight will capture an enemy piece if it lands on one. Knights are placed at the second and seventh squares on the rows closest to each player, between the rooks and the bishops. A knight is worth 3 points.\nRook - A rook can move any number of squares: left or right on the ranks, and up &amp; down on the files. Rooks start at the far left and far right squares in the row closest to each player, next to the knights. A rook is worth 5 points.\nQueen - The queen combines the moves of a bishop and a rook. The queen is placed next to the king \"on a square of its own colour\". Thus the two queens exactly face each other at the start. The queen is worth 9 points.\nKing - The king starts next to the queen. The king can move to one of the eight squares around it. It is limited as an active piece, but always is vulnerable to attack. No numerical value can be put on it.\nA king may perform a special move known as \"castling\". This is when a king moves two spaces towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square on the other side of the king. This may not be done if: "}

She made her first appearance in Series 3's \"Smith and Jones\", broadcast in the UK on 31 March 2007.\nAppearances.\nTelevision.\nMartha Jones is introduced in the 2007 series of \"Doctor Who\", first appearing in the episode \"Smith and Jones\". When the hospital she works at is moved to the Moon, Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as the Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, the Doctor invites her to join him for one trip in his time machine the TARDIS, but he later accepts her as his full-time \"companion\", admitting that she was \"never just a passenger\", and he even gives her the key to the TARDIS. Nevertheless, she becomes frustrated because the Doctor does not realise her feelings for him, When the Doctor falls in love(while believing himself to be a human) in the \"Human Nature\"/\"The Family of Blood\" two-parter, a pained Martha claims \"You had to go and fall in love with a human... and it wasn't me\". In the last episode of the series she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which saves the Doctor and reverses time, undoing the Master's actions.\nThe character reappears in the 2008 series of the \"Doctor Who\" spin-off \"Torchwood\", which focuses on occasional \"Doctor Who\" companion Jack Harkness. She first appeared in the episode \"Reset\" as part of a three-episode story, \nLater in the Fourth Series of Doctor Who, Martha returns for a three-episode arc beginning with \"The Sontaran Stratagem\" and ending with \"The Doctor's Daughter\", Agyeman appears in the role again for the final two episodes of the series, \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\",where she has been promoted to a US division of UNIT.\nOther Appearances.\nAside from television appearances, the character of Martha also appears in \"Doctor Who\" novels and comic books, some of which it is unknown if they are canon or not.\nIn books, Martha appears in the \"New Series Adventures\" series of \"Doctor Who\" novels, published by BBC Books. The first book published was a \"Quick Reads\" novel, \"Made of Steel\" by Terrance Dicks (published before her first television appearance), and the character subsequently appeared in all novels in the series, starting with \"Sting of the Zygons\" by Stephen Cole and most recently in \"The Many Hands\" by Dale Smith. Freema Aygeman appears as the character on the cover of every novel. In late 2008 \"The Story of Martha\", a collection of stories focusing on Martha's adventures between \"The Sound of Drums\" and \"Last of the Time Lords\", will be published.\nIn comic strip apperences,Martha has appeared in the \"Doctor Who Magazine\" strips from #381 onwards and the \"Doctor Who Adventures\" comics from #28 onwards. The character also appears in the \"Battles in Time\" series of comic books periodically. In 2007, American comic book publisher IDW Publishing announced their plans to do a series of Tenth Doctor and Martha comics for a America. When asked about canonicity, IDW executive editor Chris Ryall dodged the issue by saying all the comics are \"blessed\" by Russell T Davies but it is up to the individual how canonical each story is.\nMartha also appears in a Radio 4 \"Torchwood\" drama, \"Lost Souls\" which aired in Summer 2008."}

At his baptism he had 36 godfathers and was given 36 Christian names. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire. He was a good musician, but mostly he enjoyed popular dance music. He conducted a band, but had to leave Paris because he owed people a lot of money.\nCareer in England.\nHe went to London where he formed a good orchestra. His orchestra played at a series of summer concerts (called \"Concerts d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9\"). Later he conducted a series of winter concerts (\"Concerts d\u2019hiver\"). Although he was a good conductor he was a great showman. He would make a big show of putting on his white gloves which were given to him on a silver plate. He used a special baton (conductor\u2019s stick) which had jewels in it when he conducted Beethoven. He wore a white waistcoat and enormous wrist bands, and he had a huge moustache and long, black hair. He would throw himself around when conducting and finish by sinking into a velvet chair. The audience loved it, especially when he added military bands to his orchestra. He used to conduct facing the audience. He conducted concerts in the London theatres and parks (promenade concerts).\nJullien\u2019s programmes included works by the great composers, e.g. Beethoven and Mozart, but they were always mixed with light music: dances, quadrilles, marches, etc. He often added lots of extra instruments to the great classics, e.g. when he conducted Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony he added four ophicleides, a saxophone and side drums.\nJullien travelled to Scotland, Ireland and America with his orchestra. In 1852 he produced an opera, \"Pietro il grande\", at Covent Garden, but it cost a ridiculous amount of money and he was financially ruined.\nHis final years.\nEventually he went back to France where he was arrested and put in prison because of his debts. He died in a lunatic asylum. His wife, to whom he had been happily married, lived on for many years, and their son Louis became a conductor and tried to conduct promenade concerts, but he did not have much success.\nHis reputation.\nJullien\u2019s behaviour might seem strange to us today, but he lived at a time when the role of the conductor was becoming very important as orchestras had become much larger than they had been in the 18th century. He gave people who had never heard good classical music the chance to hear the music by the great composers. He had a very big influence on the musical scene in London and people talked about him for many years after his death."}

Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. However, in this season no Tropical Cyclone formed after November 30, the end of the season because the last storm, Hurricane Gordon died on November 21, just nine days before the 30th.\nThe season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes, which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The strongest, Hurricane Florence, it's top winds were at a Category 2 storm with winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h). Aside from Chris, Florence, and Gordon, none of the storms became hurricanes. A famous hurricane from 1994 would probably be Hurricane Gordon. Hurricane Gordon was a strange long lived November hurricane that killed at least 1,100 people in Haiti.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Alberto.\nAlberto formed from a north-moving tropical depression north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on July 2. Tropical Storm Alberto continued north, making landfall near Destin, Florida on July 3 as a moderately strong tropical storm. The storm weakened quickly to a tropical depression, which then moved around Georgia and Alabama until it dissipated on July 7. Damage was guessed at $500\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD) and 30 deaths were caused by the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.\nTropical Depression Two.\nTropical Depression Two formed near South Carolina on the 19th. The depression moved north making landfall in South Carolina and dissipated on July 23rd. No damage or deaths reported.\nTropical Storm Beryl.\nBeryl formed off the Florida Panhandle on August 15, only twelve hours before it made landfall near Panama City, Florida. Beryl quickly strengthened before landfall and reached its top winds of 60\u00a0mph. Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia, across the Carolinas, and all the way to Connecticut where it was absorbed by a frontal system. Damage was guessed at $73\u00a0million (1994 USD). Though it caused no deaths, a lot of people were injured by the 37 tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.\nHurricane Chris.\nChris formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 17, and reached hurricane strength the next day. It moved to the northwest and turned north and brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm on the 21st. Chris continued north, and dissipated without causing any damage\nTropical Depression Five.\nThe wave that would become Tropical Depression Five was tracked beginning on August 17. The wave was upgraded into a depression on August 29 near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Tropical Depression Five made landfall in Tampico on the 31st and dissipating the same day over Mexico. No damage was caused by Tropica Depression Five.\nTropical Storm Debby.\nTropical Storm Debby formed on September 10, just east of the lesser antilies. The storm crossed some of the islands, and dissipated south of Puerto Rico on the 11th. Nine people dead because of Tropical Storm Debby. Damage estimates are not available. It cause flooding and mudslides in Saint Lucia.\nTropical Storm Ernesto.\nErnesto formed southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 it became Tropical Storm Ernesto. It moved north for two days, and by the 24th had weakened to a tropical depression. Two days later Ernesto dissipated without affecting any land.\nTropical Depression Eight.\nTropical Depression Eight formed on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near Honduras. Tropical Depression Eight made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala. Some reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten.\nTropical Depression Nine.\nTropical Depression Nine form off the coast of Africa on September 26. It was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season, 150 miles southeast from the Cape Verde Islands the next day. The depression moved north and dissipated on September 29.\nTropical Depression Ten.\nAn area of disturbed weather, related to Tropical Depression Eight, moved across the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. A tropical wave moved into the area, causing an increase in showers and cloudiness. The wave became Tropical Depression Ten on September 29 about 150 miles off the coast of Cuba. The system became better-organized and when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico, it was absorbed by a non-tropical system on 30th. Tropical Depression Ten caused $5\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD).\nHurricane Florence.\nFlorence, at first formed as a subtropical depression in the central Atlantic on November 2. As it northwest, it took on tropical characteristics and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence on the 4th. It reached hurricane strength, then turned to the northeast and on November 6, as it was picked up by a strong trough. Two days later Florence was absorbed by the same trough that made it turn northeast. There was no reported damage.\nHurricane Gordon.\nHurricane Gordon was a very deadly and damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates range between 500 and 2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Damage was guessed to be at $400\u00a0million (1994 US dollars).\nNor'easter.\nAround Christmas in 1994 a nor'easter may have had tropical characteristics, though it was not called a tropical system. It affected the Mid-Atlantic and New England causing damage at $21 million.\nUnused.\nIn 1994, only 7 out of 21 names were used. The following names were supposed to be used:\nRetirement.\nNo names retired as a result all name would be used again in 2000"}

Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. No storms formed after November 30 in the 1995 season.\nThe 1995 season was extremely active, largely due to favorable conditions including a La Ni\u00f1a and warm sea surface temperatures. Nineteen named storms formed during the season, making it the third most active on record behind the 2005 and 1933 seasons and tied with 1887 season. There were also eleven storms that reached hurricane strength, again the third most hurricanes in one season after the 1969 and 2005 seasons.\nThis season broke the record for the most Tropical Cyclones at a time in the Atlantic with five storm at a time from August 22 to September 1 \u2013 Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Karen, and Luis, were the names of the storms at the same time. \nStorms.\nTropical Depression Six.\nOn August 4, Tropical Depression Six formed in the Bay of Campeche. Six made landfall in over Mexico and dissipated on August 6, never reaching tropical storm strength. There were no reports of damage or deaths. \nTropical Storm Gabrielle.\nTropical Storm Gabrielle formed on August 9 and nearly became a hurricane but it made landfall in Mexico, near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, on August 11. Tropical Storm Gabrielle dissipated the next day without ever reaching hurricane status causing no damage or deaths.\nTropical Storm Jerry.\nTropical Storm Jerry formed just off the Florida coast near Andros Island on August 23 as Tropical Depression Eleven. Jerry made landfall at as a very weak tropical storm. Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida. Jerry dissipated on the 28th over Georgia. \nHurricane Luis.\nHurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Luis was one of the four tropical cyclones active from August 22 to September 1 along with Humberto, Iris, Jerry, and Karen.\nTropical Depression Fourteen.\nTropical Depression Fourteen started on September 9. Fourteen moved mostly to the northwest, which made it further from land. It never became a tropical storm before it died on September 13.\nHurricane Opal.\nOpal started on September 27, just to the east of the Yucatan Peninsula. It soon made landfall before becoming a tropical storm. As soon as it enter the Gulf of Mexico it became a tropical storm. It soon became a hurricane and strengthened fast. Hurricane Opal was stopped at a category 4 hurricane. When it made landfall in Florida on October 3, it was a category 2 hurricane. \nTropical Storm Sebastien.\nTropical Storm Sebastien formed on August 20 from a tropical wave just east of the Lesser Antilles. Sebastien remained rather weak, moving northwest through light wind shear. Sebastien took a sharp turn and started moving south-southwest. On October 24, Sebastien weakened to a depression and made landfall in Anguilla. By this time, Sebastien had entered a low level flow as well as increasing wind shear. On October 25 Sebastien dissipated over the northern Caribbean Sea. Although its remnants still caused heavy rain over Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.\nHurricane Tanya.\nThe 1995 season ended with Hurricane Tanya, the first storm to be get a name beginning with 'T' since hurricane naming began in the Atlantic basin in 1950 it was the only until Tropical Storm Tammy in 2005. \nStorm names.\nThis list is the names set aside for use in for Atlantic tropical cyclones in 1995.

Red giants get their name because they appear to be colored red and they are very large. Many red giants could fit thousands and thousands of suns like ours inside of them. Aldebaran, Arcturus, Betelgeuse and Mira are red giants. \nRight now, our Sun is a main-sequence star, not a red giant. However, five billion years from now, scientists believe our sun will become a red giant. It will be about 200 times bigger in diameter than it is now. It will become so big it will swallow up Mercury, Venus and possibly the Earth.\nHow a star becomes a red giant.\nAll new stars change hydrogen to helium through nuclear fusion. This makes a lot of energy (e.g. light and heat). In a normal star, like our Sun and all other main-sequence stars, this change happens at the very center of the star. Sooner or later, almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium. This causes the nuclear reaction to stop. The center will start to get smaller due to the star's gravity. This makes the layer just outside the center get hotter. This layer still has hydrogen. This hydrogen will fuse to make helium.\nWith this new source of power, the outer layers of the star will get much, much bigger. The star will get brighter, sometimes as much as ten thousand times as bright as when it was on the main sequence. Since the outside of the star is bigger, the energy will be spread over a much larger area. Because of this, the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange.\nThe red giant phase is temporary. It is shorter than the billions of years a star spends on the main sequence. Soon (in only hundreds of millions of years) red giants will start to fuse helium to make other elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Some of their outer layers will blow away, leaving interstellar gas and dust circling the star. In time, most red giants will become white dwarfs. Very large red giants become neutron stars or black holes."}

The exact definition is not yet settled.\nHypergiants are the largest stars in the universe, usually larger than supergiants. The hypergiant with the largest known diameter is Stephenson 2-18, which is about 2,150 times wider than the Sun. \nAnother large hypergiant is NML Cygni, about 1,650 times wider than the Sun. It is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars. A pulsating red hypergiant named UY Scuti is probably larger, with a radius of about 1,700 times the sun.\nHypergiants are very hard to find and they have a short lifespan because of their size. While the Sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion years, hypergiants will only exist for a few million years.\nSpectrum.\nThere are two special groups: luminous blue variables (LBV), and yellow hypergiants. Both of these types are very rare, with only a few examples in the Milky Way galaxy. Their rareness is probably because each type passes through this stage quite rapidly.\nStability.\nAs luminosity of stars increases greatly with mass, the luminosity of hypergiants often lies very close to the Eddington limit. This is the luminosity at which the force of the star's gravity equals the radiation pressure outward. \nThis means that the radiative flux passing through the photosphere of a hypergiant may be nearly strong enough to lift away the photosphere. Above the Eddington limit, the star would generate so much radiation that parts of its outer layers would be thrown off in massive outbursts. This would effectively restrict the star from shining at higher luminosities for longer periods.\nA good candidate for hosting a continuum-driven wind is Eta Carinae, one of the most massive stars ever observed. Its mass is about 130 solar masses and its luminosity four million times that of the Sun. Eta Carinae may occasionally exceed the Eddington limit. The last time might have been outbursts observed in 1840\u20131860. These reached mass loss rates much higher than stellar winds would normally allow.\nAnother theory to explain the massive outbursts of Eta Carinae is the idea of a deeply situated hydrodynamic explosion, blasting off parts of the star\u2019s outer layers. The idea is that the star, even at luminosities below the Eddington limit, would have insufficient heat convection in the inner layers, resulting in a density inversion potentially leading to a massive explosion. The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen."}

It is where Coldplay began working on their first album, \"Parachutes\". One night after finishing recording \"Shiver\", the lead single of the album, the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars. The band looked at the stars and felt generally inspired. The song's main melody popped into the head of Chris Martin, the band's vocalist. The melody was a chord pattern. At first, Martin did not take it seriously \"as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\" The melody \"started off a lot slower\" according to Will Champion, the band's drummer, and sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When Jonny Buckland, the band's guitarist, started playing it and added to it with his own ideas, they had created the riff, \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, however, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word to fit the song's main idea and theme. He thought that this missing word was a key word in the lyrics. He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory \"Yellow Pages\". Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to the directory. But according to him, \"In an alternate universe, this song could be called 'Playboy.'\" The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. The band's bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\nRecording and production.\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was introduced to the band's music through the band's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay. Nelson wanted to work them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was first recorded upstairs in the project studio. This was a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios.\nNelson and the band had some problems when they were making some parts of the song. Champion said that \"...\u00a0it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\" The band tried to get the tempo correct, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The band recorded backing vocals in the control room of Quadrangle.\nNelson used an analogue tape to record most of the tracks in the album. As recording progressed, \"Yellow\" was one of a couple of songs that they \"couldn't quite get on analogue\". They recorded different versions, but they did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools \"to get the feel of [the track] just right\". Once all of the takes were recorded into the computer, \"we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it\", according to Nelson.\nComposition.\nThe song opens with an acoustic guitar part. This is backed by an electric guitar copying the acoustic guitar. It then forwards to the lead guitar line. It then goes back to the acoustic section. Its instrumentation is varied, including the drums, cymbals, and the occasional hi-hat and ascending bass guitar. \"Yellow\" features Martin's falsetto, and nearly spoken-word whispers. Martin, after the song's mixing, felt that his voice was \"too subdued, too quiet\".\nMartin has explained that \"'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and devotion.\" The references in some of the song's lyrics, including the swimming and drawing a line, \"are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion\". The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion. He refers to his unreturned love (Martin was single at the time he wrote the song). Most people have considered \"Yellow\" as a happy song, even though the lyrics do not seem to be.\nRelease and reception.\n\"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were first released as EPs in the spring of 2000. \"Yellow\" was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000. The single includes the songs \"Help Is Round the Corner\" and \"No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground\". The third song was taken from the band's first EP, \"Safety\". In the United States, however, the song was released as the lead single off the album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets. The band released a limited-edition CD of \"Trouble\", the third single off \"Parachutes\", which features a remix of \"Yellow\". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.\nThe single received a massive radio airplay, particularly on BBC Radio 1. This was helped by its TV reception through its music video. The reaction was mostly positive. Even BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly. This heavy rotation continued for months after its release. \"Yellow\" eventually became 2000's most played song on the radio. The song is also regularly played at various British clubs, bars and sporting events. People often sing along when it is played. The song is often played during home games at English Championship club Watford. \"Yellow\" was used as the theme song for ABC fall television ads a month after the album was released in the United States. The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia's \"Daffodil Day\". This was in recognition of that organisation's official flower's yellow hue.\nCritics were positive towards the song. Matt Diehl of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine has noted \"Yellow\" is \"unrepentantly romantic\". He added that \"the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme\". \"Yellow\" won Best Single at the 2001 \"NME\" Carling Awards. It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \"Billboard\" said that \"every time that electric-guitar riff barges in, you're hooked all over again.\"\nImpact and legacy.\nBrian Hiatt of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine has said that the song was a career-making record. Roach has claimed in his book, \"Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easy\", that although \"Shiver\" earned the band their first UK Top 40 single, it was \"Yellow\" that has changed \"everything\", and that it \"exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular\". In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001. According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", for \"Spin\" magazine, the band is still known in the United States for their \"surprise smash 'Yellow'\". A \"Billboard\" magazine review said, \"After one single ('Yellow') and its accompanying album (\"Parachutes\" \u00a0... ), Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne.\" The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album.\nFollowing the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, \"Yellow\" was the first video played on MTV once normal programming resumed."}

Many hybrids exist, both natural and created by humans. These plants come from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar and the Seychelles ; southward to Australia and New Caledonia ; and northward to India and Sri Lanka . Many are plants from hot humid lowland areas, but the majority are from high in the mountains where nights are cold. Nepenthes are often categorized as being lowland or highland varieties, depending on how high they live above sea level. Lowland varieties usually require high temperature and humidity levels. Highland varieties usually require warm days but cold and humid nights. The name \"Nepenthes\" was first published in 1737 in Carolus Linnaeus's \"Hortus Cliffortianus\".\nNepenthes traps contain a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or syrupy and is used to drown prey. The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high, even when significantly diluted by water, as inevitably happens in wet conditions. Many species of \"Nepenthes\" produce two different forms of pitchers. Near the base of the plant are the large lower traps, which usually sit on the ground, while the upper pitchers may be smaller, coloured differently, and have different shapes and features than the lower pitchers. \nThe lower part of the trap contains glands which take nutrients from captured insects.\nOne of the earliest pictures of \"Nepenthes\" appears in Leonard Plukenet's \"Almagestum Botanicum\" of 1696. The plant, called \"Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium\", is without doubt a \"N. distillatoria\"."}

The manga began its run in 2002, monthly in \"Monthly Sh\u014dnen Jump\". The manga talks about the story and the adventures of Kurohime and the others friends to fight the Gods of their lands and to resurrect the true love of her, the man who sacrificed his life for her, \"Zero\".\nKurohime has 14 volumes (on 2008) and is ongoing.\nMagic.\nMagic in this world is used by Gods and by some kind of humanans, called witches (whether they are men or women). The magic used by th witches can be showed under many forms, for example can be mixed with human technology, for example a gun or a rifle. A common use of magic mixes with human technology for example is when Kurohime, shot with her gun, magic bullets, that can invoke magical beasts as dragon or a demon.\nCharacters.\nZero - A boy saved by Kurohime in his childhood. Over ten years, he trained and became a gunslinger. He uses 4 guns and is known for his incredible speed. He does not use his guns for killing and only uses them to help people. Zero doesn't use the magic, often is used by Kurohime for to mix magic with technology. Zero loves truly Kurohime and in a part of series he will sacrifice his life for to save Kurohime.\nKurohime - A magician who fights using magical bullets. Ten years ago, she saves Zero, influencing his decision to become a gunslinger. She is very self-centered, and is said to not be able to genuinely love. As a result, she defied the gods and was cursed to walk the world as a child. She can only revert to her adult form when she falls in love. When a child, she is addressed as Himeko, and her magic powers are greatly hindered. The adult Kurohime bears a strong resemblance to the goddess that cursed her (In fact, they are both the same. Kurohime was split into 2 in her battle against the gods; one of \"good\" which holds all of her love and care and memories, and the other holding her \"bad\" side, which has no memories, except the anger and hatred. The latter is the current Kurohime, while the former is the \"goddess\" who gave her the curse.) She is also extremely beautiful and believes all men are her \"dogs\". Still, she has feelings for Zero, even if she won't admit it. Her name translates to \"Black Princess\" (Kuro is black and hime is princess). Her chief weapon is her witch-gun, \"Senryu\" (which, when translated means Tornado Dragon). Aside from being able to fire witch-bullets, Senryu can fire normal bullets with cannon-like force. In the second arc, Himeko receives the Yamato-Dachi from Yamatohime after defeating Gandhara. The sword fuses with Senryu, allowing it to switch between sword (Yamato Senryuto) and gun (Yamato Senryuho) forms.\nHimeko- Kurohime's form as a child, she differs greatly from her adult self, besides the fact that she is adorable and cute while her adult self is sexy and beautiful. Himeko is hyperactive and acts like a real child, often falling asleep for naps, while as her adult form is more controlled and calm. Himeko is unable to use strong magic, for example when she tries to evoke a dragon, it comes just a funny little dragon, really useless.\nOnimaru - A heavyset gunslinger that he felt betrayed by Kurohime/Himeko. When she was bad, Kurohime used him and his troops for to build a tower for to fight Gods, after then Kurohime betrayed Onimaru. He was once her most loyal soldier and his back bears a large tattoo of the Kanji for \"Dog\" and \"Kurohime\". In the middle of series Onimaru will be cursed by a demon and will be transformed in a little lizard.\nAsura - A beautiful looking woman. The people of that land call her and her kind, demons. She is extremely powerful, possessing incredible magical powers, whose destructive properties rivals a god. She is first introduced as a mysterious character who plays a subtle hand in aiding Kurohime and Zero defeat a witch.\nSword- The leader of the death angel squad (Shinigami Tenshidan) sent after Kurohime and Zero in the fourth volume. She and her comrades (Axe, Lance, Mace, Hammer, and Dagger) are sent to reap a group of vengeful souls from a ghost wagon who were revived courtesy of Kurohime. Sword seems to have a personal sense of revenge against Kurohime.\nDarkray- The former God of Death. He fought Kurohime when she first challenged the gods. Using the soul of an infant murdered by an attack on Kurohime as a shield, he defeated her with Sword, slicing her in half. He was also the one who suggested splitting Kurohime into two beings: one comprised of pure hate, the other, of love and compassion. This resulted in the birth of Shirohime (White Princess)the Goddess of Mercy. He later appears in the fourth volume.\nYashahime- The mother goddess and lover of Darkray. She swears to kill Kurohime to avenge the fallen God of Death, and first appears when Kurohime killed Gandhara on Yamato. She is very powerful and she tried to kill Zero's soul.She is actually jealous of the love zero and Kurohime share, and uses Darkray's skull to turn Zero into the god of death, so as to make Kurohime experience hell on earth forever.\nYamatohime- The Phoenix Suzaku, Devil God, and Spirit Queen of Fire. She is Asura's master. She had been imprisoned by the gods in the depths of a volcano, under constant watch by the Demon God Gandhara."}

The four players have not always been the same people: there have been some changes to the group, but it is one of the world's longest lasting string quartets. In 2005 they celebrated their 60th anniversary. Until he retired in 2007 the cellist Valentin Berlinsky had almost always been the cellist of the quartet.\nWhen they started they were known as the Moscow Philharmonic Quartet. In 1955 the quartet changed its name to Borodin Quartet, named after the composer Alexander Borodin who composed two famous string quartets.\nThey often got invitations to play in the West, but the Soviet communist government would not allow them to travel out of their country. The quartet had to accept the concerts that their government allowed them to do. They played at the funerals of the dictator Stalin and the composer Sergei Prokofiev which were on the same day (both men died on 5 March 1953. However, they were not paid anything for either event.\nThe quartet knew the composer Dmitri Shostakovich very well. They performed his quartets, and Shostakovich often listened to them practising and discussed with them the way he wanted them to be played. The quartet often played piano quintets with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter.\nWhen they started in 1945 their cellist was Mstislav Rostropovich. Rudolf Barshai was their viola player. Very soon afterwards Rostropovich found he had too many other engagements, so he got Valentin Berlinsky to be their cellist. The four men who then formed the quartet signed an oath in their own blood that they would be faithful and stay together as a group. They stayed together for 20 years. Then Rostislav Dubinsky, the first violinist, defected to the West and the second violinist, Jaroslav Alexandrov, retired because of bad health. With two new players, the quartet spend two years practising together before they performed again in public.\nWhen Communism collapsed and the Soviet Union broke up, the quartet still continued to be very famous. They travelled abroad a lot, performing in places such as London. \nThey have made many recordings including all Shostakovich's string quartets and all Beethoven quartets."}

Once he became Pope, Piccolomini had the entire village rebuilt as an ideal Renaissance town.

It runs for from Tywyn on the Mid-Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn. The line was opened in 1866 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn. It was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage. Despite severe under-investment, the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers. \nSince preservation, the railway has operated as a tourist attraction. It has increased the amount of rolling stock it has. It has done this by buying and building new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place. This included a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.\nThe fictional Skarloey Railway was based on the Talyllyn Railway. This fictional railway formed part of the Railway Series of children's books by The Rev. W. Awdry. The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\".\nName and gauge.\nThe origin of the railway's name is uncertain. It could refer to the parish of Talyllyn, which contains its eastern terminus. Or it could come from Tal-y-llyn. Tal-y-llyn is a large glacial ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris further east. The gauge of the track is unusual. It was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the nearby Corris Railway (which predated the Talyllyn), and the subsequent Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway.\nHistory.\nOrigins and construction: up to 1866.\nSlate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s. Although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region. It was at Bryn Eglwys, north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s. By 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal. They were then transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi (also known as Aberdovey). Finally they were loaded into seagoing vessels. This was a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output. In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England. As a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire. In 1859 he purchased a house near Dolgellau, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company. The company leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of Machynlleth.\nMcConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. In 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth however. In 1863 this railway had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn. This was the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29\u00a0Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 186., The company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.\nTyler's report led to an unusual alteration. It was discovered that the loading gauge of the line was too small. The internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway's passenger carriages were wide. This left less than clearance on either side, which was less than the minimum required clearance of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges. This would allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors and mean that passengers could get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway. This feature is however shared with the neighbouring Corris Railway, though for different reasons. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.\u00a01 suffered from excessive \"vertical motion\" and No.\u00a02 was said to suffer from \"horizontal oscillation\". No.\u00a01 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang. The springs on No.\u00a02 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.\nSuccess after McConnel: 1886-1880s.\nThe railway opened with two locomotives, one was a carriage and the other carried goods. They were ran under a \"one engine in steam\" rule to make sure they did not crash into each other. At the beginning, locomotives were kept in a shed made of wood at Ty Dwr at the Abergynolwyn station. This was when the main engineering department of the Tayllyn was being built at . The engineering department opened up on February 17 1867.\nWhen Talyllyn opened there were two train stations it visited, one at Pendre and the other at Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the station at opened. In 1873, and stations opened. Eventually, a line that ran from the Abergynolwyn station to the actual village of Abergynolwyn was opened. People could take an incline down a hill from the station to the town. From there, people could take a one of the many trams that ran through the village. Supplies like coal, building materials, and other things were sent down the incline from the train station to the village.\nThe railway used steam locomotives when it opened. The two original locomotives were made by Fletcher, Jennings &amp; Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria. Both of them are still used today but many of the parts inside and outside have been replaced. Talyllyn has a rare gauge. This is thought to match the gauge at Corris Railway. The locomotives at Talyllyn might be the oldest of their kind for making sure they fit that type of gauge. The locomotives, \"Talyllyn\" and \"Dolgoch\" used to carry slate from the quarry at Tywyn. It also carried other things. Trains that carried people, called passenger trains, traveled between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre. Men who worked on the quarries also traveled on trains, despite those trains not being able to be used by the public. Those trains traveled from Abergynolwyn to Alltwyllt and into Nant Gwernol.\nThe line was very successful when it opened. As of 1880, 300 people worked in the local slate industry. Over of slate was sent by train each year. Over 11,500 people first road the trains in 1867. By 1877, over 23,000 people were using the train.\nLess money is made: 1880s-1910.\nStarting in the 1880s, the \"Grand Tour\" was popular with people visiting the area, called tourists. People could take the Talyllyn and Corris trains and go through Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris. Then, when they returned, they could use Cambrian Railways trains. The need for slate slowed down for the last twenty years of the 1880s. Many quarries fired people or closed. Even the quarries that dug up more slate due to other quarries closing often closed eventually. This made the need for the trains less, and made the railroad companies make less money.\nHaydn Jones : 1911-1950.\nEventually, the biggest quarry in the area, Bryn Eglwys closed. Most of the people who had jobs in Abergynolwyn worked at that quarry. Many people were hurt by the closure. A man who lived in Abergynolwyn, named Henry Haydn Jones bought Bryn Eglwys. He also became a MP for the Liberal representing Merioneth. The quarry, which had closed, reopened in January 1911. Haydn Jones had no money to put into the quarry. But, when workers started mining in the quarry they pulled slate from the \"Broad Vein\" section. That section had slate that was very hard. It was not popular and most people did not want to buy it. They stopped getting slate from the Broad Vein and started getting slate from the \"Narrow Vein,\" which had slate that was softer and that people wanted to buy. It was very expensive to build a new mind in the Narrow Vein. So, to save money, Haydn Jones made very small entrances into the mine, which were considered unsafe by many people. The sales of slate rose during World War I because people started building new buildings after they were destroyed in the war.\nAfter the war ended, and after 1920, people started traveling more to see the sights of Britain. The number of people who wrote on the Talyllyn rose and places that once stored slate were used to seat people, instead. Tourists could even rent slate wagons, which were used to transport slate only, as a fun thing to experience. A Gravity railway was used to move people on the wagons. People were no longer able to ride in the wagons as of the 1930s. Tourists brought more money into the area and helped the railway survive, but, Haydn Jones never made money. \nThe rental contract on Bryn Eglwys ended in 1942. But, Haydn Jones could renew it each year. People were still visiting the area as tourists. In October 1942, two return trains ran on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The trip was 45 minutes long one way. They did not let people ride the trains on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. In 1946, the was a collapse in Bryn Eglwys. The quarry was called unsafe and people could not use it. It was closed. Haydn Jones kept running the railway and said he would do so until he died. In 1947, most of the railroads in Britain were bought by the government. Talyllyn remained owned by Haydn Jones. Between 1947 and 1949, people could ride the train two days a week. Haydn Jones died on July 2 1950. The railway kept running until October 6.\nPreservation.\nSaving the railway: 1951-1960.\nIn 1949, Tom Rolt, who was a writer, visited the railway. David Curwen, who was a locomotive engineer, visited with him. In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the \"Birmingham Post\". He told them that it was important to rescue Talyllyn. Many people had interest in this. On October 11 1950, a meeting was held about it in Birmingham at the Imperial Hotel. About 70 people attended. Rolt told them that he thought they should make a committee, or a team, to look into buying the railway. The committee met again on October 23. They met with the people who ran Haydn Jones' finances after he had died.\nIt was very hard due to the law to make the committee the owners of the railway. Both the committee and Haydn Jones' people thought it was a good idea to have Jones' stop being the owner. They decided to make a new company, called Talyllyn Holdings, the owner. The company was a mix of people from the committee and from Jones' group. The company started running the railway on February 8 1951. They changed the name of the company to a non-profit called the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society. The Society started to advertise that they wanted to save the railway and asked for people to donate money. They also wanted to find people to volunteer to help run the railway. By May, almost 650 people had donated and became members of the Society. The railway re-opened on Whit Monday, on May 14 1951. Trains ran between Wharf and Rhydyronen. Starting on June 4, trains ran daily until the summer. David Curwen was the Chief Mechanical Engineer.\nWhen the railway re-opened again it needed a lot of work done to it to fix things and update it. They bought two more steam locomotives from Corris Railway in 1951. They were named \"Sir Haydn\" and \"Edward Thomas\". In 1951, \"Sir Haydn\" became the first new locomotive to travel on Talyllyn Railway in over 80 years. It derailed a lot because the Talyllyn Railway was slightly wider than the Corris Railway. Eventually this was fixed by changing the width of the railway and changing parts of the locomotive wheels. The \"Edward Thomas\" needed a lot of service, but it was too expensive to fix. A man who was on the Preservation Society board of directors, John Alcock, had his company, the Hunslet Engine Company fix it for free.\nAnother locomotive was donated to the Society by an engineering company in Birmingham called Abelsons Limited. The locomotive was named \"Douglas\". It was built for the depot railway and was used by the RAF Calshot until 1945. It started being used by the public in 1954. Through the 1950s volunteers and Society staff members helped fix the railway tracks.\nOn May 22 1957, the BBC produced a live television program at the railway. Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon road the train from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. As a result of the television program, more people used the train. Over 57,000 people road the train that summer. The money that those people paid helped the Society improve the railway. In 1958, the original \"Talyllyn\" locomotive was put back in service.\nAt the Tywyn Wharf train station a museum was opened. It is called the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. The first object that was displayed at the museum was the Guinness Brewery locomotive. It was donated to the museum in 1952. The museum opened in 1956."}

With a total enrollment of 5,848, Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League.\nThe college was established in 1769 by Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock who wanted to use the college to Christianize the Native Americans. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,\" citing \"Trustees of Dartmouth College v.

Dartmouth alumni, from Daniel Webster to the many donors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have been famously involved in their college.\nDartmouth is on a rural 269-acre (1.1\u00a0km\u00b2) campus in the Upper Valley region of New Hampshire. Given the College's isolated location, participation in athletics and the school's Greek system is high. Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.

The club plays its games at Boundary Park in Oldham, England.\nThe club has never won any major trophies through their history, though have made several appearances in the late rounds of the FA Cup and Football League Cup.\nHistory.\nThe club was created as Pine Villa Football Club in 1895, but changed to the current name in 1899. Almost immediately, Oldham became a professional team before joining the Football League in 1907. After struggling between the First World War and the Second World War, they became more stable in 1969\u2014when legendary manager Jimmy Frizzell took over. Under Frizzell, the club won 200 of their 544 competitive games and were promoted to higher levels twice.\nAfter leaving in the summer of 1982, Joe Royle took over as the club's manager during which time Oldham again had a successful period. Under Royle, the club won 225 games of 608\u2014a slightly higher winning percentage than under Frizzell. In the early 1990s, under Royle, Oldham reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the Football League Cup, losing every time. However, in the 1990\u201391 season, the club won the Football League Second Division and were promoted to the First Division for the first time in over 70\u00a0years. In the 1992\u201393 season, Oldham was a group of 24 teams that were the founding members of the Premier League\u2014England's top division of football. After Royle's departure to Everton F.C., Oldham struggled and were relegated twice in four seasons.\nIn the early 2000s, Oldham Athletic almost went bankrupt. Businessman Chris Moore decided to purchase the club, promising to return to the Premier League within five years. However, later that season, he left the club, which also left behind much debt and a weak team. However, another businessman purchased the club in 2004, saving them from liquidation. In the 2006\u201307, under current manager John Sheridan, Oldham almost were promoted to the Football Championship, but lost in the semi-final of the play-offs."}

It was shown in 1974. Although only 13 episodes were made, it was so popular that it was repeated regularly until 1987. The series was made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate through their company Smallfilms.\nThe character Bagpuss was a toy cat. Bagpuss was described in each programme as \"an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams\".\nEach programme began in the same way. It started by looking through old sepia photographs as these words were spoken:\nThere was a shop called \u201cBagpuss &amp; Co\u201d. The cat sat in the shop window. The owner of the shop was a little girl named Emily. The shop did not sell anything. Instead, Emily would find things that were broken and lost. She fixed them and put them in the shop window. Emily hoping that the owners of the things would come and get them. She would leave the fixed thing in front of her favourite toy: the stuffed cat Bagpuss. Each programme began with these words:\nWhen Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme changed from sepia to colour film, and the toys in the shop would come to life. There was Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine, and a wooden woodpecker which was a bookend (something to stop a row of books falling over) called Professor Yaffle. Professor Yaffle spoke like a clever professor. He had a German accent and wore a pince-nez. He would look at the object and tell the audience what it was used for. There were also some mice. They lived in the \u201cmouse organ\u201d (a pun on the word mouthorgan). The mouse organ played music and the mice squeaked in high voices. All the voices except those of Madeleine and Gabriel were done by Oliver Postgate who also wrote the stories.\nAt the end of the programme, Bagpuss would yawn again and fall asleep. The colour changed back to sepia and the toys became toys again as these words were spoken:"}
{"id": "147540", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147540", "title": "Oliver Postgate", "text": "Richard Oliver Postgate (12 April 1925\u00a0\u2013 8 December 2008), generally known as Oliver Postgate, was an English animator, puppeteer and writer.\nHe made several series of children\u2019s programmes for British television. They all became very popular. They include \"Pingwings\", \"Pogles' Wood\", \"Noggin the Nog\", \"Ivor the Engine\", \"Clangers\" and \"Bagpuss\". They were all made by Smallfilms, the company he set up with Peter Firmin. They were shown on the BBC between the 1950s and the 1980s, and on ITV from 1959 to the present day. In a 1999 poll, \"Bagpuss\" was voted the most popular children's television programme of all time.\nHis life.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in Hendon, Middlesex, England. He went to Woodstock School and Woodhouse County Secondary School in London. When World War II started he was evacuated to Devon and he finished his studies at Dartington Hall School. He refused to fight in the war, so he was sent to prison. However, he was soon let out because he volunteered to be a stretcher bearer for the Red Cross.\nIn 1948 he trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but he never became a professional actor. He was more interested in animation. He created the character of a pig made out of cardboard that played the violin. The BBC were not interested in his idea. Seven years later he joined the ITV London company Associated-Rediffusion as a stage manager. He worked on children\u2019s programmes and made props. \nTelevision programmes.\nPostgate thought he could make better programmes than the ones he was working on, so he created \"Alexander the Mouse\", a story about a mouse that was born to be king. Postgate met an artist called Peter Firmin. He was good at drawing animation characters. The two men started to work together and for 30 years they created their well-known television series, running their own company called Smallfilms. The characters in their stories were moved by magnets under a table. They created \"The Saga of Noggin the Nog\" (1959-1965). It was based on old Norse legends. Then came \"The Seal of Neptune\" (1960), a story about horses that lived under the sea. They created \"The Pogles\" which was about a witch, but after the first broadcast it was thought to be too frightening for children. Then came \"The Clangers\" (1969-1974 which was their first colour production. Their most famous creation was \"Bagpuss\", the story of a toy cat made of rags that sat in a shop window.\nIn 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded an honorary degree to Postgate. Postgate said that it should really be Bagpuss who got the degree. He later showed Bagpuss wearing academic dress\nPersonal life.\nPostgate married Prudence Myers in 1957, becoming stepfather to her three children The couple had twin boys in 1959 and another son in 1964. Prudence died in 1982. Naomi Linnell was his partner in the last years of his life.\nHe wrote an autobiography \"Seeing Things\" which was published in 2000. In his book he looked back at the programmes he made. He explained why they were so popular by saying: \u201cThey are simple, and they are well-founded in a safe place. They are full of fun and, like a good meal, they are rich and satisfying.\u201d\nReferences.\nObituary to Oliver Postgate, The Independent, 10 Dec 2008 p.\u00a034"}

She is played by Catherine Tate. She is a secretary from Chiswick, London. She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor. She appears in one scene at the end of the last episode of the 2006 series, \"Doomsday\" (named in the credits only as \"The Bride\"), and in the second Christmas special, \"The Runaway Bride\". The character returned as The Doctor's full-time companion for the whole of the fourth series in 2008.\nCharacter history.\nDuring the 2006 series Christmas episode \"The Runaway Bride\", Donna Noble is a temporary secretary at H.C. Clements in London, a security firm which, unknown to her, concealed the Torchwood Institute up until its collapse following the events of \"Doomsday\", and was then taken over by an alien intelligence. Her parents are Geoff and Sylvia Noble.\nOn Christmas Eve, the day of her wedding, she is accidentally pulled into the TARDIS because she has been drugged with Huon particles by her fianc\u00e9, Lance Bennett, because he was told to do so by Empress of the Racnoss. She aids the Doctor in defeating the Racnoss Empress, but says no to his invitation to travel with him \u2014 she is frightened not only by his adventures, but also by the Doctor himself. Having seen him commit genocide on the Racnoss, she urges him to find a new companion to act as his moral support. It was revealed later in \"Turn Left\" that the Doctor would have been killed while stopping the Racnoss if Donna was not there.\nReappearing in April 2008's Series four premiere, \"Partners in Crime\", Donna has become dissatisfied with regular life and more interested in the bigger picture. She regrets declining the Doctor's offer and has been investigating unusual phenomena in the hopes of finding the Doctor for some time. When investigating Miss Foster and Adipose Industries, the Londoner and the Time Lord are finally re-united. She expresses her regret to the Doctor for not joining him and after stopping Foster's plans to convert the whole of London into Adipose children she joins him in the TARDIS as a regular companion. She makes it explicit, however, that she has no romantic attachment to him as Martha Jones and Rose Tyler did.\nIn \"The Fires of Pompeii\", Donna continually argues with the Doctor over the moral issue of whether or not he should save the inhabitants of Pompeii from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius the next day. Ultimately, they are forced to cause the eruption to happen, weighing the destruction of the city against the fate of the whole world.\nDonna was the Doctor's full time companion for all 13 episodes of Series 4. Her return to the series sees her with her maternal grandfather, recurring character Wilfred Mott, as well as her mother, Sylvia. Mott is played by Bernard Cribbins, whose appearance as a newspaper seller in Voyage of the Damned was merged into his new role following the death of Howard Attfield who played Donna's father in \"The Runaway Bride\". Donna has encountered the Racnoss, the Adipose, the Pyroviles, the Ood, the Sontarans, The Hath, Vespiforms, the Vashta Nerada, the Judoon, the Shadow Proclamation, and the Daleks. \nIn the final episode of the fourth series Journey's End the Doctor erased Donna's memory of him and left her on Earth. He warned that she'd \"burn up\" if she remembered him.\nDonna is involved in The End Of Time. At Donna's Marriage, The Doctor gives Sylvia a winning Lottery ticket before moving on to meet the first of his companions, Rose Tyler."}

He is an evil Time Lord and is one of the biggest enemies of the Doctor.\nWhen the Master first appeared in 1971, he was played by Roger Delgado. Delgado continued in the role until his death in 1973. Afterwards, Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers played a decayed version of the Time Lord, until Anthony Ainley assumed the part in 1981. He remained until \"Doctor Who\"'s cancellation in 1989. In 1996, the Master was played by Eric Roberts in the TV movie. In the revived series, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction before handing over to John Simm, who portrayed the Master in the end of the 2007 series. Michelle Gomez took over the role in 2014.\nHistory in the show.\nThe Master was once a childhood friend of the Doctor. In \"The Sound of Drums\" (2007), there is a brief clip of the young Master as the Doctor talks about his childhood. When they joined the Time Lord Academy at the age of eight, they were taken to look into the \"Untempered Schism\". This was a portal through which you could see the time vortex (the tunnel the TARDIS travels through as it travels in time) and see the full power of the Time Lords. He suggests that this is what made the Master go mad.\nA would-be universal conqueror, the Master wants to control the universe (in \"The Deadly Assassin\" his ambitions were becoming \"the master of all matter\", and in \"The Sound of Drums\" he acknowledges that he chose his own name). His most distinctive ability is that of hypnotising people by fixing them with an intense stare, often accompanied by the phrase, \"I am the Master, and you will obey me.\"\nSome suspect that a character known as the War Chief in the episode \"The War Games\" is actually the Master in disguise. However, this has not been confirmed.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey. This is mentioned several times in different stories (\"The Five Doctors\", \"The Sea Devils\" and \"Terror of the Autons\"). In the 2007 episode \"Utopia\", the Doctor calls the disguised Master a genius and shows an immense admiration for his intellect before discovering who he is.\nBoth the Doctor and the Master have been shown to be skilled hypnotists, although the Master's capacity to dominate \u2013 even by stare and voice alone \u2013 has been shown to be far more pronounced. The Master is also known to always survive death with no explanation other than \"I escaped.\"\nTARDIS.\nIn the original \"Doctor Who\" series, the Master's TARDISes have fully functioning chameleon circuits and have appeared as many things.\nBy the time of the new series, it is unclear whether any of the Master's TARDISes still exist. In \"Rise of the Cybermen\", the Tenth Doctor claims that his TARDIS is the last one in existence although at the time of his saying this, he also thought he was the last Time Lord. In \"Utopia\", the Master resorts to stealing the Doctor's TARDIS, with no explanation of how he travelled from the Time War to the end of the universe.\nOther appearances.\nThe Master has also been featured in spin-offs of the series, which are of unclear canonicity and may not take place in the same continuity. The Master in these stories is, nevertheless, recognisably the same person.\nOne of the most important of these other appearances is David A. McIntee's \"Master trilogy\" of novels comprising \"The Dark Path\" and \"First Frontier\" in the Virgin Publishing lines and \"The Face of the Enemy\" for BBC Books, and the \"Doctor Who\" audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, in which Geoffrey Beevers has once again played the Master. Alex MacQueen has also played the Master in Big Finish audio dramas.\nComic strips.\nThe Master returns in a new body and guise, that of a street preacher, in the previously mentioned \"Doctor Who Magazine\" (DWM) comic strip story \"The Fallen\", although the Doctor does not recognise him. The Master reveals himself a few stories later, in \"The Glorious Dead\" (DWM 287-296). The Master had survived the events of the television movie by encountering a cosmic being named Esterath in the time vortex. Esterath controls the Glory, the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence. The Master's scheme to take control of the Glory fails, and he is banished to parts unknown (see Kroton). \nIn \"Character Assassin\" (DWM 311), the Delgado Master visits the Land of Fiction and steals part of the technology behind it, wiping out several nineteenth century fictional villains as he goes. He can also be seen in the following comic strips set during the Pertwee era:\nRole playing game.\nThe \"Doctor Who\" role-playing game published by FASA in 1985 has two modules that give information about the Master. The modules identify the Meddling Monk as an alias the Master has used in the past."}

He played with the world-famous Borodin Quartet from 1945 when it was founded, and was a member until he retired in 2007.\nHis life.\nEarly life.\nValentin Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk, Siberia. His father had learned the violin with the famous teacher Leopold Auer. He had formed his own string quartet, the Berlinksy Quartet, who had played in many parts of the Soviet Union. Valentin learned the violin from his father. Soon he was sent to Moscow where he studied the cello and played with the Moscow Youth Orchestra. He played in a student concert together with Mstislav Rostropovich in 1938.\nFor many years Berlinsky taught the cello at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow. He did not often perform as soloist. He preferred being a member of a chamber music group.\nThe Borodin Quartet.\nIn 1945 four young players formed a string quartet called the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet. Mstislav Rostropovich was the cellist, Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai played the violins and Rudolf Barshai played the viola. However, after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy, so he suggested that Berlinsky should take his place. The four players that now formed the quartet signed an oath that they would be loyal and stay together as a group. They signed the oath with their own blood. Valentin often showed this piece of paper to people. For 60 years he kept a careful record of all the concerts they played. They called themselves the Borodin Quartet after the composer Alexander Borodin.\nThe four musicians first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946. They became famous for playing his string quartets. Shostakovich was to compose 15 string quartets. The Borodin Quartet were the most famous string quartet in the Soviet Union, but it was difficult for them to get permission to play in other countries until the fall of the Soviet Union.\nLast years.\nValentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007. His place was taken by his pupil, Vladimir Balshin, but Berlinsky still continued to help the quartet. \nHe died on 15 December 2008, in Moscow, after a long illness. His daughter Lyudmila is a pianist."}

{"id": "147630", "revid": "311545", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147630", "title": "Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz)", "text": "The Symphonie fantastique is a symphony written by the French composer Hector Berlioz. It is one of the most famous Romantic works for orchestra. The official title of the piece is Episode de la Vie d\u2019un Artiste (An Episode in the Life of the Artist), but it is always called by its subtitle \"Symphonie Fantastique\" which means \"Fantasy Symphony\". The \u201cFantasy\u201d refers to the story that is described by them music. (\"Fantasy Symphony\" is a better translation than \"Fantastic Symphony\" because \"fantastique\" is not like the modern meaning of the English word \"fantastic\").\nThe symphony lasts about 45 minutes and is divided into 5 movements. Berlioz himself wrote down the story that the music describes, just as Beethoven had done with his \"Sixth Symphony\". Berlioz\u2019s work is about a young artist. In the music the young artist is represented by a tune. This tune is often heard during the symphony. That is why it is called an \u201c\"id\u00e9e fixe\"\u201d, which means a \u201cfixed idea\u201d, i.e. an idea that keeps coming again and again. An \"id\u00e9e fixe\" is what Wagner would have called a leitmotif (a tune which is always used to describe a particular person or thing in a piece of music). The first performance took place at the Paris Conservatoire in December 1830. Berlioz made several changes to the music between 1831 and 1845.\nThe instruments used.\nThe symphony is played by an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets (1st doubling E-flat clarinet), 4 bassoons, 4 French horns, 2 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, 2 ophicleides (originally one ophicleide and one serpent), 2 pairs of timpani, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, bells in C and G, 2 harps, and strings.\nThe story.\nThe symphony is an example of programme music because it describes something apart from the music. In this case it describes a story. This is what the composer wrote:\nFirst movement:\n\"A young artist was deeply in love with a girl who did not love him. He felt so desperately sad that he tried to poison himself with opium. He did not take enough to kill him. It just made him fall into a deep sleep. In this sleep he imagined all sorts of things. His beloved came to him in a dream. She changes into a musical theme (the \"id\u00e9e fixe\") which he just cannot forget. He imagines her love and his tender feelings for her.\"\nSecond movement:\n\"He meets her at a ball. Everyone is dancing. He finds his beloved among the crowd.\"\nThird movement:\n\"In the country he hears two shepherds who call to one another on their pipes. The trees sway gently in the wind. The young artist starts to feel happier. Then he sees his beloved again. He starts to worry that she may not want him any more. The shepherd music starts again, but it is only one of the shepherds playing. The sun sets. Far away a thunderstorm is heard.\"\nThe fourth movement:\n\"He dreams that he has killed his beloved in a fit of anger. He is now being taken to the scaffold where he will have his head chopped off. A march is played as he is taken away. For a moment he thinks of his beloved again, then the axe falls and he is executed.\"\nThe fifth movement:\n\"The artist is at the Witches\u2019 Sabbath. There are lots of ghosts and monsters around who have come to watch him being buried. His beloved is heard, but her tune now sounds horrible. She has come to the Sabbath. She joins the witches and they dance while the funeral music is heard.\"\nThe first movement: R\u00eaveries - Passions (Daydreams - Passions).\nThe first movement has a slow introduction. The tune heard on the violins is already nearly like the \"id\u00e9e fixe\". The \"id\u00e9e fixe\" is heard in its full form when the music goes into the fast section. It is played by the violins and solo flute. The rhythm that the lower string instruments play underneath is very agitated. The form of the movement is not much like the traditional sonata form. Berlioz was more interested in the \"id\u00e9e fixe\" which keeps haunting the young artist all the way through.\nThe second movement: Un bal (A ball).\nThe ball (i.e. a party with dancing) is represented in the music by a lively waltz. The two harps make it sound very graceful. Twice the waltz is interrupted by the \"id\u00e9e fixe\".\nThe third movement: Sc\u00e8ne aux champs (Scene in the country).\nThe two shepherds who are playing to one another are represented by a cor anglais (sitting in the orchestra) and an oboe which is played offstage so that it sounds distant. Then the main gentle countryside theme is heard on solo flute and violins. The \"id\u00e9e fixe\" returns in the middle of the movement. The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is played by four timpani.\nThe fourth movement: Marche au supplice (March to the scaffold).\nThe movement starts with timpani rumbling and horns starting up the march theme. Then the cellos and double basses start the march in its full form, soon taken over by the violins. Just before he is executed there is a short repetition of the \"id\u00e9e fixe\" on a solo clarinet, then the axe falls (a loud chord) and his head falls into the basket (one plucked note passed from the violins, through the violas, cellos and then double basses).\nThe fifth movement: Songe d'une nuit de sabbat (Dream of a witches' Sabbath).\nThe \"id\u00e9e fixe\" has now become a \"vulgar dance tune\", it is played on the E-flat clarinet. There are lots of effects, including ghostly \"col legno\" playing in the strings, the bubbling of the witches' cauldron played by the wind instruments. As the dance reaches a climax we hear the Dies Irae (Day of Judgement) melody together with the \"Ronde du Sabbat\" (Sabbath Round) which is a wild fugue.\nHarriet Smithson.\nIn 1827 Berlioz went to a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s play \"Hamlet\". It was played in English by a theatre group from England. Berlioz fell in love with Irish actress Harriet Smithson who played the part of Ophelia, He did not actually meet her, he just saw her acting on stage, but he sent her lots of love letters, but she left Paris without meeting him. He then wrote his Symphonie Fantastique. He then wrote the symphony to describe his love for her and his unhappiness because she was not interested in him. When Harriet heard the symphony two years after it was first performed, she realized that it was a symphony about her. She eventually met Berlioz and they were married on 3 October 1833. For several years the marriage was happy, although they did not speak one another\u2019s language. However, after nine years they separated."}

They say that using clean technologies is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into mainstream business. Clean technologies are seen to be important for economic growth.\nPernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology areas: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications (such as portable fuel cells), and water filtration. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are spending billions of dollars on clean technology.\nHistory of clean tech.\nPernick and Wilder say that, in the 1970s, clean technology was considered \u201calternative\u201d. Even at the start of the 21st century, the term \"clean tech\" was not yet widely used. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is \"the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe.\"\nClean technology trends.\nPernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. The authors explain how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas. Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies, companies, and regions that are leading the way.\nThe book also explains that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, \"multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources.\" The authors also believe that \"clean coal\" is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.\nEmerging clean tech cities are seen to include Copenhagen, where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmark's electricity, and Chicago, a leader in \"green\" buildings saving energy, heating and cooling costs.\nSix C's.\nPernick and Wilder identify six major forces, which they call the six C\u2019s, that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate.\nRecent developments.\nIn a September 2007 article in \"Renewable Energy Access\" Wilder explains that, while some hurdles remain, the key solar trends mapped out in \"The Clean Tech Revolution\"\u2014scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs\u2014are coming to pass:\nFrom the Nevada desert to the roofs of Wal-Mart stores to the legendary plains of Spain, solar is entering a bold, bright new era. Each week, solar seems to be winning new enthusiasts like Forbes, new investors of all stripes, and new large-scale business users like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Kohl's. Late last month, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley signed that state's first renewable portfolio standard into law, which includes a solar set-aside.\nInvestment money is pouring in, production lines are humming and expanding, the silicon shortage is being addressed, and the long-fought challenge of bringing solar to scale (the title of a 2002 Clean Edge report) is finally showing real hope. Last month, red-hot Chinese solar wafer supplier LDK Solar (whose second-quarter revenue grew 700%) announced manufacturing expansions that would raise its production capacity above 1,600 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2009. German solar cell producer Ersol Solar Energy just inked a contract for 1 billion euros to supply Germany PV module company Solon AG for 11 years.\nErnst &amp; Young and Dow Jones VentureOne have reported that investments in clean technology companies in the first half of 2007 have reached $1.1 billion. The research found that clean technology investments are poised to increase by more than 35% in 2007 compared with 2006. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are now making multi-billion dollar investments in clean technology."}

He is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. Hansen is best known for his research in the field of climatology, his testimony on climate change to congressional committees in the 1980s that helped raise broad awareness of the global warming issue, and his continuing advocacy of action to limit the impacts of climate change. He has been a critic of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush Administration's stances on climate change.\nHansen studied astronomy and physics in the 1960s at the University of Iowa. He did scientific research on the atmospheres of other planets, and later Earth's atmosphere. Hansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 and he received a US$250,000 Heinz Environment Award\nfor his research on global warming in 2001. He was listed as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the (2006) list and, in 2007, he shared the US$1 million Dan David Prize. On April 5, 2008, Dr. Hansen received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his outstanding achievements in science.\nHansen posited in a 2007 paper that 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point. The current record level is 389 ppm of CO2, an almost 40-percent increase from the pre-industrial revolution level of 278 ppm. In 1988 the Earth's atmosphere surpassed the 350 ppm mark, while global CO2 emissions per capita rose.\nHansens strong public opposition to the exploitation of oil sands and the pipeline project created some controversy in the media. \"Storms of My Grandchildren\" is Hansen's first book about the climate change. In 2013, Hansen was co-author of an open letter saying \"continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.\" "}

It was the first Disney animated feature to start at #1 in the box office since \"Pocahontas\". It was the first to have a production budget of $100 million since \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".\nPlot.\nA British couple and their baby son has survived a shipwreck. They become stranded off the African coast near uncharted jungles. The couple builds a treehouse to live in. They are later attacked and killed by a vicious leopard called Sabor. Meanwhile, a family of gorillas are travelling to their feeding grounds. One of them is Kala, whose own child was killed by the leopard. She hears the cries of the orphaned baby. She follows the sound across the jungle to the treehouse. She finds the child there. Sabor attacks her, but Kala and the baby escape without being hurt. They return to the gorilla family. Kala decides to raise the child as her own. She names him Tarzan. That makes her mate Kerchak angry. He tells her the baby will never replace the child they lost.\nAs a child, Tarzan makes friends with several animals and other gorillas in the family. They include the female ape Terk and the male elephant Tantor. Tarzan has trouble keeping up. One day, Terk and her friends dare Tarzan to get a hair from an elephant's tail. The dare goes wrong when the elephants stampede into the gorilla territory and almost kill a baby gorilla. However, Tarzan is able to get the hair. After Kerchak tells Kala that Tarzan will never be one of the family, Tarzan runs off into the jungle. Kala consoles him. He keeps trying. He learns how to do things from the animals of the jungle. He becomes a muscular apelike man. One day, Sabor attacks the gorillas and Tarzan kills her. This makes Kerchak respect him.\nA gunshot is heard. While the others go into the jungle, Tarzan decides to investigate. He sees a team of human explorers. The group includes Professor Porter, his daughter Jane and their hunter guide Clayton. They are in Africa looking for gorillas. Jane gets separated from the group. She is attacked by a troop of baboons. Tarzan saves her from them. He discovers that Jane and he are the same-humans. They go back to Jane's camp. Terk, Tantor and some gorillas from the troop are looking for Tarzan. They find the human campsite. They use the various items in the camp as instruments, and slowly destroy it. Tarzan and Jane arrive at the camp. When Clayton and Professor Porter get there, Tarzan goes with the gorillas into the jungle. Kerchak warns the other gorillas to stay away from the humans, but Tarzan says that the humans are not dangerous. He secretly continues his visits to the explorers. He learns about the human world. He and Jane fall in love.\nWhen the explorer's boat arrives to take them back to England, Tarzan is sad to see Jane leaving. Clayton tricks Tarzan into believing that Jane will remain in Africa forever if he shows her the gorillas. Tarzan persuades Tantor and Terk to lead Kerchak away from the explorers. The plan seemingly works and Tarzan leads the explorers to the gorilla nesting grounds. The explorers are happy to mingle with the apes, but then Kerchak arrives and attacks the humans. Tarzan restrains him to save the explorers and leaves the troop, having alienated himself. When Kala finds him, staring off into the distance, she takes him to the treehouse where she found him as a baby. Tarzan then decides to go to England with the explorers.\nThe next day, as the group board the ship, a mutiny occurs and Tarzan and his friends are captured and detained in the brig, but not before Clayton reveals that he came to Africa to capture the gorillas and sell them to a zoo. He and his goons then enter the jungle and start capturing the gorillas. Fortunately, Tarzan and his friends escape with the aid of several animals from the jungle. Together, they free the gorillas and retaliate against the poachers. Clayton then shoots Tarzan, but only grazes his arm. When Kerchak comes to the ape man's aid, Clayton shoots him, but fatally injures him. He then chases Tarzan into the trees where a fight ensues. Tarzan briefly holds Clayton at gunpoint, before destroying the hunter's rifle. Clayton then attacks the ape man with a machete and starts wildly hacking vines, not knowing that one of them is round his neck like a noose. Despite Tarzan begging him to stop, he cuts the vines and the hunter is quickly hung to death.\nTarzan then approaches Kerchak, who is close to death. Kerchak then asks Tarzan to forgive him for not realising he has always been a member of the gorilla troop and passes his leadership on to Tarzan, before succumbing to his injuries. The ape man then becomes the new leader of the gorillas. The next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave. Jane then realises she loves Tarzan and she and her father then decide to remain in Africa. Tarzan and Jane then embark on their new life together.\nTelevision.\nA spin-off television animated series named \"The Legend of Tarzan\" ran from 2001 to 2003. The series picks up where the movie left off. Tarzan is adjusting to his new role as leader of the apes following Kerchak's death.\nSequels.\nDirect-to-video sequels:\nAwards.\n\"Tarzan\" won the following awards:\nAnnie Awards.\n\"Tarzan\" was also nominated for 11 Annie Awards, winning one."}

We now know all we are ever going to know about the 9/11 attacks and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Likewise, that the Earth is round (as opposed to flat) has so much evidence that denying it is simply irrational.\nTheir growth.\nThere has been a growth in recent years in conspiracy theories proposed on the internet. Conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become common in mass media, and particularly on the internet. Conspiracy emerged as a cultural phenomenon in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\nIt is worth remembering that conspiracy theorists get paid by websites according to how many viewers they attract. Websites that seem free to the user are paid for by adverts, usually quite harmless, though they may be annoying. The point is that the people who put up the individual articles get paid once the number of viewers is over a certain qualifying number.\nDavid Grimes has calculated that it takes at least three years to expose a conspiracy on the internet, depending on the number of people involved. Many conspiracies would be exposed in between three and four years."}

They live in eastern Indonesia, Maluku, Papua New Guinea, Torres Strait Islands, and eastern Australia. Best known are the members of the genus \"Paradisaea\", including the type species, the greater bird-of-paradise, \"Paradisaea apoda\".\nThey live in tropical forests like rainforests, swamps and moss forest. They build their nests from soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine monsters, typically placed in a tree fork.\nThese birds are best known for the remarkable plumage and behaviour of the males. They are an extreme example of how sexual selection works. \nFemales choose males who they instinctively see are fine specimens of their species. The colours of the plumage, the construction of the nest, the song and the mating dance all play a part. In some species the pairing is monogamous, and in others the males are polygamous. If they are monogamous, the males look much like the females. If they are polygamous, the males are very much flashier than the females. In both cases, it is the female who makes the choice of partner.\nHunting for plumes and habitat destruction have reduced some species to endangered status. Habitat destruction due to deforestation is now the main threat.\nBirds of paradise range in size from the king bird of paradise at 3\u00a0grams (1.8\u00a0oz) and 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) to the black sicklebill at 110\u00a0cm (43\u00a0in) and the curl-crested manucode at 430\u00a0grams (15.2\u00a0oz).\nBirds of paradise have bodies which look rather like a crow.

Their main suborder is the Passeri, the songbirds.\nAdaptations.\nThe passerines have a number of adaptations which, taken together, have made them highly successful, with many species around the world.\nEvolution.\nEvidence on their evolution comes from comparative anatomy, the fossil record and molecular biology. \nIt is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of Gondwana in the Palaeogene. This might have taken place around the Upper Palaeocene some 60\u201355 mya. The latest opinion on passerine evolution is that that passerines originated on the Australian landmass \u223c47 mya.\nThe early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side, and their delicate bones did not preserve well. Two specimens from Queensland, Australia are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform. They are two species of about 10 and 20\u00a0cm in overall length. This proves that some 55\u00a0mya, barely into the early Eocene, early perching birds were recognizably distinct. It also suggests that the origin of this great order of birds was in the southern continent.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are three sub-orders: \"Acanthisitti\", \"Tyranni\" and \"Passeri\". There are only two bird species in the sub-order Acanthisitti. They are known as New Zealand wrens. The sub-order Tyranni are also known as the suboscines.

They are found in two National Forest areas of Victoria, New South Wales and southeast Queensland.\nMating system.\nThey are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment. Since they live on the ground in fairly dense undergrowth, sound is used by the males to attract attention. When a female arrives, the visual display comes into action. It is a typical \"female choice\" mating system, where males defend a mating territory, and sing and display to get a mate.\nSound mimicry.\nThe lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including other birds. It takes young birds about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics, and will sing on occasion but the females do so with less skill than the males. A lyrebird classic is their imitation of human sounds in the forest such as car alarms, camera shutters and forest logging with chain-saws.\nBreeding.\nThe breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds. They can live up to thirty years. They also start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female Superb Lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males.These territories may contain the breeding places of up to eight females. In a male's territory, he makes or uses display platforms.\nThe females each build an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where each lays a single egg. She is the sole parent who incubates the egg over 50 days until it hatches, and she is also the sole carer of the lyrebird chick."}
