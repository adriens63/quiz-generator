They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors. Administrators are chosen after a successful request for adminship. As of , there are administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia. Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have.\nOn Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being \"given [or taking up] the mop\", a term which has also been used elsewhere. \nIn his book \"Wikipedia \u2013 The Missing Manual\", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. Instead, he says, admins usually \"delete pages\" and \"protect pages involved in edit wars\".\nHistory on the English Wikipedia.\nIn 2006, there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia, and in 2020 about 1,100. These administrators live in different parts of the world. \nIn July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was \"running out of administrators\". This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed. In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed. But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a crisis. He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. He thought the number of admins did not change much. Wales said earlier that being an admin is \"not a big deal\u201d. He also said that \"It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.\u201d He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003. \nRequests for adminship (RfA).\nThe first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales himself in October 2001. Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be \"akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court\" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, \"It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point\", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was \"prove you weren't a bozo\". Editors can become candidates only after \"extensive work on the wiki\". Any editor can vote in an RfA. The result of the vote is not by the number of votes for or against, but by the consensus that has been reached. The decision if a consensus has been reached can be made only by a bureaucrat. A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a \"request\" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators. This RfA process was started after RfAs attracted a lot of attention. Before the middle of 2005, RfAs did not attract a lot of attention. But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another.\nRole.\nWhen an editor becomes an admin, they are given abilities to perform certain duties. Admins can do messy cleanup work more easily than other editors. They can delete articles. They can also protect pages, which means they can restrict editing rights to that page. Admins can block the accounts of disruptive users. When an admin blocks a user they must do so according to Wikipedia's policies. One of the policies is that a reason must be given for the block. The reason for the block is permanently logged by the software. Admins are not supposed to block other editors just to have an advantage against the blocked editor when the admin is doing editing work.\nScientific studies.\nA scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007 to find out which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's \"Guide to requests for adminship\" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin. In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could \"classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates.\""}

In 2013, he was signed to Ultra Music and Sony Entertainment. \nCareer.\nErix was raised on Long Island, New York. He began performing professionally as a DJ/Emcee at age nine and signed his first management and recording contract as a pop singer at the age of 14 with Louis J. Pearlman, the boyband mogul behind Orlando based Transcontinental Records. Pearlman was later arrested for embezzling 300 million dollars in one of the largest ponzi schemes in US history and also stood accused of molesting several members of the famous groups he managed. \nAfter Pearlman's downfall, Erix signed a record deal with I.D Music in Denmark and Warner/Chappell Music Scandinavia. His early musical efforts with that label found popularity on MySpace which led to an online TV series with the social network called Journey Of A Rock Star. Songs from his album \"For Conformity\" amassed millions of online streams and received airplay on international media networks such as MTV Japan and MNET South Africa before landing Ian's single, \"Confessions Of A Killer\" in the top 10 in Asia.\nIn 2010, Erix entered into a deal with Universal Music Group in Germany but his album release was held up for years when the record company began restructuring and his former A&amp;R and manager, Nik Hafemann, left the label to become a judge on a German reality TV series. During this time, Erix continued to cultivate his presence online and released demo versions of new songs he had been working on such as \"Squeaky Clean\", a pop-punk satire of Disney Channel stars, as well as \"So Scene, So See Through (A Song For Mutts)\" which ultimately inspired the name of Erix's fandom and social justice movement, the \"Mutt Army\". Amidst it's online popularity, Ian was invited to perform the song on MTV UK in a special live session that was recorded for the network in their London studio. Another single from that period, \"The Human Race\" was featured in Season 3 Episode 19 of the popular TV show 90210 on The CW network in the USA and worldwide on Netflix.\nIn 2012, Erix begain to appear as a performer and television presenter in numerous countries around the globe at festivals such as Tomorrowland in Belgium and Ultra Music Festival Europe. He began experimenting with more electronic, dance, and pop sounds and had a major breakthrough in 2012 when he played his single, \"Sex, Dance and Rock &amp; Roll (Lose It)\" onstage at R\u00e9veillon, a live New Year's Eve concert in Brazil with David Guetta that had an in-person audience of 2+ million people. Ian was later signed to Ultra Music and since that time he has continued to tour extensively, visiting over 60 countries worldwide. \nIn 2014, Ian recorded \"Shangri-la\" (also known as \"Rannalle\"), a song he wrote with Finnish boy band TCT and producer Erik Nyholm. The Scandinavian version of the song was nominated for the biggest hit of summer 2014 by radio station The Voice.

Specifically, they do not include any harmony or melody parts. They are neither (i) traditional song backing tracks, which include harmonic accompaniment, nor (ii) traditional rhythm tracks, which are not arranged for a song.\nUses.\nMusicians, including singers, use these tracks to support both their practice and performance of popular song. Typical musical genres represented are pop, blues, jazz, folk and Latin, but any genre may be included that uses a constant pulse. The tracks provide higher-quality rhythmic backing due to being arranged for the song the musician plays. This has advantages over traditional (none song-arranged) rhythm tracks because the musical form of the song is followed by the rhythm.\nComparisons in use.\nFull song backing tracks provide a fuller arrangement of a song than song rhythm tracks do but they may be limited in the facilities to re-arrange / re-mix the backing track. For instance, there might be instruments included that the musicians wish to remove from the mix. Song Rhythm Tracks can be used as the basis for an arrangement generally without requirements of re-arranging the song rhythm tracks. Full song backing tracks are often used by singers as their sole accompaniment. Song rhythm tracks are used by single, or groups of, musicians that do not have a drummer.\nAs rhythmic backing does not include harmony, song rhythm tracks are simpler arrangements than full song backing and are arranged to the musical sectional and chorus structure of the song. These arrangements may be comparable to a drummer's accompaniment and can be used as the rhythm tracks in productions without additional arranging."}

Passers-by and nearby residents also joined in, helping to clear the rubble and pull out survivors. SAF medical officers and MOH doctors present took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble to try and provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving glucose and saline drips to them. At first, power saws and drills were used to cut through the rubble and reach survivors; however the use of heavy machinery posed a risk to people trapped under the rubble. \nThis led to concern among tunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the Mass Rapid Transit, which included Thomas Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Patrick Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, and Michael Scott; as well as Tan Jin Thong, Deputy Director (Operations) SFS.\nThey volunteered to dig 4 tunnels under the rubble, which resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. They later received the Pingat Gagah Perkasa (Conspicuous Gallantry Medal) for their actions.\nThe investigation found that during the calculation of the building\u2019s structural load, only the LIVE LOAD (weight of people in the building, and additional fixtures and fittings, such as furniture) was factored in. The DEAD LOAD (weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant the building was not designed to support its own weight. It was later discovered that an unqualified draftsman, instead of a professional structural engineer, did the calculations for the building. The owner (which died in the collapse) also requested to use inferior materials in construction, in order to reduce the cost.\nAfter the incident, Singapore\u2019s building safety regulations were updated. Since 1989, all structural designs/calculations must not only be prepared by a Professional Engineer, but also counter-checked by an independent Accredited Checker."}

The paradox goes as follows:Imagine a super-intelligent entity known as Omega, and suppose you are confident in its ability to predict your choices. (Maybe Omega is an alien from a planet that's much more technologically advanced than ours.) You know that Omega has often correctly predicted your choices in the past (and has never made an incorrect prediction about your choices), and you also know that Omega has correctly predicted the choices of other people, many of whom are similar to you, in the particular situation about to be described.There are two boxes: A and B. Box A is see-through and contains $1,000. Box B is opaque, and contains either $0 or $1,000,000. You may take both boxes, or only take box B.Omega decides how much money to put into box B. If Omega believes that you will take both boxes, then he will put $0 in box B. If Omega believes that you will only take box B, then he will put $1,000,000 in box B.Omega makes its prediction, puts the money in box B ($0 or $1,000,000), presents the boxes to you, and flies away. Omega does not tell you its prediction, and you do not see how much money Omega put in box B.What do you do?\nArgument for only choosing box B.\nIf Omega is always right, then Omega would only put $1,000,000 in box B when you choose to take only box B. Since $1,000,000 is more preferable than $1,000, only choosing box B makes the most sense and since Omega is always right, then you should choose box B.\nArgument for choosing both boxes.\nSince Omega has already left, the amount of money in box B won't change based on the decision you make. Regardless of what's in box B, you can always get another $1,000 by walking away by both boxes."}

Major groups included the communist\u00a0BOPA\u00a0(Danish:\u00a0\"Borgerlige Partisaner\", Civil Partisans) and\u00a0Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals.\nIn the postwar period, the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings. Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets, with some morally ambiguous choices.

If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods.

In some places like the Middle East it is common. In other places it is illegal.

The classic example of this is the occurrence of haemophilia (and some other conditions) in the royal families of Europe. The repeated marriages between close relatives increased the chance of recessive genes arriving on both chromosomes of a pair, so causing defects to appear. Of course, pre-scientific societies would not have known this. However, they would have seen the results of continual close marriages, such as the brother-sister matings in the Ancient Egyptian royal lines."}

It was released on 22 September 2017 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. On 6 October 2017, it was released for Steam. The story involves a high school student that joins the school's Literature Club and the way the character interacts with its four female members. At first, it looks like a light anime dating simulator, but it soon becomes a psychological horror game. It is a game that breaks the fourth wall very often.\nThe creator of the game, Dan Salvato, was working on the game for close to two years. Before creating this game, Salvato created modifications, or \"mods\", to \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\". At first, \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" was released on itch.io then released on Steam. The game is free, but if you pay $10, you can receive the downloadable content. The game got more than one million downloads three months after it was released.\nOn June 30, 2021, Team Salvato and Serenity Forge released an expanded version of the original game, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, to Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The expansion was later released to macOS on August 12, 2021.\nGameplay.\n\"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" is a visual novel, so most of the game is the player reading the game's story. Sometimes, the player has to make decisions that change how the story goes.\nThe game has a poetry minigame where the player chooses certain words. These words correspond to a certain girl. If certain words are picked, different parts of the story can be viewed. The game also makes the player view some of the files that the game uses to play.\nThe game has a lot of foreshadowing that tells the player certain things about the story. If the player decodes the character files, there are extra stories unlocked. At certain times special files appear in the game files. Text documents show up about the next scenes.\nPlot.\nThe player's character is invited by his childhood friend, Sayori, to join the Literature Club. He meets the other members of the club. They are Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. The player begins to get involved in the club and getting to know the girls better. Near the end of the first act, Sayori tells the player that she has depression and loves the player. Sayori soon commits suicide by hanging herself. The game shows a lot of glitches and it restarts.\nWhen the player begins a new game, the game is very close to the first run, but Sayori is missing. If Sayori is mentioned, the game glitches and she appears as a mix of all the other characters' appearances. The player gets involved in the club again and gets closer to either Natsuki or Yuri. Unusual events happen, like only being able to choose Monika's options. Yuri soon stabs herself several times and dies, or Natsuki's neck cracks and she dies. The game glitches again and it restarts again.\nWith the new game, only Monika is alive. She tells the player that she knows she is in a game and can change the character files.

These are kanji (the Japanese word for Chinese characters) that were simplified in Japan after World War II. At that time the Japanese government changed the writing system by replacing many ky\u016bjitai (kanji: \u65e7\u5b57\u4f53, kana: \u304d\u3085\u3046\u3058\u305f\u3044, meaning: old character forms) by making simpler characters. These newer characters had the exact same meaning and pronunciations as the older ones, but they could be written with fewer strokes of a pen. For example, the character \u6a02 simplified to \u697d. Some shinjitai characters are also used as simplified Chinese characters. For example, the character \u56fd is used in both Japanese and simplified Chinese. However, most shinjitai look more like traditional Chinese characters (called ky\u016bjitai in Japanese) than even simplified Chinese characters do, and there are also far fewer shinjitai than simplified Chinese characters. While most Japanese words these days use the shinjitai form, there are a few words where writing the ky\u016bjitai form is still common. For example, the word \"dragon\" is usually written using the shinjitai character \u7adc, but writing the ky\u016bjitai character \u9f8d for it is also still quite common. For most kanji, however, the shinjitai form is unchanged from the ky\u016bjitai form."}

The movie was also nominated for the 40th Japan Academy Prize.\nPlot.\nMitsuha is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori located in Hida region. She works as a maiden at the family temple. She begins having dreams, where she is a boy living in Tokyo. She learns that she wrote \"Who are you?\" on a notebook. Taki is a high school boy living in Tokyo. He is also having dreams where he is Mitsuha. He learns that they can switch bodies when they wake up. They begin communicating with each other. Taki leaves notes in Mitsuha's notebook and Mitsuha leaves memos in Taki's phone. They change each other's lives during this time.\nWhen Taki is being Mitsuha, he goes with Mitsuha's grandmother and sister to a shrine far away from town. They leave \"kuchikamizake\" there as an offering to the village god. Mitsuha's note on Taki's phone tells Taki that a comet will pass Japan in the sky. Taki wakes up in his body. He tries to call Mitsuha on his cell phone but it could not reach, before the body switching ends. Taki, and his friends, Miki and Tsukasa, arrive in the region, where they learn that the town was destroyed by a comet and all memos of Mitsuha were erased from Taki's phone. They also learn that five hundred people were listed who used to live there. To reconnect his mind with Mitsuha's, Taki goes to the shrine, drinks her sake bottle and ends up remembering her past.\nTaki wakes up in Mitsuha's body and learns that their dreams will fade away. Mitsuha and her friends plan to help everyone evacuate the town, by hijacking the broadcast station. Taki notices that he is in Mitsuha's body and Mitsuha in Taki's body. They unite at the shrine, but they are at three years apart. When twilight (\"kataware-doki\") occurs, they see each other. They try to write each other's name on their hands, but Mitsuha disappears and twilight ends. Taki no longer remembers Mitsuha, after getting his body back. Before returning to her family, Mitsuha realizes that her memories of Taki faded away, and finds a writing that he wrote \"I love you\" instead of his name. Despite the successful evacuation, the comet falls through Japan and destroys the town, while Taki wakes up in the present day.\nFive years later, Taki has been graduated from university. He researches about the history of the town, and learns that everyone survived after the evacuation, under orders from the mayor and Mitsuha's father. Taki and Mitsuha leave the train station and arrive at the staircase. They see each other and recognize themselves they met before and ask for their names.\nProduction.\nShinkai began writing the script for the movie in 2014. He said that he used one of his other movies, \"Cross Road\" to create the story. The story was inspired by many things. It was inspired by Sh\u016bz\u014d Oshimi's \"Inside Mari\", \"Ranma \u00bd\", a novel from the Heian period called \"Torikaebaya Monogatari\", and a short-story by Greg Egan called \"The Safe-Deposit Box\". Shinkai also said that after the sinking of MV \"Sewol\" in 2014, he wanted to make a story about a disaster.\nItomori is a fictional town, located near Lake Suwa in Nagano. The village shrine area was based on Aogashima Island. Many other places in the movie are real, including Hida City Library.\nThe production of the movie took two years.

The story is about Naren and Pooja, who are very different from each other. \nPlot.\nThe show revolves around Naren Vyas (Akshay Mhatre) and Pooja Goel (Sheen Dass).\nNaren is on the path of spirituality, living as a recluse and cut off from worldly activities. Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas, who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja, on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.\nNaren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's caretaker. They ask Pooja to bring Naren back to the mortal, selfish world. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends, and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania, while Pooja has agreed to marry Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession, and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her, while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.\nSoon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feigns insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.\nOne year later.\nPooja returns to Naren's life as Mrs. Kapoor. Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Mr Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja.\nPooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown Dehradun. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her.\nIt is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.\nNaren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.\nSix months later.\nMayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a red-light area with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.\nNaren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.\nKashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an ashram, Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for drowny results in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.\nNaren's adoptive sister Meghna (Sangeita Chauhan) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.\nAngraj (Sahil Uppal), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.\nAngraj is revealed to be alive and gets plastic surgery, and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren.

After an interesting twist in the plot, Supriya herself kills Angraj.\nThe story ends with Supriya managing Angraj's foundation, Rahul and Surbhi having a baby boy, Anuj's wife Rachel (Sandhya Mehta) marries Rahul's half brother Arjun Vyas (Khushwant Walia), and Pooja gets pregnant with Naren's child."}

Shivakumar, or Shiv as he is popularly known, is a Bangalore born leader and a management thinker.\nHe is currently the Group Executive President, Corporate Strategy at Aditya Birla Group. Previously, Shivakumar was the Chairperson &amp; Chief Executive Officer at PepsiCo Holdings Private Limited, India. Prior to that, Shivakumar was Senior Vice President for Emerging Markets at Nokia Telecommunications.\nEarly life and education.\nShivakumar was born and raised in Bangalore, India. \nHe graduated from IIT, Madras in 1982 and from IIM, Calcutta in 1984. In 2005, he went on to study at The Wharton School.\nCareer.\nPre-Nokia.\nShivakumar started his career as a management trainee in the Consumer Products Division at Hindustan Ciba Geigy before shifting toHindustan Unilever Limited where he spent 19 years in sales, marketing and general management positions. He handled consumer major Hindustan Unilever\u2019s foods business between 1989 and 1997, leading brands like Lipton tea, Tree Top fruit juices and Waffles wafers in the snacks segment, before moving to handle shampoos, feminine hygiene and baby products.\nHe moved to Philips India as chief executive officer of the consumer electronics division in 2003.\nNokia (India and Worldwide).\nShivakumar joined Nokia in 2006 as the managing director, India.\nHe was also instrumental in pushing low-cost mobile devices across rural India; making Nokia a dominant brand in India. During this time, Shivakumar was working with leaders like KV Kamath (former chief of the New Development Bank of BRICS countries) and V Balaraman (ex-CEO, Ponds) who were part of the Nokia Advisory Board. With regards to Shivakumar\u2019s success in driving Nokia\u2019s rural market penetration, V Balaraman had this to say:\n\"He opened up the Indian market to mobile phones using the HUL style of ensuring good distribution, branding and making the product available at various price points for different sets of consumers.\" V Balaraman, ex-CEO, Ponds.\nThe robust supply chain Shivakumar had helped build was tested during the battery crisis of 2007, in which Nokia India had to recall millions of devices due to defective batteries. How the company handled this situation later became a case study covered by the Indian School of Business.\nApart from robust supply chains, Shivakumar also oversaw product innovation at Nokia. Under his management, Nokia India launched a range of services, from Music to Agriculture, under the banner of Nokia Life Tools. The introduction of the phone torch, which was a runaway success as users found it a handy solution in case of power cuts, was also a major milestone during his time.\nDuring his time at Nokia, the brand also built a salience within the Indian households by repeatedly betting big on cricket. The brand started its long-lasting tie-up with the Kolkata Knight Riders, owned by its brand ambassador Shah Rukh Khan. Nokia also sponsored the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 and the 2009 T20 World Cup, under Shivakumar\u2019s management. In fact, Nokia India was one of the few brands willing to bet on Indian cricket and sponsor the first T20 World Cup hosted by South Africa in 2007, in which India defeated Pakistan in the finals.\nShivakumar moved on to become Sr. Vice President, Emerging Markets (India, Middle East, Africa) in 2011, handling a market that accounted for 40% of Nokia\u2019s global business and comprised of around 90 countries.\nShivakumar\u2019s time at Nokia is both praised and criticized. He is credited for driving Nokia\u2019s brand from No. 71 to No. 1 in the country increasing their national market share from 46% to 56% by 2006. But he also saw it dip to 30% by 2011 and, towards the end of his time at Nokia, the brand was facing stiff competition in India from smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung.\nLooking back at his time at Nokia, Shivakumar points out that Nokia fell behind as the mobile market shifted almost overnight from voice to content-driven open operating systems like Android. He acknowledges that while the strategy they pursued at the time delivered, it did not foresee this sudden shift.\nHowever, he believes in the humble, honest, caring and empathetic culture of Nokia and is of the opinion that its brand equity is still intact.\nHis contributions from this time have become case studies at Ivy League institutes like Harvard University and the Indian School of Business.\nIn fact, the Harvard Case Study titled \u2018Emerging Nokia?\u2019 looks at the successful strategies that Nokia adopted globally during Shivakumar\u2019s time as the managing director of the Indian market. It examines how Nokia tapped into the emerging markets like China, India and the MEA while turning its back towards markets like Europe, Japan and the USA. The study looks at Shivakumar and his counterparts Colin Giles (heading the Chinese market) and Chris Braam (heading the MEA market).\nPepsiCo India.\nIn 2013, Shivakumar was appointed as the Chairperson &amp; Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Holdings Private Limited, India where he managed brand portfolios across beverages, snacks and nutrition. He is known for being the key driver for portfolio transformation and depended consumer engagement with flagship brands.\nUpon his appointment, this is what PepsiCo Global Chairperson and CEO Indra Nooyi had this to say:\nShivakumar is one of India\u2019s most respected business leaders. He has a proven ability to take billion-dollar businesses to the next level by maximizing innovation, execution and collaboration.\nUnder his leadership, PepsiCo launched brands like Quaker, Tropicana and Doritos in the Indian market. He was also the Chairman of Nourishco (which was a joint venture between PepsiCo and Tata Global Beverages). He and then Vice President of the nutrition category for PepsiCo India, Deepika Warrier, headed the launch of Quaker Oats+Milk, which had Sachin Tendulkar as the brand ambassador.\nShivakumar was at the helm when PepsiCo announced in 2013 that it was investing INR 33,000 crores in the Indian market to expand production and distribution.\nHe also oversaw the much talked about Pepsi walkout from the Indian Premier League. Pepsi ended its title sponsorship with IPL in 2015, two years before the 5-year contract was set to expire by 2017. This pulling out of the contract was due to the match-fixing scandals that had brought disrepute to the league.\nApart from overseeing India operations, he also managed PepsiCo\u2019s franchise business across Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\nUpon his departure from PepsiCo India, Sanjeev Chadha, chief executive at PepsiCo AMENA (Asia, Middle East and Africa) had this to say:\n\u201cHe has been a key driver for portfolio transformation, helped develop our nutrition business, launching innovations with our Quaker and Tropicana brands and deepened consumer engagement with our flagship brands.\u201d \nAditya Birla Group.\nAs of January 2018, Shivakumar has joined Aditya Birla Group as the Group Executive President, Corporate Strategy &amp; Business Development. In his current role, he reports directly to the Chairman of the Group, Kumara Mangalam Birla.\nHe heads the white cement business and the global textile business from the Group.\nAditya Birla Group is one of the largest Indian conglomerates with businesses spread across telecommunications, cement, chemicals, mining, textiles, financial services, retail and e-commerce, among others, in 36 countries.\nPublic image.\nLeadership style.\nD. Shivakumar is known for his friendly, approachable leadership style. At PepsiCo, he used to alternate between two offices every week to ensure his visibility and accessibility to the people he worked with. One of his offices also merely had a round table, to facilitate teamwork and collaboration.\nAt his time in Nokia too, people who have closely worked with Shivakumar said that one of his biggest contributions was to drive leadership within the organisation.\nChris Weber, EVP Sales And Marketing Nokia said in 2013, \u201cIn addition to what Shiv has done for Nokia externally \u2013 his personal convictions on the importance of leadership have resonated throughout the company.\u201d\n\u201cHe has been the de-facto HR manager and the best channel of communication between the junior most guy on the field to the head of businesses or units,\u201d said Poonam Kaul, Director, Communications, Nokia India.\nManagement thinker.\nShivakumar regularly discusses his thoughts on various topics with relation to management. From pointing out how the post of General Manager had slowly become irrelevant post globalization to what skills a fresh pass-out from an MBA school should possess to what the relationship between the individual leader and the company should be, Shivakumar engages with management theories by publishing articles and blogs.\nHe also shares his knowledge with corporate and college students alike by taking courses and appearing for guest lectures.\nShivakumar has published his thoughts and experiences in a book titled \u2018Reflections\u2019. He is currently working on his second book.\nPersonal life.\nShivakumar is an avid reader who regularly puts out his reading list and book reviews. He looks up to management gurus and leaders like Peter Drucker, Jack Welch, Robert McNamara and Harold Geneen as role models.\nShivakumar is also an avid sports watcher, following both the Manchester United and Barcelona football teams. When it comes to tennis, he is a fan of John McEnroe and Roger Federer.\nShivakumar resides in Mumbai, and is married to Hamsini Shivakumar, a semiotics\u2019 entrepreneur and founder of Leapfrog Strategy Consulting."}

It was created by the organization \"Barcelona is not Catalonia\" (AKA \"Plataforma por la Autonom\u00eda de Barcelona\", \"Movement for an Autonomous Barcelona\") as a satirical response towards the Catalonians separatists. Their main target is to establish up a new region in Spain besides Catalonia with some districts (\"Comarcas\" or \"Comarques\") from the provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona. \nIts nomenclature is a neologism created from the provinces' names: Tarragona and Barcelona, and it would span these areas:\nProponents believes the area somewhat corresponds to the historic County of Barcelona, although its extension is considerably different.\nBackground.\nOn 24th September, 2012; \"Barcelona is not Catalonia\"'s members approved in a constituent assembly their statutes and a political program in order to get their own autonomy as an Autonomous Community within Spain.\nThe expression \"Tabarnia\" was used by the first time in 2015 as a territorial entity that would comprise part of the Catalonian seaside and Barcelona Metropolitan Area as a disagreement towards Catalan Government (\"Generalitat Catalana\"):\nProcess of Independence of Catalonia.\nProponents of Tabarnia demands to segregate themselves from the Catalan separatist movement\u00a0and reclaims the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona\u00a0to constitute themselves as an Autonomous Community within Spain. In the 2015 and 2017 Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly\u00a0C's, PSC and\u00a0PP) received a majority of votes and seats in some of these \"comarques\" (Tarragon\u00e8s, Baix Pened\u00e8s, Garraf and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona, but excluding the most populated Catalan city: Barcelona. \nThey allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain, although in last Catalan election, Tarragona province showed more support for separatism than unionism.\nTrending Topic.\nIn December, 2017 the satirical movement became trending topic in the social networks. Since then, they had been appear in Spanish and international media. According them, \"Tabarnia is a historical region that comprised the ancient County of Barcelona, currently part of Tarragona and Barcelona provinces\".\nReactions.\nThe rise of this movement creates tension among the Catalan separatist movement because of argumental contradiction and geostrategic risk using their same arguments for independence word by word. as a result, the catalan separatists contradicts themselves when they uses the \"unionist\" counter-arguments in order to discredit the Tabarnia movement. The territorial area that Tabarnia would comprise includes geostrategic assets that are fundamental for a viable independent Catalonia. The Port of Barcelona and Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, some of the richest industrial sectors fall in fact inside areas that hold a majority of voters in favor of unionism, though in the city of Barcelona the pro-independence won the election.\nThe fact that Tabarnians are asking to be separated from the Catalonia that wants to be separated from Spain, has been interpreted by some newspapers as a\u00a0reductio ad absurdum\u00a0of the nationalistic logic in a XXI century Europe. Many Tabarnians believe that a sustained international media attention to this movement would defeat the catalan independence project by simply following their own arguments instead of opposing them.\nAn ongoing petition is taking place at Change.org in order to be sent to the Spanish Congress of Deputies to consider the creation of this new autonomous region."}

When they do, you should store the camera in this box every time you are going to film something. This box will have holes, a belt, or a metal rod which you can use for tying it to a person, or screwing it on an object that person wears (usually a helmet).

They are usually part of a fire system based on a water reservoir for the supply of the system and a network of pipes. They are usually activated by detecting the effects of a fire, such as the increase in temperature associated with fire, or the smoke generated by combustion. Sometimes, sprinkler systems can be activated at the same time as the actual alarm at a pull station."}

The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.\nThe events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the most well-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre."}

The San are foraging bushmen, and the Khoi are a pastoral people previously known as the Hottentots. The relationship between the two groups is not very clear. The San are generally smaller than other humans in the area. They also look very different than other groups of people there. As of 2018, between 90.000 and 100.000 San are left. Most of them live in Botswana and Namibia. There are San minorities in South Africa, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nThe San were some of the original (indigenous) inhabitants of Southern Africa. Then the southward Bantu migrations from North and East Africa reached the region 700 years ago. The Bantu populations displaced the Khoi and San to become the predominant inhabitants of Southern Africa.\nThe Khoisan \u201cwas the largest population on Earth at some point\u201d, according to one evolutionary geneticist. The evidence of the Khoisan's original presence in South Africa is the distribution of their languages today. Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates a long period of settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region.\nCharles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in \"The Descent of Man\" in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that \"the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner\".\nIn the 1990s, genomic studies of the world's peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share patterns of polymorphisms that are different from those of all other populations. Because the Y chromosome changes little, this type of DNA test is used to determine when different human subgroups separated from one another. This shows their last common ancestry. The authors of these studies suggest that the San may have been one of the first populations to differentiate from the most recent common ancestor of all living humans, estimated to have lived 60,000 to 90,000 years ago."}

It is practiced today by the San people and by the Rar\u00e1mari (Tarahumara) people of northwest Mexico.\nMany animals on grassland move faster than humans. However, humans have endurance and can jog-trot for long distances. Their loss of hair allows them to sweat easily, and their spears give them a way to kill prey at the end of the hunting. \nA group of about four men start out on a search. Finding a suitable antelope, they move towards it, and the animal runs away. They check the signs, such as broken blades of grass, and follow it more slowly, but persistently. Eventually the animal has to stop to eat grass. Grass has so little nutrient that continual eating during the day is essential for their survival. If the antelope runs off into the far distance, one of the younger men is chosen to run after it while the others jog along behind. The runner comes back to say where the animal has gone. In this way younger members with endurance and older men with experience have their roles in the hunt. Eventually the men catch up while the animal can run no further without digesting grass (which is its 'fuel').\nThere is an alternative explanation as to why the animal eventually stops running, and that relates to its lesser ability to reduce its temperature by sweating, because its coat of fur is so much denser than the human hair covering. This may indeed play a part, but primarily the cause of fatigue is what is called 'metabolic fatigue', such as the shortage of fuel within the muscles.\nThe San people and their hunting methods were presented on television by David Attenborough in the documentary \"The Life of Mammals, Program 10 Food for thought\".

Solving it will make mathematicians understand a lot more about prime numbers. It has applications in cryptography, number theory, and might even be useful in physics.\nMathematicians want to know when a certain function, called the Riemann Zeta function, written \u03b6(s), equals zero. There are many well known values of s where \u03b6(s) is zero. They are the negative even integers. The Riemann Hypothesis says that apart from the negative even integers, \u03b6(s) equals zero only when s is a complex number with real part 1/2 or a negative whole number.\nThe Yang-Mills Equations.\nThe solution to this problem is especially important for physicists, as it has applications in quantum mechanics and particle physics, two very important branches of physics. It will, most likely, have applications in mathematics as well.\nThis problem will be solved if someone proves that a certain set of equations, called the Yang-Mills equations, have solutions with certain properties.\nThe P versus NP problem.\nThis problem is very important to computer science. It will be solved if someone manages to discover whether or not a computer can always find a solution to a problem as fast as it can check if the solution is correct. It has applications in engineering, cryptography, economics, and a bunch of other areas. Solving it would even affect the way that online sales and purchases are done.\nThe Navier-Stokes Equations.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are probably the most important equations in fluid mechanics, which studies liquids and gases. People have been using it to build better cars and airplanes, to learn how the atmosphere and sea works, and many other things. They are much used in engineering, in mathematics, and in sciences.\nThe prize will go to the person who discovers whether there is a solution of the equations that eventually does not make sense (goes to infinity, for example). In other words, can a smoothly flowing fluid eventually become infinitely rough?\nThe Hodge Conjecture.\nThis problem has few known applications outside of mathematics. It will help mathematicians understand a lot more about algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, which are connected to many other areas of mathematics. The problem is difficult to explain using words, as it involves things that are not found in everyday life, like algebraic varieties, homology and other related things.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture.\nThe only Millennium Problem that has been solved, as of 2018. A mathematician named Grigori Perelman found out that it was true.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture states that the sphere is the only 3D object that can be shrunk to a single point, given certain conditions."}

For compound words where the same kanji is used twice in a row, \u3005 is used where the second kanji would be so that it doesn't have to be written again. \nFor example, the word \"tokidoki\", which means \"from time to time\", uses the same kanji for \"time\" twice, but is written as \u6642\u3005 instead of \u6642\u6642 because Japanese would see the second compound as redundant. So \u3005 implies that the second character is the same as the first.\nOther same character compounds include:\nThis is similar to English ligatures, or letters that combine to make a new letter or symbol such as &amp;, which was a combination of the letters that make the Latin word \"et\"."}

Kyrgyzstan is their home country. Most of them are Sunni Muslims.\nWhat does their name mean.\nIt comes from the Turkic word \"kyrk\" which means \"forty\". \"Kyrgyz\" means \"a collection of forty tribes\".\nIt also means \"imperishable\", \"inextinguishable\" and \"immortal\".\nThe hero Manas unified 40 tribes against the Khitans. The History of Yuan (written 1370) says there were 40 women born on a steppe.\nTheir name is also spelt Kirgiz (in China). In Kyrgyz, it is \u041a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437 / \u0642\u0649\u0631\u0639\u0649\u0632.\nWhere are they from.\nThey come from Southern Siberia since at least 201\u00a0BC. They descend from the Yenisei Kyrgyz. The Yenisei Kyrgyz lived in the upper Yenisey River valley, central Siberia. The earliest Kyrgyz were also related to the Sakas (Scythians), Wusun, Dingling, Mongols and Xiongnu.\nHistory.\nThey first appear in Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (109 - 91\u00a0BC, Han dynasty, China). They were called \"Gekun\" (, ) or \"Jiankun\" ().\nDuring the 2nd century the Yenisei Kyrgyz were part of the Xiongnu (Huns), Tiele, Rouran, and Xianbei. Later between the 5 - 10\u00a0c, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were part of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk and Uyghur Khaganates.\nIn 840, the Kyrgyz allied with the Tang dynasty to defeat the Uyghur Khaganate (Mongolia). The Kyrgyz qaghan (king) killed the Uyghur qaghan and rescued Princess Taihe. They moved to Jeti-su and spread south to the Tian Shan mountains and Xinjiang. The Kyrgyz then lived peacefully around Central Asia and Xinjiang, as vassals to the Tang.\nThe \"Tanghuiyao\" (8\u201310\u00a0c) called them \"Tsze-gu\" (Kirgut) and \"Xiajiasi\". According to Tang records Xiajia could mean \"yellow head and red face\". That's what the Uyghurs called the Kyrgyz. Their tamga (tribe symbol) is identical to the modern day Kyrgyz tamga.\nIn the 10 - 12\u00a0c, the Kara-Khanid and then Western Liao invaded the area. In the 13th century the Mongol Empire unified everybody. Genghis Khan's first son Jochi occupied Kyrgyzstan.\nThey were part of the Chagatai Khanate and ruled by other Turkic people. In 1685 the Oirat (Dzungar, Mongolic) ruled them.\nRussia then took over, Modern Kyrgyzstan declared independence in 1991.\nBy the 16th century they lived in Siberia, Xinjiang, Tian Shan, Pamir-Alay, Middle Asia, Urals, Kazakhstan, etc. In China, the term Kyrgyz also refers to the oldest Turkic tribes that lived there (the Tiele and Yeniseian Kyrgyz).\nGenes: they look East Asian.\nGenetic shows that Kyrgyz have mostly East Eurasian. In Tajikstan, East Eurasian ancestry is one half to two-thirds.\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, they were described with \"red hair and green eyes\", while those with dark hair and dark eyes descended from the Chinese.\nThe Kyrgyz were fair-skinned, green- or blue-eyed and red-haired people with East Asian features.\nReligion.\nNowadays Kyrgyz are mostly Muslims of the Hanafi Sunni school.\nBut they were originally shamanist. Arab traders travelled along the Silk Road and arrived by the 8th century. But the Kyrgyz were not immediately converted. The Persian text \"Hudud al-'alam\", said that the Kyrgyz \"venerate the Fire and burn the dead\".\nIslam spread during the Mongol empire and following Chagatai Khanate.\nBy the 18th century the Kyrgyz were converted by the Khanate of Kokand (a vassal of the Qing dynasty).\nSome Kyrgyz-Chinese practice Tibetan Buddhism.\nChinese-Kyrgyz.\nThe Kyrgyz-Chinese are one of the 56 ethnic groups of China. There are more than 145,000 Kyrgyz livinng in China. They are known as \"K\u0113'\u011brk\u00e8z\u012b z\u00fa\" (). They live mainly in Xinjiang.\nIn the 19th century, the Russians conquered Kyrgyz land and drove many to China. The Kyrgyz had a better life in China than in Russia. The Russians fought against the Muslim nomadic Kyrgyz. But because there were so many Chinese-Kyrgyz, the Russians stopped because they did not want to fight against the Chinese. The Muslim Kyrgyz were sure that in any upcoming conflict, China would defeat Russia.\nSome are called the \"Fuyu Kyrgyz\". They are Yenisei Kirghiz (Khakas people) people. In the 17th c, the Dzungar khanate moved them from the Yenisei river to Dzungaria. In the 18th c, the Qing dynasty then defeated Dzungaria and moved them to Manchuria. They now live in Wujiazi Village, Fuyu County, Heilongjiang. Their language is related to the Khakas language (the Fuy\u00fc G\u00efrg\u00efs dialect).\nLanguage.\nThey speak a Turkic language. It used to be written in Turkic old script. In Kyrgyzstan, it is written with the Cyrillic alphabet. In China it is written with an Arabic script. President Atambaev of Kyrgyzstan said switching from Cyrillic to Latin (like Kazakhstan had) may hurt communication with Kyrgyz people in Russia."}

Women are more likely to do this because they are afraid or to defend themselves. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be trying to be in control.

The show Got replaced by a Mythology show Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni.\nPlot summary.\nThe show's unique name has been taken from common Bengali childhood rhyme. It truly captures the free-spirited love and chemistry between the protagonists - Abir and Shaluk. Life takes a turn when introvert city-bred boy 'Abir' meets the vivacious village girl 'Shaluk'. Their unusual friendship clicks in an instant and soon a sweet innocent chemistry develops between the two. Soon they realize their feelings towards each other. Thus, starts the story of their 'first love'. 'Eii Chhele Ta Bhelbhele Ta' is a tale of love, which follows the protagonists through myriad of situations and sees them unite against all odds. The story showcases a pure love story between two teenagers and how their love matures over time and rises above the different obstacles of life.\nThe show however has a lot of exist undertones too. The lead female character Shaluk is characterized as an all virtuous young lady without any faults .The writers and producers of the show, portray female lead characters idealistically instead of celebrating their faults as part of normal human nature. The supporting characters on the other hand are extremely blatant and malleable. They never show any strong or original viewpoints, as if the only reason for their casting is to complete a joint Bengali family. The male lead Abir is a polygamist and also narcissistic. He is a postgraduate student in Physics(it remains to be seen how that is possible because he is really stupid); without any source of income while staying in his parents house and without even trying is able to seduce two women to marry him. This is either because the women married him for the family heirloom or testimony to the dystopian mindset of the writers. "}

He was both President and Prime Minister of Mauritius. He was a Member of Parliament for Piton &amp; Riviere Du Rempart.\nEarly life.\nComing from a family of Indian origin, he was born at the Cave in Vacoas. He studied at La Palma Elementary School and High School at Regent College and New Eton College. A lawyer by training, he worked in 1951 in the Department of Justice. In 1964 he was elected to the municipal council of his village, La Palma.\nPolitical career.\nPrime Minister.\nHe was a member of the Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM), and becomes its president, the secretary general being Paul Berenger. He became prime minister in 1982 following the success of the MMM. But in 1983, dissensions within the party led to a break-up of the MMM and the dissolution of the government in 1983. Twelve of his ministers, including Paul Berenger, resigned from the government. Anerood Jugnauth founded the Socialist Militant Movement (MSM) and built an alliance with the Labor Party of Mauritius on the one hand, and with the Mauritian Social Democrat Party (PMSD), Ga\u00e9tan Duval, on the other. This alliance won the general elections held in 1983 and 1987. A coalition in 1990 with the MMM, sealing the occasional reunion between these two formations, allows him to win the elections of 1991, while the island prepares to abolish the monarchy to become a republic.\nHe remained prime minister until 1995. From 1982 to 1995, during which he led the Mauritian government, Mauritius experienced a profound economic evolution. In particular, from 1984 to 1988, the growth rate is around 7%. These are years of economic boom with the creation of a local industry. He had as Minister of Economy and Finance, successively in his various governments, Paul Berenger and Vishnu Lutchmeenaraidoo and Rama Sithanen.\nHe was Prime Minister after the elections of September 2000, then after 3 years, as agreed, ceded his position to his ally of the militant Movement Mauritian, Paul Berenger. \nPresidency.\nIn October 2003, he became President of the Republic. In this republic born in 1992, the president has no decision-making power: his role is the symbolic representation of Mauritius abroad. The holder of the executive power is therefore the Prime Minister, a position he held for 12 years. He resigned from the presidency in March 2012.\nIn 2007, he threatened to leave the Commonwealth to protest the UK's treatment of Chagos residents. He said he could take the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice over the fate of the islanders. The Chagos Islands, a British colony in the Indian Ocean, were leased to the United States in the 1960s to build a military base. The inhabitants were driven out and the government says they can not come back, but have obtained British citizenship. Most people live in poverty in Mauritius, or as refugees in the UK. The American base was built on the large island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago. Mauritius claims the islands as part of its territory, and he claimed that his country was forced by the British to accept the Chagossians as a condition for independence.\nOn March 30, 2012, he announced his resignation, which took effect the next day, because of his disagreement with the members of the government.\nReturn as Prime Minister.\nHe won the parliamentary elections in December 2014.\nOn January 21, 2017, he announced his resignation in a televised speech. On January 23, 2017, he is replaced by the Minister of Finance, his son, Pravind Jugnauth.\nDeath.\nJugnauth died in Flor\u00e9al, Mauritius on 3 June 2021, aged 91."}

In the later years of Qajar rule, the house served as the British General Consulate in Isfahan. Now, after a three-year restoration, it is the central headquarters of Polsheer Associates. Brick, tile, glass and canvas were all used in the restoration.\nSummary.\nProject Title: Polsheer House\nDate of Completion: June 2001\nLocation: Djolfa, Isfahan, Iran\nSize: 711 square metres\nCost: US$100,000\nClient: Dr Mohammead Reza Ghanei\nHeritage Architect: Polsheer Architects Co\nContractor: Polsheer Architects Co\nUNESCO Award.\nPolsheer House received \"UNESCO Award of Merit\" in 2002 \nJury Citation.\nThe restoration of the 300-year-old traditional Iranian courtyard house demonstrates an exemplary conservation approach by remaining faithful to the original building. The project adhered to all aspects of best conservation practice, with the result that the existing historic building fabric is scrupulously maintained while the exquisite jewel-like interiors are restored to their original vibrancy. By choosing to adapt an old building for modern use, the project team is to be highly commended as their efforts set a technical benchmark for conservation and give momentum to private-sector conservation in Iran.\nProject Synopsis.\nThe 300-year-old House of Zovelian, registered on the Iranian Cultural Heritage list, was purchased by Polsheer Architects, Planners and Engineers in the late 1990s and renamed Polsheer house. Located in the Tabriziha neighbourhood in the ancient town of Isfahan, Polsheer House, with its distinctive spatial arrangement, elaborate decorative motifs and intricate details, is one of the most valuable examples of Iranian historic residential architecture.\nAt the time of purchase, due to age and neglect, the , courtyard building was in a state of decay. Much of the structure was in need of stabilization and repair as evidenced by the structural cracks in the walls and ceilings. Also, a number of inappropriate additions had been made to the structure over its history, diminishing its aesthetic and heritage value. Furthermore, the prominent and character-defining elements of the house, namely the decorative frescoes and other artworks, were faded or covered with grease and dirt.\nThe Polsheer company planned to \u2018breathe new life into an old context\u2019 by restoring the old residential building into a working space and transform a private space into a public domain. The main focus was on repair of the existing fabric and the integration of contemporary services within the elegant but delicate structure. The project took about three years to complete, although maintenance and upgrades will be ongoing.\nHighlights of Conservation Approach.\nCommencing in 1998, the conservation process involved the following works: elimination of inappropriate additions, strengthening of the building\u2019s structure, repair of cracks in surfaces, control and elimination of destructive factors such as rising damp, restoration of frescoes and decorative details and the sensitive incorporation of modern services and facilities such as water and sewage systems.\nIn order to stabilize the structure and prevent further cracks, the building\u2019s heavy mud roof coating was removed and steel reinforcements were inserted into the structure. The roof was then recoated with the traditional materials of mud and straw. Once this cause of instability and damage had been removed, the cracks of the walls and ceilings were repaired. Rising damp, which has been detrimental to the building\u2019s fabric was rectified with the creation of channels around the house which would direct water away from the walls and foundations.\nAn important task was to restore the original layout of the building and replace inappropriate materials with traditional matter. For example, the concrete courtyard tiles were replaced with traditional bricks.\nExperts of the Cultural Heritage Organization were invited to assist in the cleaning of the buildings decorative motifs and over a period of two years the wall paintings were restored to their former glory. In areas where frescoes or motifs had been plastered-over, the plaster layers were removed and the decorative artwork recovered.\nConservation and the Community.\nAccomplished and financed entirely by Polsheer alone, the project has received praise from academics and from both local and foreign architects. Moreover, there is no doubt the restoration of the Polsheer house has revitalized the streetscape and is the first step in raising awareness in the community of the heritage value of historic buildings and their viability for modern uses."}

She was a member of the Latter Day Saint Church. She lived with Joseph Smith and his family in Nauvoo, Illinois. She traveled with her husband to Utah, spending the winter of 1846\u20131847 at Winter Quarters. Winter Quarters was a camp where members of the church stayed during the winter. James asked the church leaders to be endowed and sealed. Endowment and sealing are special Mormon rituals for really good members. James was good enough for the rituals, but because she was black, church leaders said that she could not have the endowment. James kept asking, even though they said no. James was adopted as a servant into the Joseph Smith family through a specially created temple ceremony. After her death, she was endowed through another person in 1979.\nConversion and relocation to Nauvoo.\nIn 1842, two LDS missionaries were preaching in the Wilton, Connecticut area. One of the missionaries was Charles Wesley Wandell. Ms. James' Presbyterian preacher told her that she could not meet with the missionaries. But she still wanted to listen to them. She wrote, \"I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel.\" James believed what they said. On the next Sunday, she was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She later met many friends with her new beliefs. James and her family wanted to live near other members of their new faith. So, a year later, James and eight other members of her family moved from Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois. It was her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law that moved with her. Wandell helped the group of nine and some other Latter-Day Saints start their journey. But their group had to stay in Buffalo, New York, because they could not pay the ticket price of the train going to Ohio. To get to Ohio, James and her family walked about 800 miles (1287\u00a0km). In a book that was written about her life in 1893, James talked about their journey. She said that their shoes broke, their feet hurt and started to bleed. She said, \"We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground.\" James and her family were welcomed to Nauvoo by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Over the next year, her family was able to build their own homes. But James lived with Joseph Smith's family in Nauvoo until Smith's death in 1844."}

It is a book about law, comparing different ideas. The Books published by Montesquieu were subject to censorship. For this reason, the book was published anonymously, at first. The work was rapidly translated to other languages. In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation. In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added \"De l'esprit des lois\" to its \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (\"List of Prohibited Books\"). Yet Montesquieu's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others, most notably: Catherine the Great, who produced \"Nakaz\" (\"Instruction\"); the Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution; and Alexis de Tocqueville, who applied Montesquieu's methods to a study of American society, in \"Democracy in America\". Macaulay offers us a hint of Montesquieu's importance when he writes in his 1827 essay entitled \"Machiavelli\" that \"Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe.\"\nMontesquieu spent around twenty one years researching and writing \"De l'esprit des lois\", covering many topics including law, social life and the study of anthropology, and providing more than 3,000 commendations. In this treatise Montesquieu argued that political institutions needed, for their success, to reflect the social and geographical aspects of the particular community. He pleaded for a constitutional system of government with separation of powers, the preservation of legality and civil liberties, and the end of slavery."}

{"id": "617177", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617177", "title": "Oxalaia", "text": "Oxalaia was a large predatory dinosaur. It lived during the Upper Cretaceous of what is now Brazil, sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. \"Oxalaia\" is known only from two bones of the skull, which were discovered in 1999. The animal was named in 2011 by a group of Brazilian palaeontologists.\nIt was a member of the Spinosauridae family, a group of crocodile-like theropod dinosaurs. Like other spinosaurids, \"Oxalaia\" had a long nose or snout with jaws and teeth shaped to feed on fish. \"Oxalaia\"'s habitat was tropical, an area of large forests around which were dry deserts. \"Oxalaia\" shared this environment with many other animals, most of which are also known from other Cretaceous fossils discovered in Africa.\nDiscovery and naming.\nIn 1999, two fossil bones of \"Oxalaia\" were found in rocks on an island in the Northeast Region of Brazil. This part of the island gets covered up by the sea at high tide. Because of the action of the waves which cause erosion, the fossils were almost lost. Hundreds of other fossil teeth were also found at the same place.\nThe full name of the dinosaur is \"Oxalaia quilombensis\". The animal was named by Brazilian palaeontologists Alexander Kellner, Elaine Machado, Sergio Azevedo, Deise Henriques, and Luciana Carvalho. The first part of the dinosaur's name (the genus) comes from an African god. The second part of the name (the species) comes from the \"quilombos\", a group of Brazilian towns.\nIn 2011 the discovery of \"Oxalaia\" was presented at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. Machado said that people are interested in spinosaurids: because of how different they are from other carnivorous dinosaurs, and because they are known by the public through the \"Jurassic Park\" movies.\nOnly two pieces of bone are known from \"Oxalaia.\" The first is the tip of its snout, called the premaxilla bone. The second is a piece of its left maxilla, or main upper jaw bone. The two pieces were put on display in the National Museum of Brazil in 2011. The museum was burnt down in a large fire in 2018, and the \"Oxalaia\" fossils may have been destroyed.\n\"Oxalaia\" is the third spinosaurid named from Brazil so far. The other two are \"Irritator\" and \"Angaturama\" (which might be the same animal as \"Irritator\"). These two animals are known from another part of Brazil, and lived nine to six million years before \"Oxalaia\".\nDescription.\nTo estimate its size, \"Oxalaia\"'s skull bones were compared with those of its close relative, \"Spinosaurus\". \"Oxalaia\" was probably long, and likely weighed . This makes it the largest known carnivorous dinosaur from Brazil.\nThe tip of \"Oxalaia\"'s snout, called the premaxilla, was long. \"Oxalaia\"'s complete skull was probably long. This is shorter than the skull of \"Spinosaurus,\" which was long\".\"\nThe front of \"Oxalaia\"'s upper jaw was spoon-shaped, or larger at its front end than at its rear end. The bottom of the snout tip was curved inwards. This shape would have joined with the lower jaw, or mandible, which was also spoon-shaped. The roof of \"Oxalaia\"'s mouth had a very complex and bony surface, called a secondary palate. This structure made the upper jaw more sturdy, so it would bend less when feeding. The fossil snout preserves broad and deep holes. These probably contained blood vessels and nerves.\nThe snout of \"Oxalaia\" had seven tooth sockets on each side. It had one tooth in each socket, and there were two teeth underneath to replace it if it fell out. This feature is common in sharks, but not in most theropod dinosaurs. \"Oxalaia\"'s teeth were also oval in cross section, instead of flattened somewhat sideways like in most theropods.\nClassification.\n\"Oxalaia\" is more closely related to the African than Brazilian members of its family. \"Oxalaia\", \"Irritator\", \"Angaturama\", \"Ichthyovenator\", and \"Spinosaurus\" are the only known dinosaurs from their clade that don't have knife-like (or serrated) teeth. This places them in their own subfamily, called the Spinosaurinae\".\"\n\"Oxalaia\" can be separated from \"Spinosaurus\" by differences between their jaw bones\".\" For example: \"Oxalaia\" had a rounder snout, and more closely spaced teeth than \"Spinosaurus\". \"Oxalaia\"'s two replacement teeth per socket, and less smooth secondary palate, also make it unique among the other known spinosaurs.\nThe cladogram below shows \"Oxalaia\"'s relationship with other spinosaurids. It is from a study by Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz:\nPalaeobiology.\nDiet and feeding.\nSpinosaurids likely spent most of their time near or in water, feeding mostly on aquatic animals like fish. This way, they would avoid competing with other large predatory dinosaurs. Fossil evidence shows that spinosaurs sometimes also ate pterosaurs and small dinosaurs. \nThe cone-shaped teeth of \"Oxalaia\" were built for impaling prey, instead of cutting flesh like those of most theropod dinosaurs. \"Oxalaia\"'s nostrils were placed far back on the head. This was probably to avoid water getting inside its nostrils when fishing. Both of these features were unique to spinosaurid dinosaurs, and were useful for catching and feeding on fish. The spoon-shaped front jaws and piercing teeth of spinosaurs worked as an efficient fish trap. This trait is also seen in the Indian gharial\u2014the most fish-eating of modern crocodilians.\nHabitat.\n\"Oxalaia\" is known from the Alc\u00e2ntara Formation, a geological formation in northeastern Brazil. This formation dates to the Upper Cretaceous Period, sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Back then, the environment of the formation had a wet climate. There were large tropical forests made of plants like conifer trees, ferns, and horsetails. These forests were surrounded by an arid, or dry, landscape.\n\"Oxalaia\" shared this habitat with many different kinds of animals. Other dinosaurs found in the formation included giant carnivores like \"Carcharodontosaurus\", and perhaps \"Spinosaurus\". Smaller predators lived there too, such as dromaeosaurids, and an animal very similar to \"Masiakasaurus\". There were also large sauropods, a group of herbivorous (plant-eating) dinosaurs. Fish found in the formation included bony fish, ray-finned fish, and lungfish. There were also giant coelacanths and sawfishes. Besides dinosaurs, there were other reptiles, like pterosaurs and crocodilians. Fossils of snakes and molluscs have also been found.\nThe fauna from the Upper Cretaceous of Brazil is very similar to that of Morocco and Egypt during the same time period. This is because South America and Africa used to be connected, in a giant supercontinent called Gondwana."}

It was from the Early Cretaceous, about 113 to 125 million years ago. Its fossils were found in Laos in 2010. \"Ichthyovenator\" was a spinosaurid, they were crocodile-like dinosaurs that ate fish.\nIt is one of three spinosaurids found in Asia, the other two are Siamosaurus, and \"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe first parts of the skeleton were found in 2010. They include: One rib, part of the animal's backbones (or vertebra), and most hip bones. They did not find the skull.\nThe only known species is \"Ichthyovenator laosensis.\" It was named and described by Ronan Allain and his colleagues in 2012. It was found in the Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation.\nThe name \"Ichthyovenator\" comes from the Greek word for \"fish\" and the Latin word for \"hunter\", The name refers to the fact that it ate fish. The species name is \"laosensis\", because it lived in what is now Laos.\nWhile \"Ichthyovenator\" was being described, paleontologists were still digging up more of its bones.\nRonan Allain was one of \"Ichthyovenator's\" original describers. In 2014, he mentioned that more of \"Icthyovenator's\" skeleton was dug up in 2012. He wrote this in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. These new bones include: several teeth, a hip bone, most neck bones, and a few back and tail bones. The description of the new bones has not been officially published.\nIn 2015, some of \"Ichthyovenator's\" bones were compared to the ones of \"Sigilmassasaurus. Sigilmassasaurus\" is another spinosaurid.\nDescription.\nPaleontologists estimate \"Ichthyovenator\" was about long. That's about as big as Baryonyx, one of its close relatives.\nIt had a half-meter sail or hump on its back, similar to \"Suchomimus\", or \"Spinosaurus\". Ichthyovenator's sail was unusual because it was split in two at the hips. Scientists don't know why it was like that.\nClassification.\n\"Ichthyovenator\" was first classified as a spinosaurid, inside the subfamily baryonychinae. This is the same subfamily that includes \"Baryonyx\" and \"Suchomimus\".\nIn 2014 it was found that \"Ichthyovenator\" was part of the subfamily spinosaurinae instead. This was because of specific features on its teeth, and because its backbones look much like the ones of \"Sigilmassasaurus\".\nSome sources say \"Ichthyovenator\" might not have been a spinosaurid. They say it may have been a sail-backed carcharodontosaurid, and that it was related to \"Concavenator\". But this hypothesis has not been published in an academic place.\nThe diagram below is called a cladogram. It shows how \"Ichthyovenator\" is related to other dinosaurs in its family tree. This cladogram is by Allain \"et al.\" (2012):"}

It's at the corner of West Yangchang and Zhidan Roads.\nHistory.\nRen Renfa and his workers built the water gate on the Wusong River around 1300 during the Yuan Dynasty. Today, Suzhou Creek is small and less important than the Huangpu River, but it used to be bigger and more important for all the cities between Suzhou and the East China Sea. Dirt and sand in the river (\"silt\") slowly made it narrower and narrower. People built the water gate to help stop and wash away some of the dirt. The river changed its path to the south, the old gate became covered with dirt, and people forgot where it was.\nWorkers found the water gate in May 2001 while they were building new apartment buildings in the area. Once they understood that the stone their machines hit was a very old building, archaeologists came to look at it. The archaeologists started digging in January 2004 and finished in May 2006.\nWorkers started building the museum in November 2009 and finished on December 31st, 2012."}

Semiotics is the study of how we attach meaning to the world around us and how we communicate that meaning to others. \nRelevant Historical Events.\n1857- Saussure was born in Geneva, Switzerland.\n1870s- Saussure studied Sanskrit, Latin and Ancient Greek at the University of Geneva.\n1876-1880- Saussure studies historical linguistics in the German cities of Leipzig and Berlin.\n1880- Saussure received his doctorate in Leipzig. He moved to Paris to become a professor in historical linguistics.\n1891- Saussure accepted the title of \u201cChevalier of the Legion of Honor\u201d after teaching for 11 years in Paris, at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes. He returned to Geneva, accepting a job as a professor.\n1907-1911- For three years in a row, Saussure holds a lecture series about general linguistics.\n1913- Saussure dies.\n1916- Saussure\u2019s students put together notes from the lectures and publish them in a book called \"Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" or \"Course on General Linguistics\"\nSaussure was a professor in historical linguistics, which is concerned with how languages relate to each other and how they change over time. This interest in how language changes over time can be called diachrony. Saussure was more interested in synchrony, which doesn\u2019t change over time. This means he looked at the parts of a language, as if they didn\u2019t change. Saussure studied the structure of language without comparing it to other languages and without focusing on change. \nSaussure distinguished two different parts of language, \"langue\" and \"parole\". \"Langue\" is the system of the language or the theory of the language. When we learn a language in school we are learning the \u201clangue\u201d of the language: vocabulary words, grammatical structures, the order of words, etc. \"Parole\" is how the language is actually spoken. Often times, people speak in a way that is different from how language is taught in schools. We make mistakes, use slang words, and use figurative language. This is all part of parole. Saussure was more interested in studying the langue of a language. Parole was harder to study because the language people speak changes often. Studying the langue allowed Saussure to understand the basic structure of language. \nSaussure wanted to know how people communicate language with each other. In his \u201cCourse in General Linguistics\u201d, Saussure first defines language and how it is involved in speech. \nDefining Language.\nMany different factors work together to create language. \nTo summarize, Saussure describes language as our ability to represent meaning by using signs (the words themselves and the way they sound when spoken). In the process of communicating with another individual, language can be found in the process of taking meaning from the words that we hear (which make up an \u201cauditory image\u201d). This process is psychological, while producing signs is the physiological process of speech. To study language, we focus on the psychological process.\nLanguage is studied apart from speech. It does not exist among one person but among the community of people that use it. Each member of the community shares a knowledge of the language but cannot change the system of the language individually. Language as a stable system can be studied scientifically, which is the goal of linguistics. \nSaussure also focuses on the arbitrary nature of signs.This means that a word and the sounds that make up a word don\u2019t tell us anything about word means. For example, the word \u201cdog\u201d doesn\u2019t tell us about what a dog is. The letters and sounds chosen are not special.\u00a0 Most words are chosen in this way. A small amount of words are not. For example in the word \u201cslap\u201d, the letters sound like the noise you hear when you slap something. The arbitrary nature of sounds allows us to make many words. If every letter had a single meaning, then we could only create a small number of words with that letter."}

They are unique among other meat-eating dinosaurs from their more water-based lifestyle, which involved a diet of mostly fish. Spinosaurid fossils have been found all over the world, including Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia.\nDescription.\nSpinosaurids had longer arms than most theropods, the claw on the first finger was usually the largest. They evolved jaws like those of crocodiles, and their teeth were long and cone-shaped, made to trap prey in their mouths instead of tearing them apart. Because of this, their teeth usually did not have the strong knife-like edges (called serrations) of a lot of other meat-eating dinosaurs.\nThe family contains Spinosaurus, the first spinosaurid discovered, and the largest carnivorous dinosaur we know of. Paleontologists suggest it might have reached up to 15 meters (49\u00a0ft.) in length.\nPaleobiology.\nA study made in 2010 by Roman Amiot and his colleagues found that spinosaurids had very semiaquatic (living partly in water, and partly on land) lifestyles, this means they lived in habitats like those of hippopotamuses, crocodiles, and turtles, making them very unusual compared to other theropods. It also means they could exist at the same time and place as other large predators without competing for food. For example; Carcharodontosaurus, which lived at the same time as Sigilmassasaurus and Spinosaurus, did not need to fight with either of those animals for prey; those spinosaurids ate fish, while Carcharodontosaurus was on land most of the time, hunting smaller dinosaurs.\nClassification.\nThe family \"Spinosauridae\" was named by the German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915, he was the one that discovered the first genus in the group, \"Spinosaurus\". And as scientists discovered more fossils of its close relatives, the family was eventually split into two subfamilies: Baryonychinae, and Spinosaurinae. This was done because of differences in the anatomy of their skulls and teeth.\nThis is a cladogram made in 2017 showing the relationships between different spinosaurids inside of megalosauroidea."}

Another objective was to expand the base and destroy some of the French garrison force, experimenting with tactics for the People's Army of Vietnam at that time with little experience in combat.\nIn 1949 the French Army was still unable to advance into the Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc area. The control of the Northern Delta was slow but unstable. Vi\u1ec7t Minh gradually reorganized its apparatus and forces, and began organizing large-scale battles against French forces.During the five years of the war against the French in isolation, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh actively expanded relations to seek international support. On October 1 1949 the People's Republic of China was established and quickly recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The prestige and military capabilities of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh Front are growing in the people.\nDuring the same five years, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh also adopted overseas Vietnamese organizations in France and left-leaning organizations to fight politics strongly influencing the French people's rising resistance to Indochina War. France fell into an unprecedented political crisis. The Vietnamese State lacked credibility among the people as a puppet government, and its army was too weak to cooperate with French troops in Indochina to win the war. The French government was forced to take into account the US government's plan to accept economic and military aid to pursue the war.\nHowever, after five years of war French troops in Indochina became more and more bogged down in defense. In addition, although the development of the native force, but the quality and the fighting spirit is low it is almost impossible to undertake military tasks instead of the French."}

Two years later in 1824, Georges Cuvier mentioned them in the first interpretation of a spinosaurid fossil. But at the time, paleontologists didn't know about the crocodile-like teeth of spinosaurids\nIn 1897 the second species \"Suchosaurus girardi\" was named, after two pieces of its jaw and one tooth were found in Portugal.\nDuring the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, scientists thought that \"Suchosaurus\" was probably some kind of obscure Crocodilian. But in 1998, paleontologist Angela Milner was publishing a new description of \"Baryonyx\", and she realized that the teeth of that spinosaurid dinosaur were extremely similar to those from \"Suchosaurus\". Later in 2003, she suggested that they could be the same animal. \"Suchosaurus\" teeth are also very close to the ones from \"Cristatusaurus\" and \"Suchomimus\", all this means it has the general features of a member from the family Baryonychinae."}

He lived there until he was ten years old then moved to New York City. In New York he surrounded himself with German friends and family and even continued to speak Viennese at home. For the rest of his life he felt like a member of both American and German-Austrian cultures. He studied Latin, Greek, philosophy, and science at the City College of New York until he graduated in 1901. Then he worked as a teacher in New York City public schools for three years. In 1904 he started to go to Columbia University for graduate school and it was there that he met Franz Boas, a famous anthropologist. Boas became Lowie's teacher and role model. Lowie liked Boas because of their shared German background and similar interest in details rather than abstractions about human cultures. As a student of Boas, Lowie was tasked with writing a thesis about the Native American Crow tribe, which is what ended up sparking his interest in other tribes. He graduated from Columbia with his Ph.D in 1908 and worked at the Natural History Museum in New York City from then until 1921. He enjoyed researching and writing, so he continued to do those things throughout his life. He did extensive ethnographic field work during this time and studied more than nine Native American tribes throughout his lifetime. He was a teacher at UC Berkeley from 1921 to 1950.\nEmphasis on Individual Variation.\nOne of Boas's main interests and most passionate arguments was that of individual variation. As Stefan Bargheer writes, \"the notion of individual variability in the work of Lowie [\u2026started] in the 1910s [\u2026]. Lowie's argument was initially directed against race scholars [\u2026] who argued that the Nordic race displayed a higher range of variation than other races and could thus be assumed to produce a particularly high number of exceptional individuals, which ensured the superiority of the culture produced by this race.\" Instead he argued that there really were no differences in the range of variation between races. \nCritique of Race and Racism.\nAlthough the popular belief in the early 20th century was that the white race was better than all others, Lowie argued against racism, saying that all races had individual variation present within them and that no one race was superior. He used statistics to argue that \"the differences in cultural achievements between groups was a function of their population size and thus of the total number of outstanding individuals-not of the rate at which such individuals occurred.\"\nHe realized that because bigger populations have more people they are more likely to have a higher number of very smart individuals. He also applied his beliefs to primitive societies, arguing that they too had individual variation. In Primitive Society (1920) he argues \"that mental processes are not only comparable but identical in the simpler and the higher civilizations.\" His interests were always primarily in culture and psychology. He specifically studied issues in race, environment, nature, and relationships. He believed that people were different, but he did not believe that one race was superior to others even though this belief was common during WWII when he was alive.\nHe fought for German scientists during the war, and against scientific racism, which is when scientific evidence is used to try to justify the discrimination against certain peoples. He also argued against the belief that cultures create people with identical personalities, spread by his two peers Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Mead and Benedict thought people within the same culture had very similar personality traits and that at least primitive cultures were more or less invariant.\nFamous Books.\nHis most famous books are Primitive Society (1920), Culture and Ethnology (1917), History of Ethnological Theory (1937), Primitive Religion (1924), Are We Civilized (1929), Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (1934), The German People (1945), and Toward Understanding Germany (1954). He even contributed 33 papers to Selected Papers in Anthropology (1960) between the years 1911 and 1957."}

When other scientists tried to clone monkeys before this, they used donated embryonic stem cells, but Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua came from donated nuclei from fetal cells, which is harder to do. The two baby monkeys were both born at the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.\nBackground.\nScientists made the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, in 1996 using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Since then, scientists have cloned 23 different kinds of mammals, including cows, cats, dogs, horses, and rats. But primates have been very hard to clone. Reprogramming nuclei that have been moved from one cell to another is very difficult. A monkey named Tetra (born October 1999), a female rhesus macaque, was made by a team led by Gerald Schatten of the Oregon National Primate Research Center using a different technique, called \"embryo splitting,\" which is a way of making an artificial twin. Embryo splitting is not as hard as somatic cell nuclear transfer, and it can only be done from an embryo. So some people say Tetra is the first cloned primate and other people say Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are.\nIn January 2019, scientists in China said they had made five identical cloned gene-edited monkeys using somatic cell nuclear transfer, like with Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua. They also used a gene-editing Crispr-Cas9 technique that He Jiankui said was used to create the first gene-modified human babies Lulu and Nana. These monkey clones were made to study several medical diseases.\nProcess.\nZhong Zhong and Hua Hua were made by scientists from the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. Team leaders were Qiang Sun and Muming Poo. They took nuclei from fiber cells of a fetal crab-eating macaque monkey or \"Macaca fascicularis\"). A fetus is an animal that has grown bigger than an embryo but has not been born or hatched yet. They removed the nuclei from egg cells (ova) and then put the nuclei from the fetal cells into these ova. The team used two enzymes to change the epigenetic memory of the donated nuclei so they would act like embryonic nuclei. They then put 21 of these ova with donated nuclei into surrogate mother monkeys. There were six pregnancies, and finally two living animals. These monkeys were named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, after \"Zhonghua\" (, a Chinese name for China). Although this was still not many baby monkeys born, scientists think methods could become better in the future. The Scotland-based team that created Dolly the sheep in 1996 needed to try 277 times and produced only one baby sheep.\nThe older the donated nucleus is, the harder it is to make a clone. Fetal cells are harder to clone than embryonic cells, and adult cells are harder than fetal cells. The same team of scientists also tried to clone macaques using nuclei from adult monkeys, but it did not work. They implanted 42 mother monkeys, and 22 of them became pregnant, but there were only two infant macaques, and they died soon after birth.\nOther ideas.\nMuming Poo said the birth of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua does show people could make human clones, but Poo does not plan to do so. Poo also says it is important because it shows somatic cell nuclear transfer could be used to make monkeys that are genetically exactly the same, for experiments. Doctors that study the human heart already use crab-eating macaques as a model organism when they study problems with the blood vessels around the heart. Poo said monkeys like Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua could be used to learn more about neuroscience, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease when he talked on the radio news program \"All Things Considered\" in January 2018.\nAcademics who study right and wrong in science, like Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University, asked if people would make human clones anyway. Poo told \"All Things Considered\", \"Technically speaking one can clone human[s]\u00a0... But we're not going to do it. There's absolutely no plan to do anything on humans.\""}

Its capital is the city of Kaduna. It is one of the 36 states located in the northern area of Nigeria, and is the ninth largest state in the country. Hausa is Kaduna State's most widely spoken language, while English is its official language. Other local languages are also spoken, such as Yoruba, Igbo, Fula and English Creole among others. Some of these local languages are also used in written form. The total population of the state was projected to be 8,252,400 as of March 21, 2016.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe word \"Kaduna\" is thought to be derived from a Gbagyi word for river. Another proposed origin links the name to the Hausa word for crocodile, but this is challenged by the Gbagyi people who are known to have lived in the area for centuries. What is now known as \"Kaduna State\" is mostly made up of land said to have been inhabited by people of the \"Nok\" culture. The name \"Nok\" is derived from the village of Nok in Kaduna, where some of the first major artifacts from the Nok culture were found. The British colonial capital moved from Jebba to Zungeru in 1902, and then to Kaduna in 1916. It is thought that the name Kaduna was taken up by Lord Frederick Lugard and his colleagues during the move to Kaduna.\nKaduna State is located at the center of northern Nigeria. It has political significance as the former administrative headquarters of northern Nigeria during the British colonial era. The state shares boundaries with Niger State to the west, Zamfara, Katsina and Kano States to the north, Bauchi and Plateau States to the east and FCT Abuja and the Nassarawa States to the south. Kaduna State has a land area of 46,053 square kilometers.\nOne major city under the governance of Kaduna is the ancient City of Zaria. once ruled Zaria and was known as a great warrior. Her land stretched as far as Bauchi in the east and as far south as the river Niger. She built a walled town wherever she conquered.\nBritish colonization.\nAt the start of British colonial rule in northern Nigeria, the natives who lived in the area were referred to as the 'Northern Nigerians' - a term which is still used today. On May 27, 1967, the area was broken up into six separate states, one of which was the North-Central State. This name was changed to Kaduna State in 1976. It was then further divided in 1987, losing the area now part of Katsina State. In 1975, the 'Kaduna' State was formally created by the then military leader, General . General Mohammed decided to collect these six different states into one state, and did so without a referendum. This new state is the successor of what was called the 'Northern Region of Nigeria'.\nPeople.\nThe people in Kaduna State mostly belong to the Hausa, Gbagyi, Adara, Ham, Atyap, Bajjuu and Agworok ethnic groups.\nThe main ethnic groups are Hausa and Fulani, whose people are mostly Muslim. There are about 30 ethnic groups in the south, the largest being Gbari (Gwari). The majority of the people in the south are Christians. The major Muslim festivals are the \"Salah\", celebrations of \"Id EI Fitri\" and \"Id EI Kabir\". Christmas, New Year's Day and Easter are observed by the Christian population.\nImmigrants arrive into the cities as \"Fadama\" farmers and market gardening workers (\"yan lambu\" in Hausa). The children are usually students in Qur'anic schools or dry season immigrant workers (\"yan cin rani\" in Hausa) and live mostly in Zaria.\nGeography.\nThe Kaduna River, a tributary of the Niger River, flows roughly east to west through the center of the state. The state\u2019s natural plant life is mostly Sudanian Savanna. This plant life is mostly made up of short trees, shrubs and several types of grass. The soil in Kaduna consists mostly of loam. Clay can also be found in this area. Native minerals include serpentine, asbestos, amethyst, kyanite, and gold. Graphite and sillimanite graphite can also be found here. This is an important raw material used in the manufacture of pencils, crucibles, electrodes, generator brushes and other parts.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is the largest part of the economy, with about 80% of the people working in farming. The main crops are yams, cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), tobacco, maize, beans, guinea corn, millet, ginger, rice, and cassava. Over 180,000 tons of groundnuts (peanuts) are produced in the state every year. The main cash crop is cotton. Livestock can include cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs.\nKaduna State is an industrial center of northern Nigeria. Manufactured goods include carpets, textiles, machinery, steel, aluminum, petroleum products, bearings, reinforced concrete materials, bicycle assembly, toiletries, and cigarettes. Goods that are produced for the population to use range from dairy products to soft drinks, flour and groundnut (peanut) oil. The textile industry is not doing well because of foreign competition.\nImportant companies in the state area are the Federal Super Phosphate Fertilizer Company PLC, Ideal Flour Mills PLC, New Nigerian Packaging Company PLC, Peugeot Automobile Nigeria PLC, United Wire Products Limited, Bus and Refrigerated Van Manufacturing Co, Kaduna Furniture and Carpets Company Limited, Electricity Metres Company Nigeria Limited and Rigid Pack Containers Limited, Zaria.\nAlso located in the state are the National Leather Research Institute, Zaria, the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria and the nation's third-largest petroleum refinery."}
