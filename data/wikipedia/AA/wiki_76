It began on 10 May 1857 at Meerut, as a mutiny of sepoys of the British East India Company's army. Sepoys in the Presidency of Bengal revolted against their British officers.\nCauses.\nThe causes of the mutiny are hard to pin down, and have been much argued about. Before the Rebellion, there were 50,000 British troops, and 300,000 Sepoy serving in the East India Company military. \nThe forces were divided into three presidency armies: Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The make-up of these armies varied from region to region.\nThe Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such as Rajputs and Bhumihar brahmins. They cut back the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras Army and Bombay Army were \"more localised, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\". The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.\nThere were some changes in the terms of their service which may have created resentment. As the East India Company expanded, soldiers were now expected to serve in less familiar regions, such as in Burma, and also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration they had got previously. Another financial grievance stemmed from the general service act, which denied retired sepoys a pension. This applied only to new recruits, but older sepoys suspected that it might bied apply to those already in service. Also, the Bengal Army was paid less than the Madras and Bombay Armies, which increased their fears over pensions.\nFlash point.\nThe immediate event which angered the sepoys was about the ammunition for the new rifles they had to use were Enfield rifles. The cartridges that were used in the new rifles had to be bitten open. The Muslims were angry because they thought that the paper cartridges had pig fat in them. This was because Muslims believe that pigs are unclean. Hindu soldiers were angry because they believed the cartridges had cow fat in them. On January 27, Colonel Richard Birch ordered that no cartridges should have grease on them, and that sepoys could grease them with whatever they wanted.\nDuring the 1850s the British rulers continued to forcibly take some regions, ruled by Indians and made these regions (for example: the kingdom of Agra and Oudh, part of the present day Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which was seized in 1856) part of the British kingdom. Lord Dalhousie was the Governor General who decided to do this which was against Hindu customs. They did not give any respect to old royal houses of India like the Mughals (nominally Emperors of India) and the Peshwas (the most powerful of the Maratha rulers, leaders of the Maratha Confederacy).\nEvents.\nRebellion broke out when a soldier called Mangal Pandey attacked a British sergeant and wounded an adjutant while his regiment was in Barrackpore. General Hearsey ordered another Indian soldier to arrest Mangal Pandey but he refused. Later the British arrested Mangal Pandey and the other Indian soldier. The British killed both by hanging them because what they had done was thought to be treachery. All other soldiers of that regiment lost their places in the army. On May 10th 1857, cavalry troops while doing parade at Meerut broke ranks. They freed the soldiers of the 3rd regiment, and they moved towards Delhi. Soon many Indians of north India joined these soldiers. They entered the Delhi Fort where Bahadur Shah II, the Mughal Emperor, lived, and asked him to become leader of the rebellion. He agreed unwillingly. Very soon the revolt spread throughout north India. Important Indian leaders of royal families joined the rebellion, and started fighting the British at several places. They included: Ahmed Ullah, an advisor of the ex-King of Oudh; Nana Saheb, his nephew Rao Saheb, and his retainers, Tantia Tope and Rani Lakshmibai; the Rani of Jhansi; Kunwar Singh; the Rajput chief of Jagadishpur in Bihar; and Firuz Saha, a relative of the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah.\nAt the beginning the British were slow to respond. Then they took very quick action with heavy forces. They brought their regiments from the Crimean War to India. They also redirected many regiments that were going to China to India. The British forces reached Delhi, and they surrounded the city from 1st July 1857 until 31st August 1857. Eventually street-to-street fights broke out between the British troops and the Indians. Ultimately, they took control of Delhi. The massacre at Kanpur (July 1857) and the siege of Lucknow (June to November 1857) were also very important.\nBattle of Gwalior.\nThe last important battle was at Gwalior (now in Madhya Pradesh) in June 1858 in which the Rani of Jhansi was killed; a few days later the British retook the fortress of Gwalior. With this, the British had practically suppressed the rebellion. However, some guerrilla fighting in many places continued until early in 1859 as Tantia Tope was captured and executed on April 1859.\nBritish Reaction.\nThe rebellion was an event of great importance in the front of history of modern India. The Parliament of the United Kingdom withdrew the right of the British East India Company to rule India in November 1858. The United Kingdom started ruling India directly through its representative called the Governor General. It made India a part of the British Empire. It promised \"the Princes, Chiefs, and People of India,\" equal treatment under the British law. In 1877, Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of India and the Viceroy of India ruled India for her. \nThe British sent Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal Emperor, out of India, and kept him in Yangon (then called Rangoon), Burma where he died in 1862. The Mughal dynasty, which had ruled India for about four hundred years, ended with his death.\nThe British also took many steps to employ members of Indian higher castes and rulers in the government. They started employing Indians in the civil services but at lower levels. They stopped taking the lands of the remaining princes and rulers of India. They stopped interference in religious matters. They increased the number of British soldiers, and allowed only British soldiers to handle artillery.\nOpinions.\nIn England, newspapers focused on the violence of the mutiny. Charles Dickens wrote that they (the English) should take revenge in his 1857 novella \"The perils of certain English prisoners\"."}

This is called a one-party dominant state. In this case opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. For example, in China all power is vested in the Communist Party of China. Other parties are allowed to exist only if they accept the leading role of the Communist Party\nThe Soviet Union from 1922\u20131991, Nazi Germany from 1933\u20131945, Italy under Benito Mussolini from 1922\u20131943, and various Eastern Bloc states are some of the best-known examples of one-party states in history. Some one-party states are considered dictatorships and called a police state or a military dictatorship, if a secret police force or the military is used to keep a dictator in power through force.\nThe one-party system is also a common trait of communist Marxist-Leninist and fascist political philosophies.\nExamples.\nAs of October 1st 2020, there are 9 states that are ruled by a single party:\nFormer examples of one-party states.\nThose are states whose were formerly ruled by single parties:\nSimilar situations.\n\"De facto\" one-party states.\nCountries where other parties are legal, but none exists at present. Also, in some kingdoms a royal family actually rules the country with or without political parties.

In some cases state power is used directly and indirectly to prevent smaller parties getting more votes. This can include electoral fraud, gerrymandering or court decisions (which are controlled by the government). In many cases, opposition leaders and other figures are prevented from using the mass media at election time, and also they often are threatened, harassed, jailed and even killed. In other cases, apart from the government candidates, only candidates from smaller allied parties and \"independent\" candidates who are closely allied to the dominant ruling party, get an overwhelming advantage.\nIn these cases, the defeat of the government \"cannot be expected for the forseeable future\"."}

Three genotypes are possible in a population: Hb+Hb+ producing a normal phenotype; Hb+Hbs the heterozygote; and HbsHbs homozygous for sickle cell anaemia.\nFitness.\nThe fitness of these three genotypes varies according to the environment. In the temperate zone, the normal homozygotes and the heterozygotes will leave most offspring. This is because the homozygote for sickle cell has less chance of surviving to leave children, and if they do survive, they will have many health problems.\nIn a tropical climate, such as equatorial Africa, malaria is a big killer. There, the heterozygote has the advantage in fitness. They do not get malaria so badly, and they do not suffer the earlier deaths of the homozygote sickle cell sufferers.\nNot surprisingly, the Hbs gene is present in about a quarter of Africans from the countries near the equator. In Europeans it is a rare gene. \nPolymorphism.\nHeterozygote advantage is probably the main cause of polymorphism in biological species. Polymorphism, alternate genetic types in a population (for example different blood groups), is extremely common. The fitness of the heterozygotes keeps a wide range of alternate gene alleles in a population. This, in turn, gives the population a wide range of genetic 'resources' and this gives a better chance of survival."}

It is administratively part of Aitutaki, but does not belong to any district or tapere of Aitutaki. It is, however, part of Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara Constituency.\nManuae is a true atoll sitting on the peak of a submerged volcano which descends 4000 meters to the ocean bed. It is made of two horseshoe-shaped islets, \"Manuae\" to the west and \"Te Au O Tu\" to the east, with a total area of 6.17 km\u00b2on either side of a lagoon about 7 km x 4 km. Manuae has an area of 2.1 km\u00b2, and Te Au O TU of 3.9 km\u00b2. The lagoon is 13 km\u00b2 in size, shallow and subject to large shifting sand banks. A coral reef surrounds the atoll and there is no passage through the reef.\nThe island is a marine park and is an important breeding ground for seabirds and marine turtles in the Central Pacific. The offshore waters of Manuae are good fishing grounds. \nCaptain James Cook sighted Manuae on September 23 1773. It was the first of the Cook Islands he voyaged to. Initially he named it Sandwich Island but changed it to Hervey Island in honor of Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol, then a Lord of the Admiralty when he decided instead give the name of \"Sandwich Islands\" to the Hawaiian Islands. This name was later corrupted to Hervey's Island, or Hervey's Isle, and later applied to the entire southern group, as the Hervey Islands. This name remained popular until 1824 when the islands were renamed the Cook Islands by the Russian cartographer von Krusenstern, in honor of Capt. Cook who had died in 1779. \nIn April/May 1965 the population briefly increased to 120 when the island was visited by six expeditions (from Australia, N.Z., Japan, U.K., U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.) to observe the total solar eclipse of 1965 May 30.\nNorwegian author Erlend Loe writes humorously about an expedition to Manuae in his 1999 novel \"L\".\nThe island once supported a small copra industry with a settlement established next to the small reef passage less than one kilometer northeast of Turakino, the westernmost point of the atoll. The passage, at the sea entrance, is less than 4 metres wide and in a swell is exceedingly dangerous without local knowledge.\nThe island has an airfield that has been out of use for several years.\nFishermen from Aitutaki occasionally organise trips to Manuae. All regulations applicable to Aitutaki, apply to Manuae as well.\nThe population peaked with 32 at the 1956 census, but twenty years later the island was abandoned:"}

This growth in the 1920s greatly affected the USA throughout the 20th century and today as the world superpower.\nNatural resources and a growing population income.\nThe USA had many natural resources, for example oil in Texas, coal in the Appalachian Mountains, and ranching in the Midwest and Great Plains. This meant there was no need to buy natural resources from other countries. Moreover the population of the USA was growing very fast making a very big market for natural resources inside the USA which grew quickly.\nBelow is a table in which the population growth in millions is shown in the 40 years after the 1920s:\n Below is a table which shows the urban growth in the six largest cities by population, in 1870 and 1910:\nThe First World War.\nDuring the First World War, the USA was selling lots of metal to Britain and France, and also weapons. The USA made a lot of money from this. Also, the USA took over Europe's international trade and became the world leader in; chemical manufacturing, explosives manufacturing, and plastics manufacturing, along with others. This was very good for the US economy.\nRepublican Party Policies.\nThe Republican Party at the time had policies which were very useful for a large economic growth:\n1. The Republicans had a 'laissez-faire' way of thinking, which meant that the government would not stand in the way of people's lives and businesses. The Republican Party believed that this would create much profit, and it did.\n2. The Republicans made 'tariffs', which meant that it cost a lot of money to buy products from other countries. This protected American businessmen from foreign competition. This also made the American people buy American-made products.\n3. The Republicans lowered taxes, which was good for normal people, and even better for rich people. The Republican Party believed that low taxes would make people keep their money and spend it on American-made products and put money into American industries.\n4. The Republicans allowed 'trusts'. Trusts were very large corporations, or businesses, which controlled almost all of a certain industry. Many people did not like these trusts as they did not want one corporation to control an entire industry, but the Republican Party said that a corporation would do business better than a politician. These trusts were very important in causing this economic growth.\nThere were also problems with the policies. During the 1920s, much of the wealth in the United States was controlled by only a few people. Also, farmers and other people who worked in the business of farming found it very difficult to make money and were therefore very poor. \nNew industries, new methods.\nThe fact that there were new industries created new ways of managing industries. For example, new products such as telephones, radios, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and others were being made on a large scale, but at a cheaper price. Very good advertising was also created for many products. The largest new industry in the 1920s was the motorcar industry. It had been made entirely different by Henry Ford. By the year 1929, 4.8 million cars had been made.\nHoover (vacuum cleaners) became a household name. The biggest growth was in radios. In 1920, there were 60,000 radios sold. By 1929, it was 10 million. The total production of American industry increased by around 50%.\nThe American state of mind.\nAt the time, most Americans believed that they deserved success. For example; a nice house, a good job, plenty to eat, and many consumer goods. The act of 'consuming' was seen as very American, and this belief that spending and consuming was Russian , had a huge impact on powering economic growth in the 1920s"}

Grey matter contains nerve cell bodies, and white matter is made of the nerve fibres. \nWhen a sample is freshly cut, it usually slightly pink in appearance (for both types). When preserved in formaldehyde, white matter appears to be almost white. White matter consists mostly of myelinated axons:. Myelin is a lipid tissue (a fat) with capillaries. It helps to keep the electrical in the nerve fibre. This is important for fast and accurate sending of signals. In the brain white matter is surrounded by grey matter most of the time. In the spine, white matter is outside, and grey matter inside: the myelin sourrounds the nerve cells, and helps the transmission of nerve signals.\nWhite matter is used to connect different areas of grey matter. If a section of white matter is damaged, the brain may be able to find a different route to replace the lost connection. The brain contains a third kind of tissue, which appears darker. It is called substantia nigra, a part of the brain that is involved in pleasure &amp; reward, addiction and movement. "}

If both parents have the gene the chances are increased to 75%, but in 25% of the cases, it is very unlikely that the child would live more than a few months. However, the condition can also occur without either parent having the gene. Achondroplasia is caused by a change in the DNA for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This change affects the making of cartilage. Now that the part of the DNA that causes the condition is known, there is hope that new treatments may be developed."}

In 1893 he married Mary Baird Baillie.\nFrom 1903 to 1910 he was Professor of Zoology and Geology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch, South Africa, and subsequently he became keeper of vertebrate palaeontology at the South African Museum, Cape Town.\nContributions.\nBroom was first known for his study of mammal-like reptiles. After Raymond Dart's discovery of the Taung Child, an infant australopithecine, Broom's interest in palaeoanthropology was heightened. Broom's career seemed over and he was sinking into poverty, when Dart wrote to Jan Smuts about the situation. Smuts put pressure on the South African government, and managed to get a position for Broom. In 1934 he joined the staff of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria as Assistant in Palaeontology.\nIn the following years, he and John T. Robinson made a series of spectacular finds, including fragments from six hominids in Sterkfontein, which they named \"Plesianthropus transvaalensis\", but which was later classified as an adult \"Australopithecus africanus\", as well as more discoveries at sites in Kromdraai and Swartkrans.\nIn 1937, Broom made his most famous discovery of \"Paranthropus robustus\". These discoveries helped support Dart's claims for the Taung species.\nThe remainder of Broom's career was devoted to the exploration of these sites and the interpretation of the many early hominid remains discovered there. For his volume, \"The South Africa fossil ape-men, the Australopithecinae\", in which he proposed the Australopithecinae subfamily, Broom was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1946. He continued to write to the very last. Shortly before his death he finished a monograph on the Australopithecines and remarked to his nephew:&lt;br&gt;\nAssessment of his work.\n\"More than any scientist before or since, Broom's work on \"Australopithecus\" fundamentally revised the study of fossil man... The significant point is that Broom assigned all except one of these to a single zoological subfamily the australopithecines, and made it quite clear that [they] were good candidates for the ancestry of mankind\"."}

Carls. The movie was released on September 29, 2006 and received mixed reviews from reviewers.\nPlot.\nIn the tranquil town of Timberline, 900-pound grizzly bear Boog (Martin Lawrence) enjoys a captive, but happy existence. He spends his day as the star attraction of the town's nature show and spends his nights living the life of luxury in the garage of the park ranger Beth (Debra Messing), who raised Boog since he was a cub.\nOne day, the hunting fanatic Shaw (Gary Sinise) drives into town with the one-antlered buck mule deer, Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) strapped to the hood of his truck. Boog accidentally wakes him and the two scream in terror. With Boog reluctant to intervene, Elliot begs Boog to help. At the last minute and against his better judgement, Boog frees Elliot before Shaw can go after him. Boog never expects to see his \"buddy\" again.\nElliot follows Boog home and finds him sleeping in the garage and starts to throw rabbits at the window to wake him. Elliot tells Boog the he is intent on returning the favor by \"freeing\" him from his garage captivity. Boog refuses to go with Elliot, but he still goes with Elliot when Elliot shows him a chocolate bar (which he calls a Woo Hoo Bar) and tells him that they can get more outside. Elliot begins to introduce Boog to a world of sweet temptations outside of the garage that he has never known. The two head for \"Puni Mart\", a convenience store. Boog and Elliot ransack the Puni Mart, causing a mess. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth, Sheriff Gordy (Gordon Tootoosis). Back home, Gordy tells Beth that it would be better if Boog were released into the wild.\nDuring the nature show, Elliot, chased by Shaw, runs backstage and locks the door. Boog gets mad remembering the events Elliot made him go through. Boog attacks the buck, making the audience panic (because it looks as of Boog is killing Elliot behind the curtain) before Boog threatens to kill Elliot. The two crash out of the curtains. Shaw prepares to shoot Boog, but the bear is instead shot by Beth with a tranquilizer gun; she shoots Elliot as well (six times in the butt). The duo are released into the Timberline National Forest, only three days before the start of open season.\nBoog wakes up and realizes he has been released into the forest, and threatens to throw Elliot off a cliff, stating that Elliot drove him to this. Boog eventually throws Elliot into the air rather than throwing him off the cliff. Elliot's antlers get stuck in the ground, and while Boog goes around the forest in circles in search of Timberline, Elliot tries to break free. Boog decides to get familiar with the forest and tries to climb up a tree, but is attacked by a Scottish red squirrel called McSquizzy (Billy Connolly) and his gang. Soon, Boog gives up and frees Elliot and takes him as his hapless guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth. But in the woods, they quickly learn that it's every animal for itself. The two run into their share of the forest animals including hot-tempered skunks (Nika Futterman and Michelle Murdocca), psychotic ducks (Danny Mann and Maddie Taylor) and panic-stricken rabbits. They also run into critters such as Reilly (Jon Favreau) and his beaver construction worker team, and a porcupine (Maddie Taylor) who's in search of a buddy. With each adverse encounter, Boog learns a little about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect. Elliot finds his herd crush, a pretty female, Giselle (Jane Krakowski), but is also found by the herd leader, Ian (Patrick Warburton), a \"jock\" mule deer who had forced Elliot out of the herd before. They walk away from Ian's taunting, realizing that they've obtained true friendship.\nElliot tries to lead Boog out of the forest, but gets lost. Boog realizes they are meeting the same animals again and again. After winding up at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw. Boog tries to run over the dam, but it's not a \"load bearing structure\". It breaks under his weight and the rush of water washes everyone in the forest, including Shaw, to the clearing below the 'falls.\nEveryone blames Boog, but he accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home. Elliot confesses, saying he wanted Boog as a friend and thought if they just spent time together it would work out. Angry, Boog leaves, attempting to find Timberline on his own. He unwittingly find Shaw's log cabin. Shaw discovers him and pursues him. Boog flees to the city road where he finds trucks with hunters in them, zooming past him and he soon finds the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog decides to take Elliot with him, but the other animals want to live in the garage too, but they realize there is no way out because the hunters have already gathered around the forest. Boog decides that they should defend themselves, and they collect supplies from Bob and Bobby's (two scientists) RV while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron) joins the animals.\nThe following day, Boog witnesses the hunters coming, and sends a signal to the animals by flinging one of the mule deers of the herd in the air. Elliot receives the signal and sends out the ducks, who are carrying skunks, into the air, causing stinky green air to flow around the forest. Meanwhile, Elliot and the squirrels ride on the mule deers and charge. On the other side, Boog and the other animals charge too, causing a big rampage. The ducks drop a tank of gas (called \"Mr. Happy\" by McSquizzy) onto one of the hunters trucks, but it goes out, so McSquizzy flings some dynamite into the air, and all the trucks blow up, and the hunters all run away. All the animals start celebrating. Suddenly, Shaw appears, and attempts to kill Boog with his gun, but Elliot shoots things that they had stolen from the RV. One of the objects hits the gun, and the gun falls out of reach. Shaw then proceeds to attack Boog with his hunting knife. Boog beats him with a golf club Elliot had shot. Shaw, within reaching distance of his gun, grabs it, and attempts to shoot Boog. Elliot takes the bullet meant for Boog, enraging Boog who tackles Shaw, roars loudly in his face, then ties him up with his own gun. Boog finds that Elliot survived the wound, only losing his second antler in the fight. Beth returns to take Boog back home where he will be safe, but he instead stays with his friends. They both realize that the bear \"is\" at home in the forest. Earlier, the animals attack Shaw, pouring honey and putting feathers on Shaw. Finally, Shaw is free and with panic runs into the forest.\nProduction.\nThe idea for the movie came from cartoonist Steve Moore, known for his comic strip \"In the Bleachers\". Moore and producer John Carls submitted the story to Sony in June 2002, and the movie immediately went into development. On February 29, 2004, Sony Pictures Animation announced the beginning of the production on its first CGI animated feature, \"Open Season\".\nThe movie location was inspired by the towns of Sun Valley, Idaho and McCall, Idaho, and the Sawtooth National Forest. References to the Lawn Lake, Colorado, Dam flood, Longs Peak, and other points of interest in the area are depicted in the movie.\nThe Sony animation team developed a digital tool called shapers that allowed the animators to re-shape the character models into stronger poses and silhouettes and subtle distortions such as squash, stretch, and smears, typical of traditional, hand-drawn animation.\nMartin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher, the voices of Boog and Elliot, never met during production.\nReception.\n\"Open Season\" received mixed reviews from critics. Critics of Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie 48% with the consensus \"Open Season is a cliched palette of tired jokes and CG animal shenanigans that have been seen multiple times this cinematic year.\"\nKevin Smith gave the movie a good review during an appearance as a guest critic on \"At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper\" saying \"If your kids like poop jokes as much as I do, \"Open Season\" will put a big smile on their faces.\" However, Richard Roeper gave the movie a mixed review saying \"It's just okay, the animation is uninspired.\"\nThe movie opened #1 with $23 million on its opening weekend. It grossed $85.1 million in the United States and $104.8 million in foreign countries making $189.9 million worldwide.\n\"Rolling Stone\" gave the movie's soundtrack three stars out of five, as did Allmusic.\nHome media.\n\"Open Season\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD Video on January 30, 2007. It was later released on 3D Blu-ray on November 16, 2010.\nTelevision series.\nA TV show, \"Boog and Elliot's Big Adventure\", was to air in March 2012.\nVideo game.\nA video game based on the movie was released on many platforms in 2006/2007.\nSequels.\n\"Open Season\" was given two direct-to-video sequels: \"Open Season 2\" (which was in 2009), and \"Open Season 3\" (which was in 2011)."}

Its far northern end crosses into Ethiopia. \nIt is the world's largest permanent desert lake and the world's largest alkaline lake. By volume it is the world's fourth-largest salt lake after the Caspian Sea, Issyk-Kul Lake and the (shrinking) Aral Sea. Among all lakes, it ranks 24th in area.\nThe water is drinkable, but not palatable. It supports a rich lacustrine wildlife. The climate is hot and very dry. \nThe rocks of the surrounding area are predominantly volcanic. Central Island is an active volcano, emitting vapors. Outcrops and rocky shores are found on the East and South shores of the lake, while dunes, spits and flats are on the West and North, at a lower elevation.\nOn-shore and off-shore winds can be extremely strong as the lake warms and cools more slowly than the land. Sudden, violent storms are frequent. Three rivers (the Omo, Turkwel and Kerio) flow into the lake, but lacking outflow, its only water loss is by evaporation. Lake volume and dimensions are variable. For example, its level fell by between 1975 and 1993.\nDue to temperature, aridity and geographic inaccessibility, the lake retains its wild character. Many Nile crocodiles are on the flats. The rocky shores are home to scorpions and carpet vipers. Although the lake and its environs have been popular for expeditions of every sort under the tutelage of guides, rangers and experienced persons, they certainly must be considered hazardous for unguided tourists.\nLake Turkana National Parks are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sibiloi National Park lies on the lake's eastern shore, while Central Island National Park and South Island National Park are in the lake. Both have crocodiles.\nThe Lake Turkana area is regarded by many anthropologists as the cradle of humankind because there are many hominid fossils. The skeleton of Turkana boy was found near the lake in 1984."}

Leakey, 7 August 1903 \u2013 1 October 1972) was a Kenyan archaeologist, anthropologist and naturalist.\nHis work was important in establishing human evolutionary development in East Africa. He also played a major role in creating organizations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there.\nLeakey was the third of the three great anthropologists of British origin who made Africa their home: the others were Robert Broom and Raymond Dart.\nHe started a tradition of palaeoanthropological inquiry in Kenya. His own family carried on the 'family firm'. Several of them became well-known anthropologists and fossil hunters.\nLouis took part in national events of British East Africa and then Kenya at critical times.\nIn biology he asserted Charles Darwin's theory of evolution unswervingly, and set about to prove Darwin's hypothesis that man arose in Africa. He was also a devout Christian.chapter 3 \nPalaeoanthropologist par excellence.\nVindication at Olduvai.\nLouis and Mary spent all the time they could at Olduvai Gorge, starting in 1951. So far they had discovered only stone tools. A more extensive excavation came in 1952. They found what Louis termed an Oldowan \"slaughter-house\", an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered. Louis was so carried away that he worked without his hat and his hair was bleached white from the sun. They stopped in 1953.\nIn 1955 they excavated again with Jean Brown. She related that he preferred to be called Louis, was absent-minded, once had everyone looking for spectacles that were around his neck, wore pants with the buttons off and shoes with holes in them, charged about everywhere and once collapsed unconscious. He was completely happy.chapter 12\nIn 1959 they decided to excavate Bed I. While Louis was sick in camp, Mary discovered the fossilized skull OH 5, which Mary called \"Our Man\", and became \"Dear Boy\" and \"Zinj.\" The question was whether it was a previous genus discovered by Robert Broom, \"Paranthropus\", which Broom had taken not to be in the human line, or a different one, in it. Louis opted for Zinj, a decision opposed by Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, but one which attracted the attention of Melville Bell Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society. That contact resulted in an article in \"National Geographic\", and a hefty grant to continue work at Olduvai.\nZinj was far older than anyone had imagined. Scientists swarmed to Africa. Louis had proved Darwin right.chapter 13\nThe Leakey circus.\nIn 1960, unable to leave the museum except on weekends, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba tribesmen, instead of Kikuyu, who, she felt, took advantage of Louis. The first, Muteva Musomba, had kept her children's ponies. He recruited Kamoya Kimeu among others. Mary set up Camp 5 under Jonathan's direction. He was 19. From then on she had her own staff and associates.\nMary picked and sieved at the site from early morning dressed in old clothes, chain smoking cigarettes, always surrounded by her Dalmatian. She and Louis communicated by radio. On weekends he drove non-stop at high speed the 357\u00a0miles between Olduvai and Nairobi. The teen-age boys, Richard and Philip, were on site during holidays and vacations.\nTheir home in Nairobi was a circus, figuratively speaking, when they were there. Dinner guests were frequent. Important guests stayed for weeks if they could stand it. They shared the quarters and the dinner table with the Dalmatians, hyraxes, a monkey, a civet cat, an African eagle owl, tropical fish, snakes, such as vipers, and a python.\nThe extended families of twenty African staff lived in cinderblock huts in the yard. Mary had switched to cigars and the ashes often fell into the food. Both Louis and Mary cooked. Louis never stopped talking; his stories were endless. He literally ran through the day, making long lists of things to be done, which he never completed. He drove recklessly through the streets of Nairobi, often reading and writing as he drove.chapter 5\nThere was another side to the Leakey family. Louis was a notorious womanizer. He was faithful neither to Frida nor to Mary. Mary tolerated this behavior well until his relationship with Rosalie Osborn, 1954/55, threatened to break up her marriage.chapter 17\nThe two fought constantly, upsetting the boys. After Richard nearly died in a fall from a horse, Louis broke with Rosalie for the sake of the boys.\nFloruit.\nJonathan achieved some brief fame before he quit palaeoanthropology altogether. He started his own site, \"Jonny's site\" in the Leakey lingo, FLK-NN. There he discovered two skull fragments without the Australopithecine sagittal crest, which Mary connected with Broom's and Robinson's Telanthropus. The problem was its contemporaneity with Zinj. Mailed photographs, Le Gros Clark retorted casually \"Shades of Piltdown\". Louis cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion of his incompetence. Clark apologized.chapter 14\nIn 1960 Louis, his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil he termed \"Chellean Man\", as it was in context with Oldowan tools, the first such find. After reconstruction Louis and Mary called it \"Pinhead.\" It was subsequently included with \"Homo erectus\" and was in fact contemporaneous with \"Paranthropus\", which on that account cannot have been in the human line. For many years Louis believed erectus was the user of the tools and \"Australopithecus\" was not.\nIn 1961 Louis got a salary as well as a grant from National Geographic and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate. He created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds, moved his collections to it, and appointed himself director. This was his new operations center.\nHe opened another excavation at Fort Ternan on Lake Victoria. Shortly after, Heselon discovered \"Kenyapithecus wickeri\", the species name from the owner of the property, which Louis promptly celebrated with George Gaylord Simpson, who happened to be present, aboard the \"Miocene Lady\" with Leakey Safari Specials, a drink made of condensed milk and cognac.\nIn 1962 Louis was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of \"Homo habilis\" at MNK. Louis and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella, or Cindy. Phillip Tobias identified Jonny's Child with it and Raymond Dart came up with the name \"Homo habilis\" at Louis' request, which Tobias translated as 'handyman'.chapter 16 It was seen as intermediary between gracile \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\".chapter 16\nLeakey's Angels.\nOne of Louis's greatest legacies was fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats. He understood this helped to unravel the mysteries of human evolution. He chose three female researchers: Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birute Galdikas. They were dubbed 'Leakey's Angels'. Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology.\nBooks.\nA selection:\nThe family.\nProminent family members.\nLouis Leakey was married to Mary Leakey, who made the noteworthy discovery of fossil footprints at Laetoli. Found preserved in volcanic ash in Tanzania, they are the earliest record of bipedal gait.\nHe is also the father of paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey and the botanist Colin Leakey. Louis' cousin, Nigel Gray Leakey, was a recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II."}

It is in the eastern Serengeti Plains in northern Tanzania.\nThe Gorge is about long. It is 45\u00a0km from the Laetoli archaeological site. The gorge is a highly important prehistoric site for the study of human evolution. It was once a lake, and got covered by layers of volcanic ash.\nThis site was occupied by \"Homo habilis\" about 1.9 million years ago, \"Paranthropus boisei\" 1.8 million years ago, and \"Homo erectus\" 1.2 million years ago. \"Homo sapiens\" occupied the site 17,000 years ago.\nThe name is a misspelling of Oldupai Gorge, which was adopted as the official name in 2005. Oldupai is the Maasai word for the wild sisal plant \"Sansevieria ehrenbergii\", which grows in the gorge.\nGeology.\nMillions of years ago, the site was that of a large lake, the shores of which were covered with successive deposits of volcanic ash.\nAbout 500,000 years ago seismic activity diverted a nearby stream which began to cut down into the sediments, revealing seven main layers in the walls of the gorge. The geology of Olduvai Gorge and the surrounding region was studied in detail by Richard L. Hay, who worked at the site between 1961 and 2002.\nThe stratigraphy is extremely deep and layers of volcanic ash and stones allow radiometric dating of the embedded artifacts, mostly through potassium\u2013argon dating and argon\u2013argon dating. The base of the Olduvai sediments dates to slightly older than 2 million years,\nThe nearby site Laetoli has a much older fossil record.\nPalaeontology.\nOlduvai Gorge is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world and has been instrumental in furthering understanding of early human evolution. Chasing a fancy butterfly in the green wilds of Tanganyika 50 years ago, a German entomologist named (Wilhelm) Kattwinkel tumbled off a rocky ledge and nearly killed himself. When he regained his senses, he found himself in an anthropologist's dream world: an erosion-created rift with layer after layer of fossils, bones and ancient artifacts. The find was named Olduvai Gorge, and Kattwinkel's heirs ever since have been scrambling up and down its sun-baked sides in search of clues to man's earliest awakening. (\"Time\", Friday 10 March 1961) \nExcavation work there was pioneered by Louis and Mary Leakey beginning in 1931. It is still going on.\nThe earliest archaeological deposit, known as Bed I, has produced evidence of campsites and living floors along with stone tools made of flakes from local basalt and quartz. Since this is the site where these kinds of tools were first discovered, these tools are called Oldowan. It is now thought that the Oldowan toolmaking tradition started about 2.6 million years ago. Bones from this layer are not of modern humans but earlier hominid forms of \"Paranthropus boisei\" and the first discovered specimens of \"Homo habilis\".\nThe site of FLK North has the oldest known evidence of Elephant consumption, attributed to \"Homo ergaster\" around 1.8 million years ago. A nearly complete skeleton of the extinct \"Elephas recki\" was found in the lowest of its six occupation levels along with stone tools such as choppers and flakes. Large numbers of bone fragments of smaller animals found with it clearly identify FLK North as an early butchering site.\nAbove this, in Bed II, pebble tools begin to be replaced by more sophisticated handaxes of the Acheulean industry and made by \"H. ergaster\". This layer has not yet been successfully dated, but likely falls between 1.75 and 1.2 million years.\nBeds III and IV have produced Acheulean tools and fossil bones from more than 600,000 years ago.\nDuring a period of major faulting and volcanism roughly 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, the Masek Beds were made. These beds contained tools from an industry made by modern humans, followed by the Ndutu Beds (400,000 to 32,000 years ago), and the Naisiusiu Beds (22,000 to 15,000 years ago).\nAlso, on the rim of the Gorge, is the Olduvai Gorge Museum. This Museum presents exhibitions about the Gorge's history."}

He is second of the three sons of the anthropologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey.\nLife.\nA high school dropout, Leakey discovered his love of paleontology when he led an expedition to a fossil site he had discovered while flying. Frustrated by the lack of recognition he received for his accomplishments (due to his lack of qualifications) Leakey left for England to catch up on his education. However, after six months, Leakey returned home to continue his safaris. He never completed his degree.\nIn 1965 he married Margaret Cropper. Their daughter Anna was born in 1969, the same year that Richard and Margaret divorced. He then married his colleague Meave Epps in 1970 and they had two daughters, Louise (born 1972) and Samira (1974).\nLeakey was diagnosed with a terminal kidney disease in 1969. Ten years later he became seriously ill, but received a kidney transplant from his brother Philip and recovered to full health.\nIn 1993, a small propeller-driven plane piloted by Richard Leakey crashed, crushing his lower legs. Both legs were later amputated. Sabotage was suspected but never proved. In a few months Richard Leakey was walking again on artificial limbs.\nLeakey said in his autobiography that he is an atheist.\nTeenage entrepreneur.\nRichard chose to support himself, borrowed 500 pounds from his parents for a Land Rover, and went into the trapping and skeleton supply business with Kamoya Kimeu.\nRichard was already a skilled horseman, outdoorsman, Land Rover mechanic, archaeologist and expedition leader, he learned to identify bones. All these skills pointed to a path he did not yet wish to take, simply because his father was on it.\nThe bone business turned into a safari business in 1961. In 1962 he got a private airplane pilot licence and took tours to Olduvai. It was from a casual aerial survey that he noted the potential of Lake Natron's shores for paleontology. He went looking for fossils in a Land Rover, but could find none, until his parents assigned Glynn Isaac to go with him.\nLouis was so impressed with their finds that he gave them National Geographic money for a month's expedition.chapter 18 They explored in the vicinity of Peninj near the lake, where Richard was in charge of the administrative details. Bored, he returned to Nairobi temporarily, but at that moment, Kamoya Kimeu discovered a fossil of \"Australopithecus boisei\". A second expedition left Richard feeling that he was being excluded from the most significant part of the operation, the scientific analysis.\nExpeditions led by Richard Leakey.\nKoobi Fora.\nDuring the Omo expedition of 1967, Richard visited Nairobi and on the return flight the pilot flew over Lake Rudolph (now Lake Turkana) to avoid a thunderstorm. The map led Richard to expect volcanic rock below him but he saw sediments. Visiting the region by helicopter, he saw tools and fossils everywhere. In his mind, he was already planning a new enterprise.\nIn 1969 the discovery of a cranium of \"Paranthropus boisei\" caused great excitement. A \"Homo habilis\" skull and a \"Homo erectus\" skull, discovered in 1972 and 1975, respectively, were among the most significant finds of Leakey's earlier expeditions. In 1978 an intact cranium of \"Homo erectus\" was discovered.\nLeakey and Donald Johanson were at the time considered to be the most famous palaeoanthoropologists, and scientifically their views on human evolution were differing, a scientific rivalry that gained public attention. This culminated at the \"Cronkite's Universe\" talk show hosted by Walter Cronkite in New York in 1981, where Leakey and Johanson held a fierce debate on live TV show.\nWest Turkana.\nTurkana Boy \u2014 discovered by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of the Leakeys' team in 1984 \u2014 was the nearly complete skeleton of a \"Homo ergaster\" (though some, including Leakey, call it \"erectus\") who died 1.6 million years ago at about age 9-12.\nLeakey and Roger Lewin describe the experience of this find and their interpretation of it, in their book \"Origins reconsidered\" (1992). Shortly after the discovery of Turkana Boy, Leakey and his team made the discovery of a skull (known as 'Black Skull') of a new species, \"Australopithecus aethiopicus\" (or \"Paranthropus aethiopicus\").\nRichard shifted away from paleontology in 1989, but his wife Meave Leakey and daughter Louise Leakey still continue paleontological research in Northern Kenya.\nConservation.\nIn 1989 Richard Leakey was appointed the head of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Department (WMCD) by President Daniel Arap Moi in response to the international outcry over the poaching of elephants and the impact it was having on the wildlife of Kenya.\nThe department was replaced by Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) in 1990, and Leakey became its first chairman. With characteristically bold steps Leakey created special, well-armed anti-poaching units that were authorized to shoot poachers on sight. The poaching menace was dramatically reduced. Impressed by Leakey's transformation of the KWS, the World Bank approved grants worth $140 million. Richard Leakey, President Arap Moi and the WMCD made the international news headlines when a stock pile of 12 tons of ivory was burned in 1989 in Nairobi National Park.\nRichard Leakey wrote about his experiences at the KWS in his book \"Wildlife Wars: my battle to save Kenya's elephants\" (2001).\nPolitics.\nIn May 1995 Richard Leakey joined a group of Kenyan intellectuals in launching a new political party \u2014 the Safina Party, which in Swahili means \"Noah's Ark\".\n\"If KANU and Mr. Moi will do something about the deterioration of public life, corruption and mismanagement, I'd be happy to fight alongside them. If they won't, I want somebody else to do it,\" announced Richard Leakey. The Safina party was routinely harassed and even its application to become an official political party was not approved until 1997.\nIn 1999, Moi appointed Richard Leakey as Cabinet Secretary and overall head of the civil service. Moi's hand was forced: the international donor institutions insisted as a pre-condition for the resumption of donor funds. Leakey's second stint in the civil service lasted until 2001 when he was forced to resign again.\nLater activities.\nLeakey joined the Department of Anthropology faculty at Stony Brook University, New York in 2002. He is currently a Professor of Anthropology at Stony Brook, where he is Chair of the Turkana Basin Institute.\nIn 2004, Richard Leakey founded and chaired WildlifeDirect, a Kenya-based charitable organization. The charity was established to provide support to conservationists in Africa directly on the ground via the use of blogs.

{"id": "284967", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284967", "title": "Provisional Irish Republican Army", "text": "The Provisional Irish Republican Army was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that wanted to unite Ireland, by using armed force to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, mainly during The Troubles era. It split from the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1969. Its violent activities formally ended in 1997. During that time, about 10,000 people were members. In 2002, there were about 1,000 people left; 300 of them were still in active service. In July 2005 it destroyed all its weapons and bombs.\nIts opponents were the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteers. The PIRA aimed to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a socialist republic within a united Ireland. It tried to do this through armed attacks and explosions and by using political persuasion.\nThe Provisional Irish Republican Army is also referred to as the IRA, the PIRA, the Provos, or by its supporters as the Army or the 'RA. The PIRA usually refers to its members as volunteers. The IRA is a listed in the UK under the Terrorism Act 2000. It is also listed as an unlawful organisation in the Republic of Ireland. The United States does not list the IRA as a \"foreign terrorist organization\", but includes them in the category of \"other selected terrorist groups also deemed of relevance in the global war on terrorism.\".\nOverview of strategies.\nThe IRA's first strategy was to use force to destroy the Northern Ireland administration and to hurt or kill enough British soldiers and police officers that the British government would leave. The IRA recruited volunteers. They got more volunteers after the 1972 Bloody Sunday attack, in which the British military fired on protesters. The IRA then attacked against British military and economic targets. They were supported by arms and funding from Libya and from some groups in the United States.\nThe IRA agreed to a ceasefire in February 1975, which lasted nearly a year. Then the IRA decided it could not meet its goals with the ceasefire. As a result, the IRA launched a new strategy known as \"the Long War\". This started a war of attrition against the British. As well, they did more political activity through the political party Sinn F\u00e9in.\nThe 1981 Irish hunger strike in helped the IRA to gain support and win elections. This led to the Armalite and ballot box strategy which aimed at doing more political activity. The unsuccessful attempt to do more military attacks led republican leaders to look for a political solution. Sinn F\u00e9in got more distanced from the IRA. Following negotiations with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and with British civil servants, the IRA called a ceasefire in 1994. They expected that Sinn F\u00e9in would be included in political talks for solving the disputes. When the British government demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn F\u00e9in into talks, the IRA called off its ceasefire in February 1996.\nAfter the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into all-party talks. This produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 640 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275\u2013300 members, of an estimated 10,000 total over the 30-year period.\nOn 28 July 2005, the IRA Army Council announced an end to its armed campaign. The IRA stated that it would use only political and democratic processes. Soon after, the IRA destroyed its guns and bombs.\nTwo small groups split from the Provisional IRA, the Continuity IRA in 1986, and the Real IRA in 1997. Both reject the Good Friday Agreement and continue to engage in paramilitary activity."}

Here he rapidly advanced to be lieutenant-colonel, and on Colonel Gerrish's retirement in August 1775, he was placed in command of the regiment, and was soon commissioned colonel.\nUntil the end of 1775, Baldwin and his men stayed near Boston, but in April 1776, he was ordered with his command to New York City. On the night of December 25, 1776, in the face of a violent and extremely cold storm of snow and hail, General Washington and his army crossed the Delaware to the New Jersey side, and fought the Battle of Trenton. Baldwin and his regiment participated in both the crossing and the fight. In 1777, Baldwin resigned from the army because of ill health.\nPolitical career.\nBaldwin was elected to various public offices between 1780 and 1796. He was appointed high sheriff of Middlesex County in 1780, and was the first to hold office after the adoption of the state constitution. From 1778-1784, he represented Woburn in the Massachusetts General Court (the state legislature). In 1794, he was a candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives, and obtained all the votes cast in Woburn but one.\nEngineering career.\nBaldwin began work with his older sons on the Middlesex Canal in 1794 and after nine years, the canal began service in 1803. He later worked on Boston's fortifications. His son Cyrus continued his father's work on the Middlesex Canal as an agent for the canal company. His son Benjamin worked on the Boston Mill Dam for before an early death at age 43."}

{"id": "285071", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285071", "title": "Nuclear espionage", "text": "Nuclear espionage is sharing a country's secrets about nuclear weapons to other countries without permission. Since nuclear weapons have been invented, there have been many cases of known nuclear espionage, and also many cases where it has thought to have happened, but has not been proven. Because nuclear weapons are usually considered the most important of state secrets, all nations with nuclear weapons have strict rules against sharing information about how nuclear weapons are designed, where they are kept, and other things about them. There are also rules that keep countries who have signed non-proliferation agreements (which are meant to stop the spread of nuclear weapons) from sharing information about such weapons with the public.\nManhattan Project.\nDuring the Manhattan Project, which was when the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada worked together during World War II to make the first nuclear weapons, there was much nuclear espionage in which scientists or technicians working for the project sent information about bomb development and designs to the Soviet Union. These people are often called the Atomic Spies, and their work continued into the early Cold War. There has been much disagreement over the exact details of these cases, though some of this was settled when VENONA Project transcripts were made public. These were secret messages between Soviet agents and the Soviet government that were discovered and decoded. Some issues remain unsettled, however.\nSome of the most well known of these were :\nThe Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949. There is disagreement over whether this spying helped the Soviet Union make an atomic bomb faster. While some of the information given, such as information given by Klaus Fuchs, could probably have been very helpful, the way the people in charge of the Soviet bomb project actually used the information has led later scholars to think it did not actually speed up the Soviet Union's process of making bombs much. According to this account, the information was mostly used as a \"check\" against the Soviet Union's own scientists' work, and little of it was actually shared with the Soviet scientists because neither their scientists nor spies were trusted much. Later scholarship has also shown that the biggest problem with the Soviets' early development was not problems designing the weapons, but rather problems getting the materials.\nIsrael.\nIn 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, who had worked at a nuclear facility in Israel, gave information about Israel's nuclear weapons program to the British press. People had thought before that Israel had an advanced and secretive nuclear weapons program and collection, but now they knew for sure. Israel has never said that it does or does not have a nuclear weapons program, and Vanunu was kidnapped and smuggled to Israel, where he was convicted of treason and espionage.\nWhether Vanunu was technically involved in espionage is debated: Vanunu and his supporters say that he should be called a whistle-blower (someone who was exposing something secret and illegal), while his opponents think that he is a traitor and that what he did helped enemies of Israel. After Vanunu left Israel, he did not give his information right away. He travelled for about a year before doing so.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nIn a 1999 report of the United States House of Representatives Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox (called the Cox Report), it was revealed that U.S. security agencies thought there was nuclear espionage going on by the People's Republic of China (PRC) at American nuclear weapons design laboratories. The report said that China had \"stolen classified information on all of the United States' most advanced thermonuclear warheads\" since the 1970s, including the design of advanced warheads, the neutron bomb, and \"weapons codes\" which allow for computer simulations of nuclear testing (and allow China to advance their weapon development without doing its own tests). The United States apparently did not know of this until 1995.\nThe investigations described in the report eventually led to the arrest of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, who was at first accused of giving weapons information to China. The case against Lee eventually fell apart, however, and he was eventually charged only with mishandling of data. Other people and groups arrested or fined were scientist Peter Lee (not related to Wen Ho Lee), who was arrested for allegedly giving submarine radar secrets to China, and Loral Space &amp; Communications and Hughes Electronics, who gave China missile secrets. No other arrests from the theft of the nuclear designs have been made.\nPakistan.\nIn January 2004, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani nuclear scientist, admitted selling restricted nuclear weapons technology to Libya, Iran, and North Korea. According to his testimony and reports from intelligence agencies, Khan sold designs for centrifuges used to enrich uranium and Chinese designs for a nuclear warhead, and sold centrifuges themselves to these three countries. Khan had previously been said to have taken gas centrifuge designs from a uranium enrichment company in the Netherlands (URENCO) which he used to help Pakistan's own nuclear weapons program get started. On February 5, 2004, the president of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, said that he had pardoned Khan. Pakistan's government says that they had no part in the espionage, but refuses to turn Khan over for questioning by the International Atomic Energy Agency."}

{"id": "285094", "revid": "217550", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285094", "title": "American Beauty (movie)", "text": "American Beauty is a 1999 American drama movie directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, played by Mena Suvari. Annette Bening stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. Academics have described the movie as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; further analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.\nBall began writing \"American Beauty\" as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus that accompanied the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. He shelved the play after deciding that the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the movie industry. The rewritten script had a cynical outlook influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took the script for \"American Beauty\" to the fledgling DreamWorks studio, which bought it for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15 million production and served as its North American distributor. \"American Beauty\" marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' movie debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals \"Oliver!\" and \"Cabaret\", Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several A-list directors reportedly turned down the opportunity.\nSpacey was Mendes' first choice for the role of Lester, though DreamWorks urged him to consider better-known actors. Similarly, the studio suggested several actresses for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without the studio's knowledge. Filming took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on sound stages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant directorial style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that softened the cynical tone of Ball's script.\nReleased in North America on September 17, 1999, \"American Beauty\" was acclaimed by critics and audiences; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350 million worldwide. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase \"American Beauty\"'s chances of Oscar success; at the 2000 ceremony the movie won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. The movie was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for directing, writing and acting."}

Left untreated, it can cause heart attacks, strokes, blindness and kidney failure.\nCause.\nUsually, blood sugar levels are regulated by insulin, but in type 2 diabetes this does not work properly. Insulin is a hormone which tells the muscle and fat cells of the body to take up sugar from the blood. If there is too much sugar in the blood for a long period of time, the muscle and fat cells start to ignore insulin. As a result, sugar stays in the blood and is not taken up, leading to a high blood sugar.\nThis situation is different from diabetes mellitus type 1. In this case, the islet cells, which make insulin in the pancreas, have been destroyed by the body, and as a result there is no insulin. Diabetes type 1 usually occurs in children or young adults, whilst diabetes type 2 usually occurs in older people. However, recently childhood obesity has led to some young adults and teenagers developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes makes up around 90% of cases of diabetes, while type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes make up the other 10%.\nType 2 diabetes is a result of both genetics and lifestyle. People who have relatives with diabetes type 2 are at an increased risk. They may develop diabetes if they have other risk factors in their lifestyle, for example obesity, or low amount of exercise.\nComplications.\nPoorly managed diabetes can lead to heart attacks, strokes, blindness and kidney failure.\nTreatment.\nType 2 diabetes can often be treated just by losing weight and exercising more, as these increase the body\u2019s sensitivity to insulin. A medicine called Metformin is often prescribed, which works by helping the fat and muscle cells of the body listen to the signal from insulin to take up sugar from the blood.\nReducing carbohydrate consumption could help with managing type 2 diabetes."}

She starred in the television soap opera \"Another World\". She received a Daytime Emmy Award in 1991. She has starred in many theatrical movies. She is best known for her role in \"Six Days Seven Nights\", where she starred opposite Harrison Ford.\nAs Heche was beginning to establish herself in movies during the late 1990s, her career was negatively affected by her highly publicized same-sex relationship with Ellen DeGeneres. This resulted in Heche losing movie offers.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nAnne Heche's same-sex relationship with comedienne Ellen DeGeneres and the events following their breakup became subjects of widespread media interest. The couple started dating in 1997. At one point, they said they would get a civil union if it became legal in Vermont. They broke up in August 2000. Heche has said that all of her other relationships have been with men.\nAfter the split, Heche began dating cameraman Coleman 'Coley' Laffoon. They married on September 1, 2001. Their son, Homer, was born on March 2, 2002. Laffoon filed for divorce on February 2, 2007. Heche lost custody of their son in June 2007.\nSources say Heche left her husband for \"Men in Trees\" co-star James Tupper. The couple reportedly moved in together in August 2007. On December 5, 2008, it was confirmed by Heche's representative that the actress was pregnant with Tupper's child. Their son, Atlas Heche Tupper, was born on March 8, 2009.\nFamily.\nHeche is the youngest of five, but her sister Abigail is her only surviving sibling. Her sister Cynthia died of a heart defect in infancy. Her father Donald died of AIDS aged 45 in March 1983. Her brother Nathan died in a car crash aged 18 in June 1983. Her sister, Susan Bergman, died aged 48 in January 2006. Heche and her mother, Nancy, have been estranged ever since Heche confronted her about the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her father. Since her husband's death from AIDS, Nancy Heche has been a Christian therapist and motivational speaker. She lectures on behalf of James Dobson's \"Focus on the Family\" about \"overcoming\" homosexuality.\nPsychological problems.\nOn August 19, 2000, Heche drove from Los Angeles to Cantua Creek, a rural area outside Fresno, California. She parked her Toyota SUV along a dusty roadside. Wearing only a bra and shorts, Heche walked 1\u00bd miles through the desert before knocking on the door of a stranger's ranch house. When the home's resident, Araceli Campiz, opened the door, she knew Heche from the movie \"Six Days Seven Nights\". Bemused at first, Campiz grew uneasy when Heche showed no sign of leaving. \"I didn't know what to do,\" Campiz said. \"So I called the sheriff's department.\" When deputies arrived, Heche told them that she was \"God, and was going to take everyone back to heaven in a spaceship,\" according to a police report that was aired on NBC. The deputies called an ambulance. Heche went 50 miles to Fresno's University Medical Center, from which she was released after a few hours.\nHeche says that she was insane for the first 31 years of her life. She said this was due to the trauma of being sexually abused by her father during her infancy and childhood. As a result of this trauma, Heche also says she had multiple personality disorder. She made an alter ego named \"Celestia,\" an alien from another planet who could speak to God and was the half-sister of Jesus Christ. Heche said that the incident in Cantua Creek snapped her out of her insanity and put her alter ego behind her."}

She was a principal artist of the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev. \nPavlova is most recognised for dancing the r\u00f4le of \"The Dying Swan\". She danced this short ballet (only four minutes) about 4000 times. The choreography was by Mikhail Fokine. Her interpretation influenced the way others danced Odette in Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\".\nIn the early 20th century, with her own company, Pavlova became the first ballerina to tour ballet around the world.\nTraining and style.\nThe young Pavlova's years of training were difficult, as classical ballet did not come easily to her. Her severely arched feet, thin ankles, and long limbs clashed with the small, compact body favoured for ballerinas at the time. Her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as \"The broom\" and \"La petite sauvage\" (The little savage). Undeterred, Pavlova trained to improve her technique. She took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day. She was never a perfect technician, but had delicacy, lightness and grace. Anna did not know that she would become a great dancer one day\nCareer.\nShe became \"prima ballerina\" of the Imperial Ballet in 1906. She worked briefly for Diaghilev, but would not dance in the new avant-garde ballets which were being created, such as \"The Firebird\". The role was given to the equally good Tamara Karsavina, who became their regular \"prima ballerina\".\nEngland.\nPavlova lived in London for many years, from 1912 until her death in 1931. After leaving Russia, Pavlova settled in \"Ivy House\" on North End Road, near Hampstead, where she lived for the rest of her life. While in London Pavlova taught ballet at her home. She was influential in the development of British ballet, and inspired the career of Alicia Markova. \nThe house had an ornamental lake where she would feed her pet swans, and where there is a statue of the ballerina by the Scots sculptor George Henry Paulin. It is now the London Jewish Cultural Centre but a Blue Plaque marks it as Pavlova's previous home and a site of significant historical interest.\nIn 1956 a film \"The Immortal Swan\" included footage of her dancing in the 1920s.\nShe toured Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. This was probably how the sticky Australian cake became known as the 'Pavlova'."}

At this time, the only exceptions are longtime member Detroit Mercy, 2015 arrival Northern Kentucky, and 2020 arrival Robert Morris.\nThe most recent changes in the conference membership happened in July 2020 when Purdue Fort Wayne and Robert Morris joined.\nMembers.\nCurrently, the Horizon League has 12 full members.\nFormer full members.\nA total of 14 schools have been full members, but are no longer in the league.\nNicknames are those used when the schools were conference members.\nFormer associate members.\nMany NCAA conferences have one or more \"associate\" members that play only a limited number of sports in the conference, usually one.

He won two Golden Globe Awards, including in \"Evening Shade\" for Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy and in \"Boogie Nights\" for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture.\nEarly life.\nReynolds was the son of Harriette Fernette \"Fern\" (n\u00e9e Miller; 1902\u20131992) and Douglas Burton Reynolds (1906\u20132002). He had Dutch, English, Scots-Irish and Scottish ancestry, and also claimed Cherokee and Italian roots through his father. During his career, he often claimed to have been born in Waycross, Georgia, although he said in 2015 he was actually born in Lansing, Michigan. He was born on February 11, 1936, and in his autobiography stated that Lansing is where his family lived when his father was drafted into the United States Army.\nHe, his mother, and his sister joined his father at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and lived there for two years. When his father was sent to Europe, the family moved to Lake City, Michigan, where his mother had been raised. In 1946, the family moved to Riviera Beach, Florida. His father eventually became Chief of Police of Riviera Beach, which is adjacent to the north end of West Palm Beach, Florida. During 10th grade at Palm Beach High School, Reynolds was named First Team All State and All Southern as a fullback, and received multiple scholarship offers.\nPersonal life and death.\nReynolds married Judy Carne from 1963 to 1965. He had a relationship with Dinah Shore in the early 1970s for five years. He had a relationship with Sally Field from 1977 to 1982, during which time they appeared together in four films. Reynolds married Loni Anderson from 1988 to 1993. They adopted a son, Quinton. He and Anderson separated after he fell in love with a cocktail waitress, with whom he later traded lawsuits which were settled out of court.\nHis friends included Johnny Carson, James Hampton, Dom DeLuise, Jerry Reed, Charles Nelson Reilly, Tammy Wynette, Lucie Arnaz, Adrienne Barbeau, Tawny Little, Dinah Shore, Clint Eastwood and Chris Evert.\nIn the late 1970s, Reynolds opened Burt's Place, a nightclub restaurant in the Omni International Hotel in the Hotel District of Downtown Atlanta, and briefly operated a second version at Lenox Square. He was a lifelong fan of American football, a result of his collegiate career, and was a minority owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits of the USFL from 1982 to 1986. The team's name was inspired by the Smokey and the Bandit trilogy and Skoal Bandit, a primary sponsor for the team as a result of also sponsoring Reynolds' motor racing team. Reynolds co-owned a NASCAR Winston Cup team, Mach 1 Racing, with Hal Needham, which ran the #33 \"Skoal Bandit\" car with driver Harry Gant. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Florida State University in 1981 and later endorsed the construction of a new performing arts facility in Sarasota, Florida.\nHe also owned a private \"dinner theater\" in Jupiter, Florida, with a focus on training young performers looking to enter show business. The theater was later renamed to the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theater and closed in 1997 after Reynolds declared bankruptcy. In 1984, he opened a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, \"Burt &amp; Jacks\", which he co-owned with Jack Jackson.\nWhile filming \"City Heat\", Reynolds was struck in the face with a metal chair and had temporomandibular joint dysfunction. He lost thirty pounds from not eating. The painkillers he was prescribed led to addiction, which lasted several years. He underwent back surgery in 2009 and a quintuple coronary artery bypass surgery in February 2010. On August 16, 2011, Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation filed foreclosure papers, claiming Reynolds owed US$1.2 million on his home in Hobe Sound, Florida. He owned the Burt Reynolds Ranch, where scenes for Smokey and the Bandit were filmed and which once had a petting zoo, until its sale during bankruptcy. In April 2014, the 153-acre (62 ha) rural property was rezoned for residential use and the Palm Beach County school system was empowered to sell it which they did to the residential developer K. Hovnanian Homes. Reynolds also once purchased a mansion on a tract of land in Loganville, Georgia.\nReynolds died of a heart attack on September 6, 2018."}

It is often eaten raw, but holds its shape well when baked, and is a common choice for canned or other processed pear uses.\nHistory.\nThe Williams pear is thought to date from 1765 to 1770 from the yard of an Aldermaston, England, schoolmaster named Mr. Stair or Mr. Wheeler, giving rise to the now-obscure names Aldermaston pear and Stairs pear. A nurseryman named Williams later acquired the variety, and introducing it to the rest of England, which is why the pear became known as the Williams Pear. However, the pear's full name is Williams' Bon Chretien, or \"Williams' good Christian.\" \nIn 1799 James Carter imported several Williams trees into the United States, and they were planted on the grounds of Thomas Brewer in Roxbury, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts estate was later acquired by Enoch Bartlett of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Unaware of their origin, Bartlett named the pears after himself and introduced the variety into the United States. It was not realized that Bartlett and Williams Pears were the same until 1828, when new trees arrived from Europe. By that time the Bartlett variety had become vastly popular in the United States, and they are still generally known as Bartlett pears in the U.S. and Canada, although there are about 150 other names worldwide.\nPear Tree.\nPear trees are typically in production for an average of 50 to 75 years, although some trees still produce fruit after 100 years.\nHeight: 15\u201320\u00a0ft with slightly less spread. \nFlowers: White flowers grouped in a corymb. \nBlooming Time: April - May. \nFruit &amp; Seeds: Large, golden yellow skin, brownish red blush, classic shape with smooth, white flesh. Harvest from mid-August to mid-September. But depends on which side of the earths hemisphere the plant has been placed for harvest time. \nLeaves: The leaves are simple, glossy green leaves that alternate on the twig. They grow up to 3\" long, are thick with slight midrib curves folding the edges inwards. They have fine teeth on the margin. \nElevation: 1000 - 5000 Feet. \nHabitat: Orchards and landscaping.\nProduction and uses.\nU.S. Pear production.\nIn 1985, the pear represented 80% of U.S. pear production, and in 2004, it represented 50% of reported pear production, displaced primarily by the continuing growth of d'Anjou and Bosc pears, both winter pears more tolerant of cold than the Bartlett.\n\"A Canning Tradition\".\nWhile more pears are sold fresh in the U.S. than processed, Bartlett pears are the primary choice for canned halves, puree, and most pear juice and nectar in the U.S., comprising about two thirds of Bartlett production. Bartletts are traditionally known as the canning pear due to their \"definitive flavor and sweetness,\" making them well-suited for many forms of processing.\nPoire Williams.\nThe Williams pear is used in making Poire Williams, a colourless brandy."}

In the temple, the Sikh scriptures are recited or sung, and sermons are given. Festivals are celebrated there. Sikh congregations also take part in birth, death, baptism, and marriage ceremonies in the temple. Guru Granth Sahib is usually placed at one end of the temple, high up under a canopy.\nThe Gurdwara serves many needs. It is a place where people can develop spiritual knowledge and wisdom. It is open to everyone, of every age, sex, caste, and creed. All men, women and children are treated as equals. The temple offers shelter and food to anyone in need. It offers care for the sick, elderly, and disabled. It is also a centre for promoting culture and health. In the temple, children are often taught about morality, Sikhism, and history. The Gurdwara is also a place where people can talk about problems facing the Sikh community. For example, they can talk about situations where the Sikh code of discipline was broken, and they can decide on what punishment is needed. The Gurdwara also plays a socio-economic role in the Sikh community. It is expected to be free from any sectional interests or party politics. \nA free kitchen is attached to every Gurdwara. There, the food (\"Langar\") is prepared and served. Other people and communities are allowed to visit a Gurdwara. This is one of the things that the Sikh community does to improve relations and understanding between Sikhs and other communities. These visits help satisfy others' curiosity about Sikhism. They also help visitors to better understand the Sikh religion, customs, and culture. \nA Gurdwara is marked by the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag. The four doors of a Sikh temple represent the Door of Peace, the Door of Livelihood, the Door of Learning, and the Door of Grace. These doors must always remain open to everyone.\nTemple protocol.\nIf someone wants to visit a Gurdwara, a certain protocol (or set of rules and expectations) must be followed. In Sikhism, there are strict rules against using tobacco, liquor, or narcotics. These things are not allowed in or around the Gurdwara. Before entering the hall, people take off their shoes, wash their hands, cover their head, and think of the Guru. Even non-Sikhs must cover their head with a handkerchief or scarf. After entering the hall, where Guru Granth Sahib is kept, people must walk slowly, bow humbly, and touch their foreheads to the ground, out of respect and love for the Guru. As people bow, they must place an offering (or gift) respectfully before the Guru. The offering may be money, flowers, or words of thanks. Any sincere expression of thanks is equally acceptable to the Guru. After bowing and offering, a person should sit quietly in the \"Sangat\" (congregation), without disturbing others. Usually men sit on one side and women on the other. People sit in a cross-legged position. Talking or whispering is not allowed.\nUsually, worship services in the Gurdwara follow common patterns. \"Kirtan\" is singing the holy hymns. \"Katha\" is reading, and then explaining, the hymns. \"Ardas\" is prayer. Six verses of Anand Sahib may be sung. There may also be \"Vak\" or \"Hukam\", where one random hymn from Guru Granth Sahib is read. This is the Guru's message or 'Order' of the day to the Sangat. After the Hukam is done, \"Karah Parshad\" is distributed. Then \"Langar\", food from the Guru's kitchen, is served."}

They are best known for their hit singles \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Metal Health\". The band was started in 1973 by guitar player Randy Rhoads and bass player Kelly Garni, first calling themselves Mach 1, before changing the name to Little Women and finally Quiet Riot in May 1975. The first line-up featured lead singer Kevin DuBrow, Rhoads, Garni, and drummer Drew Forsythe. The lineup now has no starting members and includes lead singer Scott Vokoun, drummer Frankie Banali, bass player Chuck Wright, and guitar player Alex Grossi. Both Banali and Wright played on the band's most successful album \"Metal Health\" era, but Wright played bass on only two songs including the hit song \"Metal Health\", but did sing backup on the whole album. \nThe band's name came from a conversation with Rick Parfitt of British band Status Quo in which Parfitt said he'd like to name a band \"Quite Right\". With his thick English accent, it sounded like he was saying \"Quiet Riot\". They are ranked at number 100 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\nHistory.\nThe 70s - The band started in the mid 70s by guitar player Randy Rhoads and bass player Kelly Garni. Lead singer Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth joined later on. They made two albums that only came out in Japan, called Quiet Riot and Quiet Riot II. Kelly Garni left after Quiet Riot II was recorded, but before the album cover was made, so the cover has his replacement, Rudy Sarzo, on the cover. Randy Rhoads left later to play with Ozzy Osbourne who was starting a solo band after being kicked out of Black Sabbath. Drew Forsyth left later. \nThe 80s - Kevin DuBrow made a new band, with drummer Frankie Banali, guitar player Carlos Cavazo and bass player Chuck Wright, although they called themselves Quiet Riot. Rudy Sarzo came back in the band to record on the band's album Metal Health. It was very successful because of the songs \"Bang Your Head\" and \"Cum On Feel The Noize\". The band brought out another album the next year called Condition Critical, although it didn't do quite as well. Kevin DuBrow started taking cocaine, and also started insulting bands similar to Quiet Riot which harmed the band's popularity. Their next album, QR III, had Chuck Wright playing bass as Rudy Sarzo left the band, and didn't do very well. Kevin DuBrow was kicked out as the band was fed up with his insults. The band's new singer was Paul Shortino and they released QR to try to become a well known band again. However, it failed in the charts and was even less successful than QR III. The band split up, but DuBrow had a court battle to own the band's name, and won.\nThe 90s - DuBrow started another new band, that went through a few brief names before being Quiet Riot again. Old members Banali and Cavazo came back, and the reformed band released Terrified and Down To The Bone. Rudy Sarzo rejoined, therefore bringing together the whole Metal Health lineup again. They released Alive And Well in 1999. The album has many re-recorded versions of older hits.\nThe 2000s - The Metal Health lineup released another album in 2001 called Guilty Pleasures, the first album by the lineup not to have any covers of other band's songs. They broke up in 2003. DuBrow and Banali started the band again the next year with Chuck Wright and new guitar player Alex Grossi. They started on a new album, but Wright and Grossi left and DuBrow and Banali had many other bass and guitar players join and leave quickly. The band's new album, Rehab, came out in 2006. Wright and Grossi rejoined to play concerts for the album.\nOn November 19th, 2007, Kevin DuBrow died of an accidental cocaine overdose, and his body was found six days later, on the 25th. Frankie Banali later said the band would never come back because of this.\nThe 2010s - although Banali said the band would not reform, they did in 2010, with new singer Mark Huff. They toured over the next year, before Huff was fired in 2012. He had to find out he was fired online. Banali hired a new singer called Scott Vokoun in March 2012. Right now, the band are celebrating the 30th anniversary of Metal Health by playing concerts around the world."}

Each player places one arm, either the right or left, on a surface, with their elbows bent and touching the surface, and they grip each other's hand. The goal is to pin the other's arm onto the surface, with the winner's arm over the loser's arm.\nDescription.\nMany things can play a part in a player's success in arm wrestling. Skill and overall arm strength are the two greatest contributing things to winning an arm wrestling match. Other things such as the length of an arm wrestler's arm, his/her muscle and arm mass/density, hand grip size, wrist endurance and flexibility, reaction time, as well as countless other traits, can add to the advantages of one arm wrestler over another. It is sometimes used to prove who is stronger between two or more people.\nSome people arm wrestle in contests. In the United States of America, contests are held by the United States Armwrestling Federation, also called the USAF. The World Armwrestling Federation, also called the WAF, has more than 85 member countries.\nAvoiding injury.\nArm wrestling puts enormous pressure/twist on the upper arm's humerus bone to a degree seen in few other physical activities. Most people's bones are not used to being so stressed in this way, and injuries can occur surprisingly easily. The arm typically fails because of a diagonal break at or below the midpoint between the shoulder and the elbow.\nThe natural tendency of an inexperienced arm wrestler is to push the hand, wrist, and shoulder in the same coordinated direction, against the force being applied by the opponent. This is how we throw a baseball or hit a tennis ball.\nHowever, turning one's shoulder this way simply adds to the pressure already being applied to the humerus by the opponent. US Arm Sports advises of the danger of \"letting your shoulder get inside your hand.\" It is better to pivot your shoulders so that you never look away from your hand.\nIf the tendons and ligaments are too weak to support the pressure, the muscles can cause a complete tendon blow (pop). However, tendons can be strengthened with many methods. When tendons are in pain, they require blood so they can heal faster. Doctors and arm wrestlers recommend doing rehabilitation training or therapy, exercising with light weights and many repetitions for 30 - 45 minutes non-stop to pump the blood into arms. Tendons can get bigger with time, though it is a very slow process. Experienced arm wrestlers can have tendons 3 to 4 times bigger than average people."}

It is considered to be a 'child' of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The difference is only in their flavouring: B\u00e9arnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorn, and tarragon, while Hollandaise uses lemon juice.\nIn appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy.\nB\u00e9arnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.\nHistory.\nAlthough a similar recipe was published in 1818, B\u00e9arnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet, the inventor of puffed potatoes (), and served at the 1836 opening of \"Le Pavillon Henri IV\", a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not far from Paris. Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was born in the former province of B\u00e9arn.\nPreparation.\nA B\u00e9arnaise sauce is simply clarified butter, an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar. It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect.\nLike Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of B\u00e9arnaise sauce. Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics. Here we highlight the differences.\nThe most common preparation is a \"Bain-marie\" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (\"sans\" lemon juice).\nMis-association.\nB\u00e9arnaise sauce is often wrongly called \"Bernaise sauce\", as if it were from \"Bern\", the capital city of Switzerland, which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins.\nSome assume B\u00e9arnaise refers to the B\u00e9arn region, a former province now in the \"d\u00e9partement\" of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, in southwestern Franceto refer to the region of B\u00e9arn However, the sauce has no tradition in the cooking of the area, and Larousse has the name honouring Henri IV of France, a native of B\u00e9arn, and for whom the restaurant where the sauce was first shown was named. Henri IV was often known as le Grand B\u00e9arnais\nA la b\u00e9arnaise.\nSome recipes are called \u00e0 la b\u00e9arnaise even when they are not accompanied by a B\u00e9arnaise sauce. This is because the recipes themselves are linked to the B\u00e9arn region. This added to confusion over the naming of the sauce."}

CAA football plays in Division I FCS (Football Championship Subdivision), the lower of two levels of NCAA Division I football. Although the CAA as a whole dates only to 1979, the football conference can trace its history to the late 1930s.\nIn 1938, five schools in New England formed the New England Conference. When one of the schools left in 1945, the other schools joined with two other New England schools to form the Yankee Conference, which began play in 1947. In 1975, the Yankee Conference dropped all sports other than football, and over time many schools outside of New England joined the league. Due to changes in NCAA rules in 1997, the Yankee Conference merged into the Atlantic 10 Conference (A10). After the CAA announced plans to start a football league in 2007, all of the A10 football teams decided to join the CAA for that sport.\nOf the full members of the CAA, Delaware, Elon, James Madison, Towson, and William &amp; Mary have football teams.

They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or \"advocaat\" filling, or with no filling at all. The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried.\nThe name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany. While most areas call it a \"Berliner\", residents of Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony know them as \"Pfannkuchen\", which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes - pancakes are known there as \"Eierkuchen\" (lit. egg cakes). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of \"Krapfen\"; in Hessen they are referred to as \"Kr\u00e4ppel\" or \"Kreppel\", or, in Palatinate, \"Fastnachtsk\u00fcchelchen\" (literally: \"little carnival cakes\").\nIn South Tirol, part of northern Italy, the food is called \"krafen\" or \"krapfen\". In Slovenia, it is \"krof\"; in Croatia \"krafne\"; in Bosnia, and Serbia \"krofne\". In Poland they are known as \"p\u0105czki\", in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called \"f\u00e1nk\". All of these are essentially identical preparations. \nIn English-speaking countries, Berliners are usually called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream. However, in South Australia, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglophone North America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is \"jelly doughnut\". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not \"set\" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream.\nThe cream or custard-filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.\nIn Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest in the U.S., such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a \"Bismarck,\" while a filled bar doughnut is called a \"Long John\", and usually contains pastry creme, custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include \"jambuster\" in Manitoba, and \"Burlington bun\" in Nova Scotia.\nBerliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (\"Silvester\") as well as the carnival holidays (Mardi Gras). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone.\nIn Portugal, berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as \"bolas de Berlim\" (Berlin ball) and the filling is always an egg-yolk- based yellow cream called \"creme pasteleiro\" (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half- length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle on it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country. \nSuch versions are also found in Latin America, in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, where it's not only filled with custard (called \"Crema pastelera\"), but with jam (especially red ones) or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called \"sonhos\" (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow cream (called simply \"creme\"). Some modern variants filled with \"doce de leite\" (a type of milk jam), or a mix of chocolate and \"doce de leite\", can be found in Rio de Janeiro's bakeries.\nIn Israel, a version of the pastry called \"sufganiyah\" is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah. While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam, many modern variants exist."}

The first-time members were the University of Central Arkansas and Eastern Kentucky University, which respectively arrived from the Southland Conference and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). Jacksonville State University, which had been an ASUN member from 1995 to 2003, returned after spending 18 years in the OVC.

The new ASUN football league, launching in 2022, will feature Austin Peay, the three 2021 arrivals, Kennesaw State, and North Alabama. Two other ASUN schools sponsor football but will not play that sport in the ASUN; Stetson plays in the Pioneer Football League, whose members do not award football scholarships, and Liberty plays as an independent in the top level of D-I football, the Football Bowl Subdivision.\nAssociate members.\nThe ASUN also has 10 \"associate members\" that play one or two sports in the conference while being full members of another conference. Five of these schools, plus full member Bellarmine, make up the ASUN men's lacrosse league, restarted in the 2021\u201322 school year (2022 season) after having been shut down when the ASUN began a lacrosse partnership with the Southern Conference (SoCon).Four more schools joined in July 2021. Two returned women's lacrosse to the ASUN after the SoCon shut down its women's volleyball league, and two joined in beach volleyball.\nThe \"Joined\" column shows the year in which a school joined the ASUN. Since all ASUN sports that have associate members (beach volleyball and men's and women's lacrosse) are spring sports, this means the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of ASUN play.

The main dispersing spores are asexual, self-mobile spores called zoospores. These do chemotaxis (movement toward, for example, a food source) in surface water. A few oomycetes produce asexual spores that are distributed by wind. Oomycetes also produce sexual spores, called oospores.

It is the single most widely distributed genus of reptiles in North America. It is famous for its resistance to the poison produced by the rough-skinned newt. Garter snakes are actually venomous, just not to humans, since the amount of toxin in their saliva is too weak to really cause damage to a human. The worst they could do to you is musk on you or bite you and leave a harmless rash. In fact, cat bites are probably more serious than garter snake bites. They prey on rodents, small fish, small birds, salamanders, earthworms (not red wigglers, as they are bad for them) insects, and insect larva. They are attracted to water sources and hiding spots. You can identify a garter snake because almost every species has a stripe running down its back, the color varying and depending on the species, as there are many different species of garter snakes. They are incredibly common animals, settling in backyards and local woods. As you read this, there is probably at least one garter slithering in the nature-filled area behind you, whatever that may be. All snakes like to hide, and garters are no exception, even if they are incredibly common and small. They hide under leaves, trees, bricks and rocks stacked up, plants, sticks, and anything they can find. If you are trying to \"catch\" a garter, look for them under these places, and you just might find them. Like most snakes, female garters tend to be longer than the males, so that's one form of sexing them. "}

It had been used many times before for other purposes.\nThe \"evolutionary tree\" shows the relationships among various biological groups. It includes data from DNA, RNA and protein analysis.\nTree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy, and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research. Below is a simplified version of present-day understanding. \nPrecursors.\nLamarck.\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744\u20131829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his \"Philosophie Zoologique\" (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex.\nHitchcock.\nThe American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1763\u20131864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his \"Elementary Geology\". On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and animal trees are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. However, they were not \"evolutionary\" trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change.\nVestiges.\nThe first edition of Robert Chambers' \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" was published anonymously in 1844. It contained a tree-like diagram in the chapter 'Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms'. It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M).\nIn the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: \"there may be branching\".p191\nDarwin's tree of life.\nCharles Darwin (1809\u20131882) was the first to produce an evolutionary tree of life. He was very cautious about the possibility of reconstructing the history of life. In \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large genus (see figure).\nIn Darwin's own words: \"Thus, the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.\"\nThis is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later.\nIn his summary to the section as revised in the 6th edition of 1872, Darwin explains his views on the Tree of Life:\nThe tree of life today.\nThe model of a tree is still considered valid for eukaryotic life forms. Research into the earliest branches of the eukaryote tree suggests a tree with either four supergroups, or two supergroups. There does not yet appear to be a consensus; in a review article, Roger and Simpson conclude that \"with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution\".\nBiologists now recognize that the prokaryotes, the bacteria and archaea have the ability to transfer genetic information between unrelated organisms through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Recombination, gene loss, duplication, and gene creation are a few of the processes by which genes can be transferred within and between bacterial and archaeal species, causing variation that is not due to vertical transfer.\nThere is emerging evidence of HGT occurring within the prokaryotes at the single and multicell level and the view is now emerging that the tree of life gives an incomplete picture of life's evolution. It was a useful tool in understanding the basic processes of evolution but cannot explain the full complexity of the situation."}

They are a clade which include not only the traditional theriodonts, but also their descendants the mammals as well (in the same way that theropod dinosaurs include the birds as a sub-clade).\nThey can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of Synapsida that lived from the Middle Permian to the Middle Cretaceous. Theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago, in the Middle Permian. Even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their relatives. \nTheriodonts fall into three main groups: Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia and Cynodontia. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic. \nTheriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids. \nEutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants \u2013 the mammals. The name means \"true beast tooth\". The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles. \nThe theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Lower Triassic. \nThe remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as \"Cynognathus\", as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts. While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed. \nBy the Upper Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent-like tritylodonts (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, trithelodonts, which evolved into the first mammals. The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous, but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth."}

He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy,\nAs a soldier he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his lieutenancy in 1784, became a colonel in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792-1794. On December 24, 1793, Frederick William married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They had ten children. In the \"Kronprinzenpalais\" (Crown Prince's palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797.\nReign.\nHe succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797 and took over personal power without giving responsibility to his ministers. Unfortunately he was not able to follow a consistent course for himself.\nHis sense of duty can be seen from this quote:\nAt first Frederick William tried to follow a policy of neutrality in the Napoleonic Wars. But in the end he entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the Battle of Jena-Auerst\u00e4dt, the French defeated the Prussian army, and it collapsed. The royal family fled to East Prussia, where Emperor Alexander I of Russia (who, rumour has it, had fallen in love with Queen Louise) helped them against Napoleon.\nBut Alexander was defeated as well. At Tilsit France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the Elbe, and had to pay for French troops that occupied Prussia.\nAlthough Frederick William himself resigned to Prussia's fate, his ministers set about a reform of Prussia's administration and military.\nAfter Napoleon's defeat in Russia (1813) Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814.\nAt the Congress of Vienna, Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia. After the war, Frederick William did not keep the promises he had made in 1813 to supply Prussia with a constitution.\nHe died on 7 June 1840. His eldest son, Frederick William IV, succeeded him."}

Deaths from world wars, especially WWI, reversed the trend, but only for a while. \nThe most significant increase in the world's population has been since the 1950s in Asia and Latin America. Medical advances, and increases in farming, have been the main causes.\nA single example is both astonishing and revealing. Since 1945, half the forests of Indonesia have been replaced with farmland. As late as 1900, Indonesia was still a densely forested country: forests covered 84 percent of the total land area. Deforestation became serious in the 1970s, and has gone faster since then. About 170 million hectares (estimated in 1900) decreased to less than 100 million hectares by the end of the 20th century. In 2008, it was estimated that tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in a decade. Of the total logging in Indonesia, up to 80% is said to be done illegally."}

It is also the county seat of Johnson County. In 2010, 125,872 people lived in Olathe. It is the fourth biggest city in Kansas. By 2018, the Census Bureau estimated 139,605 people lived in Olathe.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nOlathe was created by Dr. John T. Barton in Spring 1857. He came to the center of Johnson County, Kansas. He later told about his ride to friends: \"...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful.\" Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say \"Beautiful\" in his native language. The interpreter responded, \"Olathe.\"\nOlathe was incorporated in 1857. It was not the first city in Johnson County. Because it grew very quickly, it became the county seat in October 1859. Growing hatred across the United States about the issue of slavery led to many fights between abolitionist settlers and nearby slave state Missouri. These fights would grow, and they would become a part of the bigger fight known as Bleeding Kansas. When Kansas became a state in 1861, it was a free state. When it became a state, violence stopped. Peace, however, would continue to elude Olathe for many years to come. In 1861 Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It had one company of soldiers, and it had the local militia.\nOn September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led guerrilla Confederate soldiers in an attack against Olathe. A half dozen people died, and most of the city was destroyed. Quantrill captured the outpost, and he tried forcing the men to fight for the Confederacy. Kansas militia continued to stay in the Olathe military post for the rest of the Civil War.\nConfederate soldiers would try to attack Olathe two more times. The first time happened on August 20\u201321, 1863 as Quantrill was going through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid happened on October 24-5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price with 10,000 men went through on their retreat South (see Price's Raid).\nWhen the Confederates surrendered, the military post was ended in August 1865.\n21st century.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau said Olathe was the 24th fastest-growing city in the United States. The same year, CNN/Money and \"Money\" magazine said Olathe was #11 on its list of the \"100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.\"\nOn February 22, 2017, Adam Purinton said racial things and shot at crowded Austins Bar and Grill in southern Olathe. He shot and injured three people. One person died. The victims were Alok Madasani, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, and Ian Grillot. Purinton was later arrested in Clinton, Missouri. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. This shooting got international attention because two of the victims were Indian.\nGeography.\nThe United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water.

According to the ILO International Labour Organization the term is applied to people up to age thirteen, or seventeen in case of dangerous work. Only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention, but the age limits are generally accepted. \nWhen children work like adults, this will deprive them of their childhood: Very often, they cannot attend regular school either. This kind of work is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.\nChild labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children, like guarding other children, or helping here and there. Child labour is forbidden in most countries. In some places minor boys and girls work in tea stalls, restaurants, hotels and other small shops. Some work in huge factories like brick factories. The main reason why child labour occurs is poverty.\nThere are two kinds of work that minors can do:\nIn general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour. Estimates are that up to 350 million children are affected by child labour. Eight million of these are affected by the worst forms of child labour: they are child soldiers, they are forced into child prostitution, they are used for child pornography, they are child slaves, debt bondage or affected by human trafficking.\nOften such cases are known through scandals in the mass media. In that manner, a working child is often seen as a slave, working in a Sweet shop in a third world country, producing textiles, or as one of the street children in South America. The reality is different though: Such shops exist all over the world, also in countries like the United States or Italy. The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden: More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture, or it has to do with activities done at home, in the context of the family. If child-slaves exist, they are only a minority. This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation, the two phenomena have made it more visible. \nA"}

She followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis.\nWith Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology. As her father put it, child analysis had received a powerful impetus through \"the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud\". Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially.\nKey moments in life.\nAfter a somewhat troubled childhood, Anna was psychoanalysed by her father. When her analysis was completed in 1922, she became a psychoanalyist herself. She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis. From 1925 until 1934, she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject.\nAfter the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London. Freud himself was dying of cancer, so Anna ran the household. Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein, who had come to London much earlier, and was already established as a child psychologist. A series of 'controversial discussions' were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society. The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties. Eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools' should co-exist inside the Society. The Society now has three training divisions: Kleinian, Freudian and Independent.\nDuring the war, Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children. She set up a centre for young war victims, called \"The Hampstead War Nursery\". Here the children got foster care, with mothers \nencouraged to visit as often as possible.\nIn 1947, Freud and Kate Friedlaender established the Hampstead Child Therapy Courses. Five years later, a children's clinic was added. Freud started lecturing on child psychology.\nFrom the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family.\nFreud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in a marble shelf next to her parents' ancient Greek funeral urn. Her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there.\nPersonal life.\nAnna Freud lived with her close friend Dorothy Burlingham, daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany, for years.\nPublications.\nFreud, Anna (1966\u20131980). \"The writings of Anna Freud\": 8 Volumes.

It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes. Its fine fossils make this a lagerst\u00e4tte, a place of exceptional preservation.\nThe various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago (mya). During this period the climate moved from the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. \nThe sediments are deposited in very fine layers, in pairs: a dark layer from the growing season, and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter. \nEach pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18\u00a0mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014\u00a0mm and maximum of 9.8\u00a0mm.\nThe sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah:\nConditions at the time.\nThe formation has many evaporites \u2013 minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes. This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation.\nAnother factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes. Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition.\nClimate.\nFossils preserved suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated.\nThe Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements\nOil shale.\nThe Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world. The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 m\u00b3 (1.5 trillion US barrels) of shale oil. This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried. The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria, which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions.\nFossils.\nThe lagerst\u00e4tten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away. Leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage got during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets.\nThe fauna included fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals"}

It is a series of unrelated stories of drama, psychological thriller, fantasy, science fiction, suspense, and/or horror, often ending with a dark or unexpected twist. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to serious science fiction and abstract ideas through television and \"Twilight Zone\" books and comics.\nThe success of the first series started two revival series: one series that ran for several seasons on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, and another series that ran on UPN from 2002 to 2003. It would also lead to a movie, a radio series, a comic book, a magazine and other spin-offs that would go on for 50 years.\nAside from Serling himself, who wrote nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for \"The Twilight Zone\" included authors such as Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, Jerry Sohl, George Clayton Johnson, Earl Hamner, Jr., Reginald Rose, Harlan Ellison and Ray Bradbury. Many episodes also featured adaptations of classic stories by such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Lewis Padgett, Jerome Bixby and Damon Knight.\n\"Twilight Zone\"'s writers often used science fiction as a way for social commentary. Television networks and sponsors who had censored all possible offensive material from the mostly live dramas were not aware of the methods developed by writers such as Ray Bradbury for dealing with important issues through fantasy. Themes include nuclear war, mass hysteria, and McCarthyism, subjects that were not allowed on more \"serious\" primetime television.\nThe first series contained 156 episodes. Seasons 1, 2, 3, 5 were half hour shows. Season four (1962\u20131963) contained one-hour episodes."}

During the siege, Parisians were reduced to eating cats, dogs, and rats. The bourgeois did not want to eat such \"low\" animals, and the \"de luxe\" restaurants had plenty of customers. As food reserves dwindled, these restaurants, including Voisin, improvised. Choron served exotic animal dishes at Voisin. For the midnight Christmas meal of 1870, Choron had a menu mostly of the best parts of the animals kept in the \"Jardin d'acclimatation\" (one of the Paris zoos). The menu \u2013 stuffed head of donkey, elephant consomm\u00e9, roasted camel, kangaroo stew, bear shanks roasted in pepper sauce, wolf in deer sauce, cat with rat, and antelope in truffle sauce \u2013 has become legendary. The menu's wines were Mouton-Rothschild 1846, Roman\u00e9e-Conti 1858 and Ch\u00e2teau Palmer 1864.\nChoron became famous for his elephant dishes (): \"Trompe d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9phant in sauce chasseur\" and \"\u00c9l\u00e9phant bourguignon\". After the elephant at the \"Jardin d'acclimatation\" were used at the Christmas table, the two elephants (Castor and Pollux) at the Paris' \"jardin zoologique\" were consumed on 31 December 1870 at Voisin. In early January, it was the elephant at the \"Jardin des Plantes\" (Paris' botanical garden) which was sent to the abbatoir. It was bought by Choron for his restaurant at the price of 15 francs per pound. By 13 January Voisin was out of elephant meat and substituted horse. The siege was lifted two weeks later."}

Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source.\nTypically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.\nThe smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching.\nWhen a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures.\nAlternatives.\nA contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric \"dry-heat\" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.\nElectric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or \"bath\"), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam.\nOrigin.\nBains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated.\nThe name comes from the medieval-Latin term \"balneum\" (or \"balineum\") \"Mariae\"\u2014literally, \"Mary's bath\"\u2014from which the French \"bain de Marie\", or \"bain-marie\", is derived. There are many theories as to how the name \"Marie\" came to be associated with this equipment:"}

It was measured at 8.4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale The earthquake happened off Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, on the east coast of the T\u014dhoku of Japan, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC. It was at a depth of 24.4\u00a0km (15.2\u00a0miles). It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history. It was also the fourth most powerful earthquake on Earth since modern record-keeping began in 1900.\nOn 10 February 2015, the Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing.\nEarthquake.\nDays before the main earthquake, there were several foreshocks. The biggest one was a 7.2\u00a0magnitude earthquake on 9\u00a0March, about from the main earthquake's location.\nThe United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was from Tokyo. A 7.7 aftershock happened 30\u00a0minutes following the first quake. There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 4.5 or more.\nThe earthquake damaged buildings and started fires. The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake. Various train services around Japan were also stopped. Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami, affecting many people. A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara, Chiba prefecture.\nThe nuclear power plants shut down automatically. At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked. About 51,000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed. There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown.\nTsunami.\nThe earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japan's Pacific coast and other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands (USA) and Taiwan. The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale. It warned that the wave could be as much as 10\u00a0meters high. A 0.5\u00a0meter high wave hit Japan's northern coast. Kyodo news agency reported a four-metre-high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Miyagi Prefecture was flooded, with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland. In some areas the waves reached 10\u00a0km inland.\nAt 9:28 p.m (HST) the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7\u00a0a.m. for all of Hawaii. Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 2:59\u00a0am local time. A wave two meters high reached California, after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500\u00a0kilometres per hour. A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave.\nEffects.\nDeaths\u2013Injured\u2013Missing.\nThe Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing across 18 prefectures, as well as over 126,000 buildings damaged or destroyed.\nNuclear disaster.\nThe Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011, just hours after the initial wave. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped. The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved.\nThere were 4.4 million households that had their electricity supply cut off, including 11 nuclear power plants.\nGeophysical impact.\nThe quake moved parts of northeast Japan as much as closer to North America, making parts of Japan's land \"wider than before,\" according to geophysicist Ross Stein. Areas of Japan closest to the epi-center shifted the most.\nThe Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to . Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as , covering an area some long by wide. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake.\nAccording to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass.\nThe axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude.\nTransport.\nThe T\u014dhoku Expressway, which serves northern Japan, had to be closed due to cracks on the roads. The whole railway network was closed, but was reopened hours after the earthquake. Up to 100,000 people were stuck waiting for a ride straight out of the city.\nTelevision broadcast.\nIn response to the great disaster, Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast. This was the first time any emperor had used television in this way.\nOther help.\nThere were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster. For example, Google set up a people finder service, which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people.\nReferences.\nWikinews has news related to:"}

{"id": "286359", "revid": "1153456", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286359", "title": "Operation (mathematics)", "text": "In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes one or more inputs (called operands) and produces an output. Some of the most common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all of which take two inputs and produce an output. These are called binary operations, and are often used when solving math problems. Other types of operations are called unary operations, which take only one input and produce an output. \nThere are more operations than these, including raising numbers to exponents, taking the root and applying the logarithm.\nBelow is a list of the most used operations.\nList of mathematical operations.\nAddition.\nAddition is the first arithmetic operation and hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of subtraction. The terms in an addition are called \"addends\", and the result of an addition is called a \"sum\".\nThe symbol for addition is +\nExamples of additions:\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nformula_4\nformula_5\nAny number plus zero is the same number (formula_6). This is called the \"additive identity\".\nFor example: formula_7\nChanging the order of the addends in an addition does not change its sum. This is called the \"commutative property of addition\".\nFor example: formula_8\nChanging how addends are grouped in an addition does not change its sum either. This is called the \"associative property of addition\".\nFor example: formula_9\nAdditive inverses (opposites).\nThe opposite of a number formula_10 is formula_11. A number formula_10 plus its opposite formula_11 is always equal to 0: formula_14\nFor example, the opposite of 5 is -5, because formula_15\nThe absolute value of two opposite numbers is always the same.\nSubtraction.\nSubtraction is the second arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of addition. The number that is being subtracted is the \"subtrahend\" and the number it is subtracted from is the \"minuend\". The result of a subtraction is called a \"difference\".\nThe symbol for subtraction is \u2212\nExamples of subtractions:\nformula_16\nformula_17\nformula_18\nformula_19\nformula_20\nformula_21\nBecause of the \"additive identity\", any number minus zero is the same number (formula_22).\nIn a subtraction of two terms, switching the minuend and the subtrahend changes the sign of the answer, meaning subtraction is anticommutative.\nFor example: formula_23 and formula_24\nMultiplication.\nMultiplication is the third arithmetic operation and the second hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of division. The terms in a multiplication are called \"factors\", and the result of a multiplication is called a \"product\".\nMultiplication is repeated addition.\nThe symbol for multiplication is \u00d7 (\u2022 in algebra)\nExamples of multiplications:\nformula_25\nformula_26\nformula_27\nformula_28\nformula_29\nAny number times one is the same number (formula_30). This is called the \"multiplicative identity\".\nFor example: formula_31\nChanging the order of the factors in a multiplication does not change its product. This is called the \"commutative property of multiplication\".\nFor example: formula_32\nChanging how factors are grouped in a multiplication does not change its product either. This is called the \"associative property of multiplication\".\nFor example: formula_33\nMultiplicative inverses (reciprocals).\nThe reciprocal of a number formula_34 is formula_35. A number formula_34 times its reciprocal formula_35 is always equal to 1: formula_38\nFor example, the reciprocal of 3 is 1/3, because formula_39\nTo get the reciprocal of a fraction, switch the numerator and the denominator: the reciprocal of formula_40 is formula_41\nDivision.\nDivision is the fourth arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of multiplication. The number that is being divided is the \"dividend\" and the number it is divided by is the \"divisor\". The number on top of a fraction is called the \"numerator\" and the number at the bottom is called the \"denominator\". The result of a division is called a \"quotient\".\nDivision is repeated subtraction.\nThe symbol for division is / or a fraction.\nExamples of divisions:\nformula_42\nformula_43\nformula_44\nformula_45\nformula_46\nBecause of the \"multiplicative identity\", any number divided by one is the same number (formula_47).\nDivision by zero is undefined (formula_48).\nIn a fraction, switching the numerator and the denominator gives the reciprocal of the fraction.\nFor example: formula_49\nExponentiation.\nExponentiation is the fifth arithmetic operation and the third hyperoperation. It is one of the inverse operations of roots and logarithms. The number that is being multiplied is the \"base\" and the number of times it is multiplied is the \"exponent\". The result of an exponentiation is called a \"power\".\nExponentiation is repeated multiplication or division.\nThe symbol for exponentiation is the superscript (xy) or the caret (^).\nExamples of exponentiations:\nformula_50\nformula_51\nformula_52\nformula_53\nformula_54\nformula_55\nBecause of the \"multiplicative identity\", the first power of any number is the same number, and the zeroth power of any number is one (formula_56 and formula_57).\nRoots.\nRoots are the sixth arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and logarithms. The first term is called the \"index\", and the second term is called the \"radicand\". The result of a root is called a \"base\". When there is no index, this means it is a square (2) root.\nThe symbol for roots is the radical (formula_58).\nExamples of roots:\nformula_59\nformula_60\nformula_61\nformula_62\nformula_63\nThe first root of any number is the same number (formula_64).\nLogarithms.\nLogarithms are the seventh arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and roots. The first term is called the \"base\", and the second term is called the \"power\". The result of a logarithm is called an \"exponent\". When there is no base, this means it is a base 10 logarithm.\nThe symbol for logarithm is logb(a)\nExamples of logarithms:\nformula_65\nformula_66\nformula_67\nformula_68\nformula_69\nThe logarithm of 1 (formula_70) is 0 in every base. This is because formula_71\nThe logarithm base e, or natural logarithm, is written as formula_72.\nModulation.\nModulation is the eighth arithmetic operation. It gives the remainder of a division. The first term is called the \"modulend\" and the second term is called the \"modulator\". The result of a modulation is called a \"modulus\".\nThe symbol for modulation is \\\nExamples of modulations:\nformula_73\\formula_74\nformula_75\\formula_76\nformula_77\\formula_78\nformula_79\\formula_80\nformula_81\\formula_82\nformula_77\\formula_34 is always equal to zero, because zero can be divided by any number (formula_85).\nFactorial.\nFactorial is a function which gives the number of ways to arrange formula_10 objects. The term is called the \"index\". The result of a factorial is also called a factorial.\nThe symbol for factorial is !\nThe first factorials are:\nformula_87\nformula_88\nformula_89\nformula_90\nformula_91\nformula_92\nformula_93 is equal to one because there is exactly one way of arranging 0 objects. Factorials are undefined for negative numbers. Factorials of fractional numbers can be calculated using the Gamma function.\nAbsolute value.\nAbsolute value is a function which gives the distance from zero (or magnitude) of a number.\nThe symbol for absolute value is formula_94\nExamples of absolute values:\nformula_95\nformula_96\nformula_97\nformula_98\nformula_99\nThe absolute value of formula_100 is the same as the absolute value of formula_101 (formula_102). This is because subtraction is anticommutative."}

Fukushima Daiichi was the first nuclear power plant to be built and run only by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).\nIn March 2011 there were nuclear emergencies at the power plant and some other Japanese nuclear facilities, which raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.\nThe nuclear reactors.\nThe nuclear reactors for units 1, 2, and 6 were supplied by General Electric, those for units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and unit 4 by Hitachi. The architectural design for the General Electric's units was done by Ebasco. All of the building work was done by Kajima. Since September 2010, unit 3 has been fueled by MOX fuel|mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Units 1\u20135 had/have a Mark 1 type (light bulb shaped torus) containment structure, unit 6 has Mark 2 type (over/under) containment structure.\nUnit 1 is a 439\u00a0MW boiling water reactor (BWR3) constructed in July 1967. It started to commercially make electricity on March 26, 1971, and was planned to shutdown in March, 2011. It was damaged during the 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami. The reactor had high atomic and earthquake safety levels when it was made, but it is now both old and out of date. No one knew such a bad earthquake could happen in Japan. Unit 1 was designed for a earthquake \"peak ground acceleration\" shaking motion of 0.18\u00a0g (1.74\u00a0m/s2) and a seismic \"response spectrum\" based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the seismic \"ground acceleration\" was 0.125\u00a0g (1.22\u00a0m/s2) for 30\u00a0seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered.\n2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.\nIn March 2011, soon after the Sendai earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese government cleared people from around the plant and started local emergency laws at Fukushima I. Ryohei Shiomi of Japan's nuclear safety board was worried about the chance of a meltdown at Unit 1. The next day, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yukio Edano said that a partial meltdown at Unit 3 was \"highly possible.\"\nThe Nuclear Engineering International group had reported that Units 1, 2 and 3 were automatically shut down. Units 4, 5 and 6 had already been shut down for maintenance. Back-up generators were damaged by the tsunami; started at first, but stopped after 1 hour later.\nJapan\u2019s government said it had and a nuclear emergency when the cooling problems happened as the back-up diesel generators broke down. The cooling is needed to remove decay heat even when a plant has been shut down, due to the long term atomic reactions. Hundreds of Japanese troops were said to be trucking generators and batteries to the site.\nReactor and generators damage reports (09.53 UTC, 16-3-2011).\nAfter the back-up diesel generators pumps broke down, emergency batteries ran low after about eight hours. Batteries from other nuclear plants were sent to the site and mobile electric and diesel generators arrived within 13 hours, but work to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps was still continuing as of 15:04 on 12 March. The diesel generators would normally be connected by switching gears in a basement area of the power station's buildings, but this had been flooded by the tsunami.\nData estimated by JAIF (Japan Atomic Industrial Forum).\nLater, unit 4 at the nearby Fukushima II Nuclear Power Station was also shut down by the safety systems. Now, a source of off-site power is available but the damage level at the plant is bad.\nProposed long term safety activity.\nBoron.\nOfficials have thought about putting in or aerial dropping radiation killing boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the spent fuel pools to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011. Neutron are absorbed by boric acid, which has been injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was also included with the hose and fire truck water spraying of SFPs.\nA 'Sarcophagus tomb' and liquid metal.\nOn 18 March, the Reuters news agency reported that Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman of Japan's nuclear agency was asked about burying the reactors in a sand and concrete tomb, said: \"That solution is in the back of our minds, but we are focused on cooling the reactors down.\"\nAfter the Chernobyl disaster, the atomic safety workmen used 1,800 metric tonnes of sand and clay cover the plant. This created a problem because they were thermal insulators and trapped heat inside. So first a non-evaporating coolant such as a liquid metal has to be put on it. After it has all cooled off a structure such as the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant 'sarcophagus tomb'.\nImplications.\nThe nuclear emergencies at Fukushima Daiichi and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Platts has said that \"the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world\". Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."}

There is also more competition in California. Since he moved there, he has competed in Brazil, China and Switzerland. For him, skateboarding is not just a sport; it is a kind of art. It is a way of expressing himself, being original and unique. It is not a traditional sport where everybody executes the same tricks. A skateboarder needs to develop a unique style almost like an artist.\nPierre-Luc Gagnon said that skateboarding helps kids to use their imagination for trying new things. He fell in love with skateboarding when he started and he never stops. He started to go to the skate park each day after school at the age of nine, and now he practices it six days a week three hours by day."}

Set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, the movie is known for its graphic portrayal of war and for the intensity of its second scene of 24 minutes, a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy landings. The movie follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of a family of four, with his three other brothers having been killed in action.\nIn 1996, producer Mark Gordon pitched Rodat's idea, which was inspired by the Niland brothers, to Paramount, which eventually began development on the project. Spielberg, who at the time was forming DreamWorks, came on board to direct the project, and Hanks joined the cast. After the cast went through training supervised by Marine veteran Dale Dye, the movie's photography started in June 1997 and lasted two months. The movie's D-Day scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland and used members of the Irish Army as infantry for the D-Day landing.\nReleased on July 24, 1998, \"Saving Private Ryan\" received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances (particularly from Hanks), realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's direction, and was placed on many movie critics' 1998 top ten lists. It was also a box office success, becoming the highest-grossing movie of 1998 in the United States with $216.8 million domestically and the second-highest-grossing movie of 1998 worldwide with $481.8 million worldwide. Additionally, it grossed $44 million from its release on home video in May 1999. The movie won several accolades, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Golden Globes, Producers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, and Critics' Choice Awards. The movie was nominated for eleven Academy Awards at the 71st Academy Awards, where it won five: Best Director (Spielberg's second), Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though it lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to \"Shakespeare in Love\" in a controversial Oscars upset.\nSince its release, \"Saving Private Ryan\" has been considered one of the greatest war movies of all time and has been lauded as influential on the war movie genre. It is credited for renewing interest in World War II media. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked \"Saving Private Ryan\" as the 71st-greatest American movie in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and in 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress."}

He played college football for Louisiana Tech. As of the start of the 2009 NFL season, he was the third most accurate kicker in the history of the National Football League. He is of Greek origin and is Christian. He has spent time with the New York Giants, the Cleveland Browns, and the Baltimore Ravens, where he played for 13 seasons. He was signed by the Indianapolis Colts in October 2009 to replace injured kicker Adam Vinatieri. His signature celebration had his thumbs and pointer fingers pointed outward with his arms halfway or all the way in the air.\nEarly years.\nStover attended Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas (Class of 1986), the alma mater of fellow NFL placekicker Phil Dawson (Cleveland Browns). Stover won All-District honors as both a wide receiver and kicker. During the 1985-86 LHHS season he kicked a 53-yard field goal.\nCollege career.\nStover attended Louisiana Tech University. He graduated with a degree in marketing. During his college career, Stover made 64 of 88 field goal attempts. As a sophomore, facing Texas A&amp;M, he kicked a 57-yard field goal, then a school record. He also punted as a senior, punting 36 times for 1,277 yards (34.1 yards per punt avg). He left Louisiana Tech with 262 career total points and seven field goals of 50 yards or more. Stover would sometimes kick the ball through the goal posts on the first kick-off of the game.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nStover was drafted by the New York Giants with the 329th selection (12th round) in the 1990 NFL Draft. He was on the injured reserve list the entire season as the Giants won Super Bowl XXV.\nCleveland Browns.\nStover signed with the Cleveland Browns in 1991 and spent five seasons as a Brown.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nIn 1996 the Browns moved to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens. Stover spent the majority of his career as a Raven. In 2000, the Ravens failed to score an offensive touchdown in five straight games, in which Stover, who was selected as a Pro Bowler, scored all the team's points. Stover received a Super Bowl ring that year when the Ravens defeated his former team, the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV.\nStover kept kicking for the Ravens, setting records and kicking 18 late game-winning field goals. \nIn 2003, an overtime field goal of just over 40 yards from Stover beat the Seattle Seahawks in a 44-41 shootout. In 2007, a 43-yard kick from Stover beat the Arizona Cardinals in overtime. \nIn 2008, Stover booted a 43-yard field goal to win against the Tennessee Titans in the AFC Divisional Round. That was Stover's last field goal as a Raven. The Ravens decided not to re-sign Stover following the 2008 season.\nOn Nov 20, 2011, Stover was inducted into the Ravens Ring of Honor, during a half-time ceremony at M&amp;T Bank Stadium against the Cincinnati Bengals \nIndianapolis Colts.\nAs a free agent Stover signed with the Indianapolis Colts during the 2009 NFL season to replace the injured Adam Vinatieri. In Indianapolis, Stover played in two wins against the Ravens, and helped the Colts to an appearance in Super Bowl XLIV, at age 42, an NFL record. He missed an important 52-yard kick in the game against the New Orleans Saints and was not re-signed.\nRetirement.\nStover announced his retirement from football on May 25, 2011 with the Baltimore Ravens. At the time of his retirement, he was the last remaining member of the original Cleveland Browns still active in the NFL, and was also the last Raven to have played for the franchise before the move. He retired as the NFL's fourth all-time leading scorer."}

He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia. He was leader of six of these expeditions. He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer. On each trip, he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey. In 1862, he crossed Australia from Adelaide, South Australia, to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory. He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again.\nExploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi. He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance. Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back. Stuart's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle. His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java. This meant that for the first time, Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world. But his personal rewards were small. He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers. Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50.\nEarly life.\nStuart was born on 7 September 1815, at Dysart, Fife, Scotland. His father, William Stuart, had been a captain in the British Army. His mother was Mary McDouall. They had nine children, John McDouall was the sixth. His parents died when he was ten years old. The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives. Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh. He studied to be an engineer and surveyor.\nAustralia.\nIn 1839, Stuart moved to Adelaide, South Australia, and began work as a surveyor. Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city. The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased. Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas, measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks. He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush. He was known as a heavy drinker, often spending days at a time drunk. When a recession hit the South Australian economy, Stuart found himself without a job.\nCentral Australian Expedition 1844.\nStuart joined Charles Sturt's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844. Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia, that he took a large boat as part of his equipment. Stuart joined the group as a draftsman, who would draw up the maps. He was paid one pound a week, and provided with food. Stuart and James Poole, the second in command, were sent out ahead of the main group to find water. The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk. Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen, near the current site of Milparinka.\nIn the hot dry climate of summer, the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months. Stuart took a small group to find water to the north, west, and east, but found none. Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen. It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool. All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out. They had headaches, their noses bled, and their skin began to turn black. When Poole died, Stuart was made second in command. He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly. When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert. They turned south and went back to the Darling River. Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group. They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling. Sturt had to be carried in a cart, and Stuart, crippled with scurvy and beriberi, looked like a skeleton.\nIt took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition. He wrote in a letter: \"I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months, and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months.\" For the next few years he was unable to work. The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses. In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm. He soon found work surveying in the area, and met William Finke and James Chambers. Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Stuart to explore for them. They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water, as well as minerals like gold and copper.\n1858 expedition.\nStuart learned from his trip with Sturt that large groups were not able to move quickly through the dry Australian lands. He believed that a small group would have more success. Finke paid him to find out if the land north of Lake Torrens would be suitable for sheep. On this first trip he went with two men, Forster and an unnamed Aboriginal youth. They took six horses, enough food for six weeks, a watch and a compass. In May 1858 they went through settled areas until they reached Oratunga Station, one of the most remote farms in South Australia. It is near the present day town of Blinman, in the north of the Flinders Ranges. From here they went northwest and found a permanent water hole, Andamooka Waterhole, on a creek Stuart named Chambers Creek. It has since been renamed Stuart Creek. The country was very dry, and they could only find water in Aboriginal wells. The stony ground hurt the horses feet. At the end of July they reached the site of the present day town of Coober Pedy. Their horses were in poor condition and they were running out of food. Stuart decided to change direction to the south west and try and reach the coast near Fowlers Bay. The Aboriginal youth would not go any further and went back. He was scared of other Aborigines in the area they were going into. Stuart said the land was \"...dreary, dismal, dreadful desert.\" Stuart and Forster reached the coast at Denial Bay in August 1858, and were back in settled farm lands by 11 September. They had completed a journey of in four months. He gave his diary and maps to the South Australian government. As a reward, Stuart was given the lease to 1,000 square miles of land at Chambers Creek.\nStuart's second expedition 1859.\nThe official South Australian government explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage followed Stuart's maps and went to Chambers Creek. He reported that the map showed the creek was marked too far to the north. Stuart went back to Chambers Creek to survey the area again. This expedition was paid for by James Chambers and William Finke who realized the value of reliable water supplies on the other side of the salt lakes. Stuart left Oratunga Station on 2 April 1859, with a small group, three men and 14 horses. The men he took with him included a Bavarian naturalist and artist, David Herrgott, and Louis M\u00fcller, a stockman and botanist. Both Herrgott and M\u00fcller had been gold miners in Victoria, and would know how to look for gold in the country around Chambers Creek. They did not carry much equipment, only a blanket to sleep with, but no tents. The only food they took was flour, dried beef (jerky), tea, sugar and tobacco. He took more equipment than just his watch and compass on this trip; a sextant, a copy of the Astronomical Almanac and a telescope.\nStuart went a different way to Chambers Creek, going through a gap in between the salt lakes that had been explored by Major Peter Warburton earlier in the year. Herrgott found a group of 12 artesian springs, which Stuart named after him. This name later became the settlement of Herggott Springs. The name was changed again during World War One because of strong anti-German feelings in Australia. The town is now called Marree after the Aboriginal word for possum. These springs were mound springs; over thousands of years the salt in the water had formed small hills, and the water came out of them like water out of a volcano. Some of the mounds were over high. They were valuable because they provided reliable water for people and animals moving north to Chambers Creek.\nAfter surveying Chambers Creek again, Stuart explored the area to the north west of Chambers Creek. They found more mound springs which Stuart named Elizabeth Springs after one of Chamber's daughters. They continued north west and searched for gold in the Davenport Range. They found more springs which they named the Spring of Hope. They were able to continue and found more springs, which Stuart named Freeling Springs, after Major Freeling, a South Australian politician. By the time they had passed the current site of Oodnadatta, both the men and the horses were suffering from the lack of water and proper food. The horses' shoes had worn out in the rocks around the Davenport Range. On 12 June 1859, Stuart turned around and went back. They rode south back to Port Augusta and then took a boat back to Adelaide.\nThird expedition 1859.\nThe South Australian government offered a prize of \u00a32,000 to the first person to cross Australia from the south to the north. They hoped this would be a route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line that would connect Australia to the line that came from Europe. Stuart and Chambers plans for the trip were not accepted by the government. The government sent Alexander Tolmer to lead the trip. His expedition did not make it out of the settled areas. In August 1859, one month after his last trip, Stuart went back to do more surveying for Chambers at Chambers Creek. With William Darton Kekwick and two other men, they took 12 horses and explored the west side of Lake Eyre. Chambers and Stuart believed that the lake might hold water. Instead Stuart found mud after he walked several kilometres into the dry salt lake. He found another artesian mound spring, more than in height, which he named William Springs, after one of Chamber's sons. He then set off for the Spring of Hope. He saw grasslands and eventually made a base at Freeling Springs. He explored much of the surrounding area hoping to find gold. On 6 January 1860, with his food supplies getting low, and two of the men refusing to go any further, Stuart once again returned home.\nFourth expedition September 1860.\nThere was a lot of support for an expedition to cross Australia. In Melbourne, the biggest exploring expedition in Australian history, the Victorian Exploring Expedition, was being organized for the crossing. This became known as the Burke and Wills expedition, named after its two leaders, Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. Stuart knew that he would be able to travel further and faster by only going with a small group. In March 1860, with Kekwick, Benjamin Head and 13 horses, Stuart left Chambers Creek and headed north. They were the first Europeans to enter central Australia. They reached the Finke River, the MacDonnell Ranges, and the strange rock formation Stuart called Chambers Pillar. On 23 April, Stuart worked out that they were at the very centre of Australia. He named a small hill near the spot Mount Sturt, after Charles Sturt. Stuart and Kekwick climbed the hill and raised the British flag. Stuart wrote that the flag would be a sign to the Aborigines \"...that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and Christianity is about to break upon them.\" The name was later changed to Central Mount Stuart. From here Stuart tried to go northwest to reach the Victoria River. This took them into the Tanami Desert, but they could not find water and were forced to go back.\nThey continued to travel north, beyond the site of the town of Tennant Creek. On 26 June they reached a creek, now called Attack Creek, about north of Adelaide. A large group of Aborigines from a group called the Warramunga, attacked the explorers. The Warrumunga threw boomerangs at the explorers, and then set fire to the grass. Stuart and his men fired their guns at the Warrumunga, but Stuart does not say in his diary if any were killed or injured. The men quickly left the creek and went south.\nStuart decided they could not get any further north because they were running out of food, water was scarce and the horses were in poor condition. He wrote \"...I think it would be madness and folly to attempt more.\" The return journey was very difficult. Stuart could only ride for a few hours a day; on one day he just dug a hole in the sand and curled up in it. Head was so hungry he stole food, which left them with even less. Their clothes were only torn rags and their bodies were covered in bruises caused by scurvy. Stuart wrote in his diary that \"My men have now lost all their former energy...and move about as if they were a hundred years old. It is sad to see them...\" Stuart wrote in his diary that sores on his hands had made them to painful to be used and he could only just sit in the saddle. He gums had become so sore and his teeth so loose that he could only eat flour boiled in water. He wrote on 16 May that \"...I almost wished that death would come and relieve me from my fearful torture...\" The medicines he had with him did not help.\nThe explorers made their way back to Adelaide as Burke and Wills were starting their journey north from Melbourne. Stuart was treated as a hero when he arrived in Adelaide. In 1859 the Royal Geographical Society in London presented him with gold watch. This was given to the explorer Count Paul Strzelecki to take back to Australia.\nThe cost of Stuart's exploring had been paid for by Chambers. Because of this, Stuart would not make his journals and maps available to the public. This led to claims that Stuart had not really travelled that far north and that he was lying about his discoveries. In Victoria it was even said that Stuart had not really gone north, but had been hiding in a cellar in Adelaide.\nFifth expedition 1861.\nThe public and the newspapers began to talk about a race across the continent of Australia. Could Stuart, experienced and used to moving quickly, beat the better equipped, but very slow moving Burke and Wills expedition. After their failures with Babbage and Tolmer's expeditions, the South Australian government now believed that Stuart would succeed if he had enough support. They gave \u00a32,500 to set up another expedition and provided ten armed men to protect Stuart from any more attacks by the Aborigines. Chambers agreed to supply more horses and to pay Stuart and Kekwick's wages. In Victoria, a policeman was sent off to tell Burke to get going to the Gulf of Carpentaria as fast as possible, but Burke had already heard about Stuart's planned trip. Burke divided his group in two, and leaving most of his supplies behind at Menindee on the Darling River, he headed north to Cooper Creek.\nOn 1 January 1861, Stuart with a group of 12 men and 49 horses set off from Chambers Creek. The hot weather made it hard to find water and many waterholes from his earlier trips were dry. In February Stuart sent back two men with five horses. They reached the northern border of South Australia at about the same time that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was able to travel 240\u00a0km north of Attack Creek, where he found a large waterhole he called Glandfield Lagoon, after the mayor of Adelaide. Chambers later changed the name on Stuart's maps to Newcastle Waters, after the Duke of Newcastle, a British politician. From here Stuart again looked for a way to go north west to the Victoria River, but he was unable to find water. With the food running out, the men becoming sick, and horses in poor condition, Stuart again decided to return to Adelaide. Burke and Wills had not returned to Cooper Creek and were missing.\nStuart was presented with the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal for 1861.\nSixth expedition 1861\u201362.\nStuart set out on his third attempt to cross Australia on 25 October 1861. This expedition was called the Great Northern Exploring Expedition. The group was: John McDouall Stuart, William Darton Kekwick, Francis William Thring, William Patrick Auld, Stephen King Jnr., John William Billiatt, James Frew Jnr., Heath Nash, John Woodforde, John McGorrery and Frederick George Waterhouse.\nMcGorrey was a blacksmith who would be able to fix the shoes on the group's 78 horses. Waterhouse was a naturalist who would be able to keep a scientific notes of their discoveries. Stuart was injured when a horse stood on his right hand, and remained behind for a month to recover. He learned about the deaths of Burke and Wills at Cooper Creek.\nThe group left Chambers Creek on 8 January 1862 moving fast, covering between 30 and 50 kilometres a day. The fast pace meant that in the first three weeks eight horses died and Woodforde left and went back. Stuart left some of the supplies behind and cut the amount each man was allowed to eat. At Mount Hay in central Australia, they were again attacked by Aboriginal warriors, but they were no match for the group's guns and several may have been killed.\nThey reached Newcastle Waters in three months, and then took a week to rest. Stuart spent the next five weeks searching for water. He finally found a series of waterholes, creeks and rivers which meant the whole group were able to continue to the north. He gave up trying to reach the Victoria River. When they got to the Roper River, which had been explored by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, he knew he could easily go west to the Gulf of Carpentaria, but instead chose to continue north. Auld later said that \"...the mosquitos and flies were terrible. Our hands, feet and necks were blistered with their bites.\" They crossed Arnhem Land, and made the way along the edge of what is now Kakadu National Park. He followed the Adelaide River, but when the ground became too soft and muddy, they went further north to the Mary River and eventually reached the sea.\nThey arrived at Van Diemen's Gulf on 24 July 1862. On a tall tree branch they raised a Union Jack flag with Stuart's name embroided on it which had been made by Chamber's daughter, Elizabeth. Wood from the tree, which has since been destroyed, is in the collection of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia's collection. The group then had to travel back to Adelaide. Food was becoming scarce, and the hot weather meant there was little water. Many horses died, and Stuart was again forced to leave behind equipment. Waterhouse had to leave all his carefully collected plants and animals. The men were very hungry and even shot and ate dingos. Stuart was in poor health and became blind. He was unable to speak for several days and the men thought he was going to die. He was unable to ride his horse, and they made a bed with long poles and blankets that could be carried between two horses. Stuart was carried by this method. after crossing the MacDonnell Ranges, they discovered that rain had fallen and there was lots of grass. On reaching the settled areas, Stuart learned that his friend and partner, James Chambers had died. He left Kekwick in charge of the group, and went ahead with Auld. They got on the train at Kapunda and arrived in Adelaide on 17 December 1862.\nStuart and his group were given a special welcome in Adelaide on 16 January 1863. They dressed in their old clothes and rode into the city as heroes. This was also the day that Burke and Wills were buried in Melbourne after the failure of their expedition.\nLater life.\nStuart was in poor health, almost blind, and had a crippled right hand after the sixth trip. With Chambers dead, he no longer had a job. The government tried not to pay him the \u00a32,000 reward, saying that they had paid for the cost of the expedition. After public pressure, they gave in, but invested the money and only gave Stuart a small amount each year. He was drinking a lot of alcohol and none of his friends would give him any help. The government then wanted \u00a3500 for the lease of the land they had given him at Chambers Creek. Stuart sold it to James Chambers' brother, John Chambers, for only \u00a3200, losing money on the deal.\nHe decided to return to Great Britain in April 1864. He lived with his sister Mary in Glasgow, Scotland. The Royal Geographical Society asked the South Australian government for a pension for Stuart, but they said he had been rewarded enough with grants of land. During the debate over the pension it was said that it was not the exploring that had ruined his health, but his drinking habits. He suffered from dementia, and it is possible he also had tuberculosis. He died in London on 5 June 1866 from a stroke and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery. Only seven people went to the funeral, four relatives, two members of the Royal Geographical Society, and Alexander Hay, a South Australian farmer who was in London at the time. The grave was damaged in World War II, but was repaired in 2011 by the Stuart Society and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia.\nThe Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built along the route taken by Stuart. Using his notes they were easily able to find water supplies and trees to make the poles. The accuracy of his maps made building the line much easier. His journey is remembered in the Stuart Highway, one of Australia's major roads which joins Port Augusta to Darwin. It follows much of the same route discovered by Stuart. In June 1904, a statue of Stuart was put up in Adelaide. The Royal Geographical Society of South Australia has a wooden chair and table made by Stuart in 1854.\nBenjamin Head later said about Stuart \"...that he was a born leader of men: the sharpest little fellow you would find in a year's march.\"\nConclusion.\nStuart and A.C. Gregory were arguably Australia\u2019s greatest inland explorers. The latter was certainly financed and equipped much better than Stuart who had to rely on Chambers and Finke\u2019s support rather than the State Government. It may very well have been possible for Stuart to reach the north coast earlier if he had the Government support that Gregory, Babbage and Tolmer were granted. That said, he didn\u2019t and was totally driven to reach the north coast despite illness and afflictions that arguably he had since arriving in South Australia and were to see him die at such an early age in England in 1866. The key attributes that made Stuart one, if not the best inland explorer, include: \n- He had exceptional dead reckoning and navigational skills that enabled him to understand exactly where he was. \n- He spent more time in the field and explored more land than any other explorer without the loss of a man. \n-He learnt from every trip how far to push the physical limits and when to turn back.\n- He understood and cared for his horses and knew their limits and ability to move quickly through land and how far each type could survive without water. - He was courageous, a great leader and his concern and respect for his fellow expedition members was reciprocated."}

It lived in the late Carboniferous period, 306 million years ago. \nIt was found in Nova Scotia, at the same locality as \"Hylonomus\", and \"Petrolacosaurus\", which are similar to \"Archaeothyris\", but probably sauropsids. \n\"Protoclepsydrops\" is slightly older, but its status as a synapsid is unclear as the remains are more fragmentary.\nSystematics.\n\"Archaeothyris\" belonged to a group of early pelycosaurs that evolved early in the Pennsylvanian. It is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids (which include mammals).\nAppearance and lifestyle.\nUnlike the early sauropsids, \"Hylonomus\" and its kin, \"Archaeothyris\" was relatively large, measuring head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~reptiles), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged canines, suggesting that it was a carnivore.\n\"Archaeothyris\" lived in what is now Nova Scotia, about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period (Pennsylvanian). Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp, similar to today's Everglades in Florida. The 'trees' (actually giant clubmosses) were very tall. Some, such as \"Lepidodendron\", were up to tall. \"Archaeothyris\" and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor."}

Water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider.\nEvolution of water parks.\nWater parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association).\nWater parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort, a member of the World Water Park Association, is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the communities' destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides. A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented; e.g. Schwaben Quellen, a member of European Waterparks Association (EWA) has no water slides, but instead has many saunas, steam rooms, \"adventure showers\", and relaxation-oriented water play areas.\nFrom 2000's, popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions. To solve this problem, some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets.\nA unique feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion.\nIndoor water parks.\nThe first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the $1.2 billion dollar Phase III expansion. Called World Waterpark, it is over in size. It also includes one of the world's largest indoor wave pool, waterslides of varying degrees, tube rides, bungee jumping, and hot tubs.\nWith 5 indoor water parks, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, is recognized as the \"Water Park Capital of the World.\" It showcases several of America's largest indoor and outdoor water parks (see Noah's Ark Water Park). Indoor water parks in Wisconsin Dells debuted in 1994 after the Polynesian Resort Hotel built the first one in the U.S. The success in extending the tourist season and turning water park resorts into vacation destinations has resulted in tremendous industry growth. Usually resort hotels featuring massive indoor water parks that are often reserved exclusively for overnight guests, companies like Great Wolf Resorts/Great Wolf Lodge and Kalahari Resorts have branched out from their origin in the Dells to open new locations around the country. Mt. Olympus Theme and Water Park (formerly Family Land) is another huge water park in the Dells.\nThe premier UK indoor water park is the Sandcastle Waterworld at Blackpool, England which has the Master Blaster, the world's longest indoor roller coaster-style ride.\nThere are many water parks in Southern Europe where the climate suits a long season. For example in Portugal on the Algarve there are three main parks - Aqualand, Aquashow and Slide and Splash.\nWater play areas.\nWater play areas are similar to water parks and include urban beaches, splash pads, and smaller collections of waterslides in many hotels and public pools. For example, the Delta Chelsea hotel in Toronto features a four story waterslide called the \"corkscrew\".\nAnother unique waterpark feature is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in Indiana has ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their plaza."}

Most of this comes from Glamorgan in Wales (\"Morganucodon watsoni\").\nAccording to Kemp, it is impossible to say whether the rock fissures (cracks), where the remains were found, are latest Triassic or earliest Jurassic.p142\n\"Morganucodon\" first appeared about 205 million years ago. \"It was a small animal with a skull 2-3 cm in length and a body length of about 10\u00a0cm [4 inches]. In general appearance it would have looked like a shrew or mouse\".p143\nDistribution.\nFossils have also been found in the Yunnan Province in China (\"Morganucodon oehleri\"), in various parts of Europe and North America and some at least closely related animals (\"Megazostrodon\") are known from exquisite fossils from South Africa.p21/33, 174\nPhysiology.\nFrom their size and teeth, they may have been insectivores.p300\nThe small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation, which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur. Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat.p124\nBrain size is another factor. It is certain that early mammals did have enlarged brains relative to their size. Reconstructions of the brain size has shown this. Apparently, brain size in Mesozoic mammals lay within the lower range of brain size for living mammals. This is an overall increase of four or more times the volume of basal amniote brains. Very likely this involved the development of the neocortex, \"one of the most striking of all mammalian characteristics\".p120\nIs it a mammal?\nThere has been a long controversy about whether or not to classify it as a mammal. Some prefer to include it in a broader clade called Mammaliaformes.\n\"Morganucodon\" is regarded as very basal (= primitive). Its lower jaw has some of the bones found in its synapsid ancestors in a very reduced form. Mammals have a jawbone composed solely of the dentary.\nThe primitive jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones is still found in \"Morganucodon\".p107/112 In modern mammals these bones moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus, \"Morganucodon\" is unusual because, apart from still having the primitive hinge, it has also evolved the derived mammalian one and so has a double jaw joint.\nIts tooth replacement and determinate growth, are mammalian features.p324/346 Earlier synapsids replace their teeth throughout life, as sauropsids also do. This is known as \"polyphyodonty\", while mammals grow only two sets of teeth, in \"diphyodonty\"."}

The area has about 10,000 people. It has modern homes because a lot of new houses were built after World War II. It is known as a postwar overspill estate.\nThe area was originally known as Berwood, from the Saxon 'Bearu' meaning 'the woods'. Historically the area was a boggy and wooded area, and development only started when Edward Darcy began cutting down the trees in the 17th century and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was built in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the land became the site for the first aeroplane take-off in Birmingham which led to a long aviation history being associated with the area. Castle Bromwich Aerodrome was established on the site and operated from 1914 to 1960, being a major airfield in both World Wars and also having industrial importance as the testing facility for locally manufactured airplanes and the location for the British Industries Fair. \nCastle Vale became infamous from the 1970s onwards as a large scale example of a failed postwar overspill estate, which suffered from poor construction and maintenance, social deprivation and high levels of crime. The area became the focus of a targeted regeneration initiative, led by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (CVHAT) from 1993 to 2005, where the estate witnessed the demolition of many of its houses and facilities, the repair of remaining properties, and the construction of new housing and facilities along with the remodelling of the estate, funded both privately and publicly. It is now hailed as an example of a successful community-led regeneration scheme."}

They varied in size from a rabbit to a beaver.\nThey were the last family of the non-mammalian synapsids. One of the last cynodont lines to appear, the family Tritylodontidae descended from a \"Cynognathus\"-like cynodont. Their teeth had three cusps (bumps) which gave them their name.\nThe tritylodonts were herbivorous, chewing through vegetation, such as stems, leaves, and roots. Tritylodonts have no canine teeth, just incisors and cheek teeth. The jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards, shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth.\nThey were the longest surviving of all the non-mammalian therapsids. They appeared in the latest Triassic period, and persisted through the Jurassic until the middle of the Cretaceous. This shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids, even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaurs' feet, so to speak.\nIt is very clear that the tritylodonts were warm-blooded. The tritylodont fossils were found in the Americas, South Africa, and Eurasia. They may have managed to live worldwide, including Antarctica.\nThere are quite a few parallels between these tritylodonts (which are outside the mammal line) and multituberculates, which are mammals. The tritylodonts had no competition in the Jurassic, because all the other mammal-like types were either carnivores or insectivores. Kermack's conclusion is that when the multituberculates appeared (middle Jurssic) they were in direct competition, and eventually they out-competed the earlier group, and replaced it."}

He emigrated to New York City in 1837 when he became the American representative of the Rothschild family's banking house in Frankfurt. Later he became an American citizen, and married Caroline Slidell Perry, daughter of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry.\nEarly life.\nAugust Belmont was born on December 8, 1813\u2014some sources say 1816\u2014to Simon and Frederika Elsass Sch\u00f6nberg. His mother died when he was seven, and he went live with his uncle and grandmother in Frankfurt. He attended the Jewish Junior and Senior High School until he began his first job as an apprentice to the Rothschilds. He would sweep floors, polish furniture, and run errands while studying English, arithmetic, and writing. He was then given a confidential clerkship in 1832 and promoted to private secretary before travelling to Naples, Paris, and Rome. In 1837, Belmont travelled to Havana to manage the Rothschild's Cuban interests. On his way to Havana, however, Belmont stopped in New York. He arrived there during the Panic of 1837 and stayed to look afte Rothschild's interests there instead of continuing on to Havana. After he emigrated to the United States, he changed his surname, Sch\u00f6nberg (German for \"beautiful mountain\"), to Belmont (French for \"beautiful mountain\").\nAugust Belmont and Company.\nIn the Panic of 1837, hundreds of American businesses, including the Rothschild's American agents, went bankrupt. As a result, Belmont postponed his departure to Havana and began August Belmont &amp; Company, believing that he could supplant the recently bankrupt firm, the American Agency. August Belmont and Company was an instant success, and Belmont restored health to the Rothschild's US interests over the next five years. In 1844, Belmont was named the Consul-General of Austria at New York City. He resigned in 1850 because he thought Austria was cruel in the way it treated Hungary.\nEntrance into politics.\nBelmont married Caroline Slidell Perry, the daughter of Matthew Calbraith Perry, on 7 November 1849. Soon, John Slidell, his wife's uncle, starting helping Belmont. Belmont's first task was to campaign for James Buchanan in New York. In June, 1851, Belmont wrote letters to the \"New York Herald\" and the \"New York National-Democrat\", insisting that they do justice to Buchanan's presidential run. But Franklin Pierce won the nomination instead, and Belmont made large contributions to the Democratic Party. After his victory, Pierce in 1853 appointed Belmont \"charg\u00e9 d'affaires\" and minister to The Hague. While in Holland, Belmont urged American annexation of Cuba as a new slave state in what became known as the Ostend Manifesto.\nThough Belmont lobbied hard for it, Buchanan denied him the ambassadorship to Spain after his election in 1856, thanks to the Ostend Manifesto. As a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, Belmont supported Stephen A. Douglas, who subsequently named Belmont chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Belmont energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a War Democrat, helping Missouri congressman Francis P. Blair raise and equip the Union army's first mainly German-American regiment. Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the American civil war, stopping the Rothschilds and other bankers from lending to the Confederacy and meeting personally with the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, and members of Napoleon III\u2019s government.\nPostwar political career.\nBelmont stayed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the war, but he thought it was the worst ever time for the party. As early as 1862, Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the \"New York World\" in order to make it publish stories supporting the Democrats, with the help of Manton M. Marble, its editor-in-chief.\nThe Republican party was divided at the war\u2019s end, so Belmont organized new party gatherings and tried to get Salmon Chase elected president in 1868. He thought Chase was least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the party during the Republican Lincoln-Johnson administrations.\nHoratio Seymour\u2019s became the democratic candidate instead, and lost to Ulysses S. Grant by a lot of Electoral College votes, although the popular vote was much closer. In 1872 the Democrats supported liberal Republican Horace Greeley's disastrous presidential campaign. The election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but he stayed interested in politics as a champion of US Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware for the presidency, and as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in 1877, and as an advocate of \u201chard money.\u201d\nDeath.\nBelmont died in New York in 1890. The \"Letters, Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont\" was published at New York in 1890. Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars. He is buried in Newport, Rhode Island.\nBelmont's sons were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, Perry Belmont, and August Belmont, Jr..\nAugust Belmont in culture.\nAugust Belmont threw lavish balls and dinner parties, receiving from New York's high society mixed reviews.\nHe was an avid sportsman, and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honour. It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack, owned by Belmont's friend, Leonard Jerome. Today The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Racetrack in New York.\nAlso named in Belmont's honor is the town of Belmont, New Hampshire, an honor Mr. Belmont never acknowledged. Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in \"The Age of Innocence\" on Belmont.\nHam mousseline \u00e0 la Belmont was created in his honour by Charles Ranhofer at Delmonico's."}

Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version. Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken parmigiana, are popular in other countries, usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants. \nHistory.\nThe dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily. While \"parmigiana\" means \"from Parma\" (in Northern Italy), the dish is not part of Parma food. It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana (alt. parmigiana di melanzane) or eggplant parmigiana (or eggplant Parmesan), a classic Southern Italian dish. \nAlong with the many Italian versions, different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world, most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated. Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal (Veal Parmigiana) or chicken breast (Chicken Parmigiana) dipped in beaten eggs, breaded, shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce (red Sicilian tomato sauce) and mozzarella. It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown. The veal dish is known in Italian as \"Cotolette alla Bolognese\".\n\"Parmigiana\" is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food, such as \"Trippa alla Parmigiana\" (Parma-style tripe).\nCooking.\nThe dish consists of a sliced filling pan fried in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese, and baked in an oven. In some kinds, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying. Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo, or a combination of these.\nInternational variations.\nIn the United States and Canada, veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich. It is also popular with a side of or on top of pasta. Diced onions or green bell peppers, saut\u00e9ed or raw, are sometimes added.\nChicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish, often served with chips and salad. It may also contain a lot of toppings, including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices. This dish is often referred to as a \"parma\" or \"parmi\", a simple shortening of the name. \nA similar dish, the Parmo, which uses either pork or chicken, has been made within the country of England. \nName.\nThere are several theories for the origin of the name \"parmigiana\".\nOne common theory says the name is from Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese).\nAnother theory says the name is an alteration of the Sicilian word \"parmiciana\":\nThis is an ancient Sicilian dish which, in all cookbooks, is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese, which is one of the ingredients. Nothing could be further from the truth. The name \"parmigiana\" does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word \"parmiciana\", which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish.\"\nAs with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, the word \"Parmigiana\" is often rendered as \"Parmesan\" in English-speaking countries, from the French word for \"from Parma.\""}

Though veal can be made from a calf of either sex and any breed, most veal comes from male calves of dairy cattle breeds. Veal has a tender texture.\nAs food.\nVeal has been an important ingredient in Italian and French cuisine since ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include: fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small thick fillet steaks), stuffed paupiettes, roast joints and blanquettes. As veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets.\nAnimal welfare.\nVeal is a controversial issue in terms of animal welfare.\nMany animal welfare groups, who strongly focus on factory farming, try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be inhumane. This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry, resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry.\nA strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move. After people saw these photographs, people started buying less veal. They have not started buying more again.\nMany veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms.\nThe American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017, which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming. Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31, 2008.\nThough a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves can't move much and get sick, the Veal Quality Assurance Program &amp; Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet, and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt. They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves.\nOther uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal (slaughter at 2 or 3 days old), raising calves as \"red veal\" without the harsh food restrictions needed to create pale meat (resulting in fewer antibiotic treatments and fewer slaughtered calves), and as dairy beef.\nWhen it comes to the centuries-old method of free raised veal, calves never experience the stress of confinement, separation from their mothers and herd-mates, or an unnatural diet. Many veal producers are realizing this, and the demand for free raised veal is rapidly increasing.\nIn 2007, less than 5% of veal calves were raised in a group environment. In 2009, this had increased to 35%.\nVeal crate bans.\nThe following shows where veal crates have been banned, or are currently in the process of being banned:\nEurope.\nVeal crates became illegal in the UK in 1990, and a full ban has been placed for the entire European Union, as of 2007. Switzerland, with its substantial dairy industry, continues to use crates.\nVeal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries, such as in Finland. In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it, and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food.\nUSA.\nCrates are slowly being banned in the United States. As stated above, several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates, as well as the American Veal Association.\nState-by-state veal crate bans are as follows:\nCurrent active legislation in:"}
{"id": "286818", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286818", "title": "Hyssop", "text": "Hyssop (\"Hyssopus\") is a genus of about 10-12 species of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family Lamiaceae, native from the east Mediterranean to central Asia. They are aromatic, with upright branched stems up to 60\u00a0cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The leaves are narrow ovals, 2\u20135\u00a0cm long. The small blue flowers are on the upper part of the branches during summer. By far the best-known species is the Herb Hyssop (\"H. officinalis\"), widely grown outside its native area in the Mediterranean.\nNote that anise hyssop, \"Agastache foeniculum\" (also called blue giant hyssop) is a very different plant and not a close relation although both are in the mint family. Anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern North America.\nGrowing.\nThe name 'hyssop' can be traced back almost unchanged through the Greek word (\"hyssopos\") and Hebrew word (\"ezov\"). The Book of Exodus in the Bible records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of Passover. Its vomit-inducing properties are also mentioned in the Book of Psalms. In the New Testament, a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to Jesus of Nazareth on the cross just before he died. Both Matthew and Mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term (\"kalamos\"), which is translated as \"reed\" or \"stick.\"\nThe seeds are planted in spring and the seedlings planted out 40\u201350\u00a0cm apart. Hyssop can also be propagated from cuttings or root division in spring or autumn. Hyssop should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil, and will benefit from occasional clipping. It does not live long, and the plants need to be replaced every few years. It is good for use as a low hedge or border within an herb garden.\nHyssop also has uses in the garden. It is said to be a good companion plant to cabbage because it will deter the Cabbage White butterfly. It has also \"been found to improve the yield from grapevines if planted along the rows, particularly if the terrain is rocky or sandy, and the soil is not as easy to work as it might be.\" Hyssop is said to be bad for radishes, and they should not be grown nearby. Hyssop also attracts bees, hoverflies and butterflies, and so has a place in the wild garden as well as being useful in controlling pests and encouraging pollination without the use of unnatural methods.\nHyssop leaves can be preserved by drying. They should be picked on a dry day at the peak of their maturity and the amount of active ingredients is highest. They should be dried quickly, away from bright sunlight in order to keep their aromatic ingredients and prevent oxidation of other chemicals. Good air circulation is required, such as an airing cupboard with the door left open, or a sunny room, aiming for a temperature of 20-32\u00b0C. Hyssop leaves should dry out in about six days, any longer and they will begin to discolor and lose their flavor. The dried leaves are stored in clean, dry, airtight containers, and will keep for 12\u201318 months.\nHyssop is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Cabbage Moth.\nUsage.\nHyssop is used as an ingredient in eau de Cologne and the liqueur Chartreuse. It is also used to color the alcohol Absinthe, along with the Melissa plant and Roman wormwood. Hyssop is also used, usually in combination with other herbs such as liquorice, in herbal remedies, especially for lung conditions. Hyssop also kills bacteria, makes capillaries stronger, and reduces inflammation. It can help with about 81 different illnesses including cancer, bronchitis, insomnia, edema, colds, etc. When eaten in extract or tea form it gets rid of mucus in the respiratory tract, which relieves congestion, can regulate blood pressure, and can dispel gas. It also helps with circulatory problems, epilepsy, fever, gout, and weight problems. Poultices can be made from fresh hyssop to help heal wounds. It should not be used during pregnancy.\nRitual use.\nHyssop is a sacred plant used in Judaism. It appears a lot in the Hebrew Bible as Ezov. In Exodus 12:22 the Jews in Egypt are instructed to \"Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.\" It is used by the priests in the Temple of Solomon for purification rites of various kinds in Leviticus 14:4-7, 14:49-52, 19:6, 18. Hyssop is also often used to fill the Catholic ceremonial Aspergillum, which the priest dips into a bowl of holy water, and sprinkles onto the congregation to bless them. However, researchers say that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop. It might actually be one of a number of different herbs.\nThe Talmud calls the hyssop \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d0 and considers it to be an herbal remedy for indigestion.\nIn foods.\nHyssop leaves have a slightly bitter minty flavor and can be added to soups, salads or meats, but it should be used sparingly as the flavour is very strong."}
{"id": "286820", "revid": "145452", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286820", "title": "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle", "text": "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is one of the most important results of twentieth century physics. It relates to measurements of sub-atomic particles. Certain pairs of measurements such as (a) where a particle is and (b) where it is going (its position and momentum) cannot be precisely pinned down.p96\nAlbert Einstein thought that such a quantum theory could give us only a partial description of nature.p99 He thought that Heisenberg's discovery showed that human knowledge is limited, but he also thought that nature is absolute. That is, he thought that there is no \"uncertainty\" in nature, and that the uncertainty exists only in our knowledge about it. However, many other scientists disagree with Einstein.\nHeisenberg's idea is that if something like an electron were shot into a big box with a certain speed and in a certain direction, then it would be possible to calculate a fairly accurate idea of what its path would be like in the future. However, if the box were made smaller then we would have a more certain idea of where it was located, and because of that we would have to have a less certain idea of how it was traveling. American physicist Brian Greene gave the analogy of a moth which flies placidly around in a large closet but who flies frantically back and forth and up and down when placed in a glass jar.p114 Another interesting uncertainty phenomenon, which makes possible many electronic devices, is called quantum tunneling. In our everyday life, people cannot move through walls. However, electrons can move through solid walls.p115 In the animation to the right, you can see a faint white puff on the right side of the wall after a big puff hits the wall from the left. That dim spot of light represents the photon or other atomic particle which tunnels through the wall.\nConfusion with observer effect.\nHistorically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect. This says that measurements of some systems cannot be made without affecting the systems. Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level as a physical \"explanation\" of quantum uncertainty.\nHowever, it is now clear that the uncertainty principle is a property of all wave-like systems. It arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, \"the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology\". \"Measurement\" does not mean just a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer&lt;/u/l&gt;.\nThe idea of indeterminacy.\nThe uncertainty principle came from Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. Max Planck already knew that the energy of a unit of light is proportional to the frequency of that unit of light (formula_2), and that its amount of energy can be expressed in familiar terms such as the joule by using a proportionality constant. The constant he gave the world is now called the Planck constant and is represented by the letter h. When matrices are used to express quantum mechanics, frequently two matrices have to be multiplied to get a third matrix that gives the answer the physicist is trying to find. But multiplying a matrix such as P (for momentum) by a matrix such as X (for position) gives a different answer matrix from the one you get when you multiply X by P. The result of multiplying P by X and X by P and then comparing them always involves the Planck constant as a factor. The number used to write the Planck constant will always depend on the system of measurement in use. (With a certain system of measurement, its numerical value is one.) The slope of the line in the diagram to the right that shows the ratio of frequency to energy will also depend on the system of measurement chosen.\nThe following diagrams show what happens when we try to measure both location and momentum.\nThe practical result of this mathematical discovery is that when a physicist makes position more clear then momentum becomes less clear, and that when the physicist makes momentum more clear then position becomes less clear. Heisenberg said that things are \"indeterminate,\" and other people liked to say that they were \"uncertain.\" But the mathematics shows that it is the things in the world that are indeterminate or \"fuzzy,\" and not that it is just that humans are uncertain about what is going on.\nPutting indeterminacy into mathematical form.\nHere we will show the first equation that gave the basic idea later shown in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nHeisenberg's groundbreaking paper of 1925 does not use and does not even mention matrices. Heisenberg's great success was the \"scheme which was capable in principle of determining uniquely the relevant physical qualities (transition frequencies and amplitudes)\" of hydrogen radiation.\nAfter Heisenberg wrote his breakthrough paper, he gave it to one of his teachers to fix up and went on a vacation. Max Born was puzzled by the equations and the non-commuting equations that even Heisenberg thought were a problem. After several days Born realized that these equations were directions for writing out matrices. Matrices were new and strange, even for mathematicians of that time, but how to do math with them was already clearly known. He and a few others worked everything out in matrix form before Heisenberg came back from his time off, and within a few months the new quantum mechanics in matrix form gave them the basis for another paper.\nMax Born saw that when the matrices that represent pq and qp were calculated they would not be equal. Heisenberg had already seen the same thing in terms of his original way of writing things out, and Heisenberg may have guessed what was almost immediately obvious to Born\u2014that the difference between the answer matrices for pq and for qp would always involve two factors that came out of Heisenberg's original math: Planck's constant h and i, which is the square root of negative one. So the very idea of what Heisenberg preferred to call the \"indeterminacy principle\" (usually known as the uncertainty principle) was hiding in Heisenberg's original equations.\nHeisenberg had been looking at changes that happen in an atom when an electron changes its energy level and so gets closer to the center of its atom or gets farther from its center, and, especially, situations in which an electron falls to a lower energy state in two steps. Max Born explained how he took Heisenberg's strange \"recipe\" for finding the product, C, of some change in an atom from energy level n to energy level n-b, which involved taking the sum of multiplying one change in something called A (which could be, for instance, the frequency of some photon) produced by a change of energy of an electron in the atom between energy state n and energy state n-a) by a succeeding change in something called B (which could be, for instance, the amplitude of a change) produced by another change in energy state from n-a to n-b):\nand discovered something ground breaking:\nBy consideration of ...examples...[Heisenberg] found this rule... This was in the summer of 1925. Heisenberg...took leave of absence...and handed over his paper to me for publication...\nHeisenberg's rule of multiplication left me no peace, and after a week of intensive thought and trial, I suddenly remembered an algebraic theory...Such quadratic arrays are quite familiar to mathematicians and are called matrices, in association with a definite rule of multiplication. I applied this rule to Heisenberg's quantum condition and found that it agreed for the diagonal elements. It was easy to guess what the remaining elements must be, namely, null; and immediately there stood before me the strange formula\nLater on, Heisenberg put his discovery into another mathematical form:\nThe math is a way of describing things that happen in the real world. You might imagine that it would be easy to get both the exact position of something and its exact mass, path, and speed at the same time. However, in reality you have to do two things to get your answer. If you are measuring the position and momentum of a bullet that is stuck in a cliff of a great mountain somewhere, it is a simple matter. The mountain does not appear to be going anywhere, and neither is the bullet. So its position is known and its velocity is 0, so its momentum is also 0. But if the bullet is somewhere between a gun and a target, it will be difficult to get its position at any given time. The best we may be able to do is to take its picture using a camera with a very fast shutter. But a single squeeze of the shutter would give you only one thing, the bullet's position at time t. To get the momentum we might put a block of paraffin in the bullet's way and measure how the block of paraffin moved when it stopped the bullet. Or, if we knew the bullet's mass, we might take a sequence of two pictures, compute the velocity by knowing the difference between the two positions of the bullet and the time between its two appearances. However we do it, we need to measure mass and position and time between appearances. We end up making at least two measurements to get to x and p. In that case we have to choose which measurement to make first, and which to make second. It seems to make no difference which order our measurements are made in. Measuring the bullet's mass and then measuring its positions twice, or measuring the bullet's positions twice and then recovering the bullet and measuring its mass would not make any difference, would it? After all, we have not done anything to the bullet when we weigh it or when we make photographs of it.\nOn the very small scale when we are measuring something like an electron, however, each measurement does something to it. If we measure position first, then we change its momemtum in the process. If we measure the electron's momentum first, then we change its position in the process. Our hope would be to measure one of them and then measure the other before anything changed, but our measuring itself makes a change, and the best we can hope to do is to reduce to a minimum the energy we contribute to the electron by measuring it. That minimum amount of energy has the Planck constant as one of its factors.\nUncertainty goes beyond matrix math.\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle was found in the earliest equations of the \"new\" quantum physics, and the theory was given by using matrix math. However, the uncertainty principle is a fact about nature, and it shows up in other ways of talking about quantum physics such as the equations made by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\nIndeterminacy in nature, not uncertainty of humans.\nThere have been two very different ways of looking at what Heisenberg discovered: Some people think that things that happen in nature are \"determinate,\" that is, things happen by a definite rule and if we could know everything we need to know we could always say what will happen next. Other people think that things that happen in nature are guided only by probability, and we can know only how things will behave on the average\u2014but we know that very precisely.\nThe physicist John Stewart Bell discovered a way to prove that the first way cannot be correct. His work is called Bell's theorem or Bell's Inequality.\nPopular culture.\nThe expression \"quantum leap\" or \"quantum jump\" has been taken to mean some great and transformative change, and it is often used in hyperbolic expressions by politicians and mass media sales campaigns. In quantum mechanics it is used to describe the transition of an electron from one orbit around the nucleus of an atom to any other orbit, higher or lower.\nSometimes the word \"quantum\" is used in the names of commercial products and businesses. For instance, Briggs and Stratton manufactures many kinds of small gasoline motors for lawn mowers, rotary tillers, and other such small machines. One of their model names is \"Quantum.\"\nBecause the uncertainty principle tells us that certain measurements at the atomic level cannot be made without disturbing other measurements, some individuals use this idea to describe instances in the human world where the activity of an observer changes the thing that is being watched. An anthropologist may go to some far away place to learn how people live there, but the fact that a strange person from the outside world is there watching them may change the ways that those people act.\nThings that people do while observing things that change what is being observed are cases of the Observer effect. Some things that people do cause changes on the very small level of atoms and are cases of uncertainty or indeterminacy as first described by Heisenberg. The uncertainty principle shows that there is always a limit to how small we can make certain pairs of measurements such as position and speed or trajectory and momentum. The observer effect says that sometimes what people do in observing things, e.g., learning about an ant colony by digging it up with garden tools, can have big effects that change what they were trying to learn about."}

His explorations were for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) who were worried that La V\u00e9rendrye and the other western commanders were taking furs from the northwest to their forts.\nHenday volunteered to undertake an expedition into this territory. He came from the Isle of Wight, and was a convicted smuggler and joined the HBC in 1750 as a net-maker and labourer. Henday had gained some experience in inland travel after arriving at York Factory. On June 26, 1754, he set out with a group of Plains Indians. They passed the French Fort Paskoya where he may have met La Corne, the western commander at that time.\nIn October of 1754 he and his group came to what is now Alberta from York Factory with a mission to meet the Blackfoot and perhaps trade with them. The Blackfoot did not give a clear answer, but Henday decided they meant \u201cno\u201d, so he travelled back to York Factory with news that he had explored the area and had met with the Blackfoot. Since the answer had been unsure, there was no more expeditions to Alberta.\nThis trip, and later ones, took Henday across much of the prairies of what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta and his journal shows that he brought a lot of trade to York Factory. Records show that some of the trade also went to the French at Fort Saint-Louis (Fort de la Corne) and Fort Paskoya which were on the route to Hudson Bay. He left the service of the HBC in 1762 largely because his efforts for the company, at least in his estimation, had not been properly recognized.\nAnthony Henday Drive, a large ring road in Edmonton is named in his honour."}

Its theme is show business, based on Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the third park built at the resort. It opened on May 1, 1989, as Disney-MGM Studios.\nIn 2009, the park had around 9.7 million guests, ranking it the fourth-most visited amusement park in the United States, and seventh-most visited in the world.\nThe park symbol is The Sorcerer's Hat, which is based on the magical hat from \"Fantasia;\" it replaced the Earful Tower as the park's icon in 2001 but now both have been removed.\nAttractions.\nThe park has six themed areas. Unlike the other Walt Disney World parks, Disney's Hollywood Studios does not have a defined layout; it is more a mass of streets and buildings that blend into each other, much like a real movie studio would. The park used to have a large Hidden Mickey in the plaza at the end of Hollywood Boulevard which could be seen in aerial photographs of the park and on the park's early guide maps. However, construction and other changes to the park have gotten rid of much of this image.\nHollywood Boulevard.\nHollywood Boulevard is the park's main entrance and is lined with stores selling Disney merchandise. Parades such as the Pixar Block Party Bash travel down Hollywood Boulevard on their route through the park, and live street entertainment can be found here throughout the day. Michael Eisner, who had a major part in the park's creation ever since the earliest development, demanded the opening land operate on the same principle as Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom, but in a style more fitting to the Studios.\nAt the far end of Hollywood Boulevard is the Sorcerer's Hat, the icon of Disney's Hollywood Studios. Behind it, inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theater, is The Great Movie Ride, a dark ride with scenes from several classic movies, including \"Casablanca\", \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\nEcho Lake.\nEcho Lake is the park's small oval-shaped lagoon, which was designed to form one of the ears in the big Hidden Mickey from the park's original layout. Around it are many attractions and services, some in buildings designed to look like the \"California Crazy\" form of architecture from Hollywood's Golden Age.\nAt The American Idol Experience, park guests can audition and sing for live audiences, and win a special front-of-the-line pass for the popular TV series' real tryouts. Next door, \"Sounds Dangerous!\" features a 3-D audio presentation starring comedian Drew Carey. In between them is the A.T.A.S. Hall of Fame Plaza, a display of busts of past and present icons of the television era, such as Oprah Winfrey and Walt Disney.\nEcho Lake has three attractions based on characters and movies produced by George Lucas' Lucasfilm studio. \"\" is an upcoming motion simulator ride set in the \"Star Wars\" universe, and is a duplicate of the yet-to-be opened attraction at Disneyland. Jedi Training Academy, a live-action stage show, invites children to become \"padawan learners\" and receive \"lightsaber training\" from a Jedi master. Lastly, the live-action \"Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!\" re-enacts various scenes from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" while illustrating how movie stunts are performed.\nStreets of America.\nOriginally the New York Street backlot set that was part of the park's original Backlot Studio Tour, the section was later opened to pedestrian traffic. Recently, some of it was changed to look like San Francisco and New York. The current version of the Studio Backlot Tour features the American Film Institute Showcase, a rotating exhibit of movie props and memorabilia, and a tram ride through the backlot areas and through \"Catastrophe Canyon\", an effects-laden \"movie set.\" Kids can play on giant plants and toys at the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set Adventure, based on the 1989 Disney movie. Added in 2005, the \"Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show\" is a behind-the-scenes look at how car action sequences are made for movies, and is based on a similar show at Walt Disney Studios Park.\nAnimation Courtyard.\nThis section of the park was originally the starting point for the tours of the park's active production studios. Its entrance is marked by a square \"studio arch,\" much like a real Hollywood studio lot entrance might be marked. The Animation Courtyard is home to a number of attractions based on Disney characters of yesterday, today and tomorrow. The Magic of Disney Animation is an attraction that shows how to animate a character. It also has games and exhibits, along with meet-and-greet areas for Disney and Pixar characters.\nMickey Avenue, a section inside the Animation Courtyard, has two walk-through exhibits. is about the life and legacy of Walt Disney. It has photos, models, rare artifacts and a short biographical movie narrated by Julie Andrews. At \"Journey into Narnia,\" guests can see props and set pieces from the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" movie series (originally distributed by Disney; now handled by 20th Century Fox), as well as meet Prince Caspian from \"\".\nThe Courtyard section also has two live shows. \"Playhouse Disney Live on Stage!\" has puppet characters from \"Playhouse Disney\" shows on The Disney Channel, including Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Handy Manny, and Little Einsteins. Across the plaza, \"Voyage of the Little Mermaid\" uses glow-in-the-dark puppets, lasers, music, projectors, human actors and water effects to re-create favorite scenes and songs from the animated \"Little Mermaid\" movie.\nToy Story Land.\nThe park's newest section has many of the original soundstages used when the park still made TV shows. Today, Toy Story Land looks like the Emeryville, California campus of Pixar Animation Studios with attractions including Toy Story Midway Mania!, an interactive 3D attraction based on classic carnival midway games, each hosted by characters from the \"Toy Story\" movie series. Toy Story Land is also the home of Luxo Jr., a six-foot-tall audio-animatronic version of Pixar's desk-lamp mascot. The moving character performs periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania.\nSunset Boulevard.\nSunset Boulevard was the first expansion to Disney's Hollywood Studios, opening in July 1994. The main attraction on Sunset Boulevard is The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a thrill ride based on the classic television series. Located nearby is Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, an indoor roller coaster in the dark with three inversions that starts moving at a high speed.\nSunset Boulevard has two outdoor amphitheaters for live stage shows. The covered Theater of the Stars has \"Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage\", a stage show with scenes from the movie. The open-air Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is the home of \"Fantasmic!\", a nighttime show with Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters in a story filled with fireworks, lasers and water effects."}

They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 265\u2014245 million years ago, about 20 million years.\nThe therocephalians are named after their large skulls. Their skulls, with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were successful carnivores. \nLike other non-mammalian therapsids, therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles. In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals. \nThis relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features, possibly including whiskers and hair. There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny, anatomy, and physiology of therocephalians.\nThe fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa, but have also been found in Russia, China, and Antarctica. \nEarly therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group, which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world. Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, a few representatives of the subgroup (called Eutherocephalia) survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify.\nHowever, the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic.

One of these mountain ranges is called the Aleutian Range. It is part of the Ring of Fire, which means it is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and has lots of volcanoes. iSome of the bigger ones are Mount Katmai, Novarupta and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna, and Augustine Volcano.\nAlso in Southwest Alaska are the \"Pribilof Islands\", \"Nunivak Island\" and other Bering Sea islands. There is a very large river delta made by the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River. Further from the coast there are hundreds of miles of highlands. Parts of the Alaska Range are in Southwest Alaska.

There is not much of it that belongs to private persons.\nThe economy in Southwest Alaska is based on three main things. Resource extraction, meaning the removal of natural things like wood, coal, or fish. Subsistence, meaning people who get their own food is another. The third is government spending.\nFishing is important here. There are big boats that catch lots and lots of fish that end up in stores or in food made from fish. There are also lots of small boats where people fish for their own food or just for fun. A lot of the big boats are owned by people who don't live on Southwest Alaska. Kodiak and Unalaska are two of the most important fishing ports in the United States. They make a lot of money from catching salmon, trout, king crab, and halibut. Because so many of the big boats are owned by companies or people from outside Southwest Alaska most of the fish and the money they make from it does not stay in the area.\nHunting and other tourism are some of the other important businesses in Southwest, but only for part of the year.\nThere is also mining in Southwest Alaska. Most of the time they are looking for gold, platinum, or mercury. There is not a lot of mining but there are a lot of people who do not agree about it. One thing they don't agree on is the Pebble Mine, which would put a large open pit gold and copper mine near where a lot of the fish that are caught in Bristol Bay come from. Right now it is not allowed to drill for oil in Bristol Bay either, but some people in the government want to change that.\nWildlife.\nSouthwest Alaska is one of the best places in the world to catch salmon. There are also lots of brown bears. They come to eat the salmon, as well as berries and other plants. Bear watching is a popular tourist attraction at Katmai National Park and Preserve. This area is also home to a number of caribou herds. More western Aleutian Islands have no mammals larger than a fox. In the summer, lots of birds fly up and make their nests on the tundra here. A lot of the Aleutian Islands have lots and lots of seabirds on them.\nTransportation.\nThere is no way to get to Southwest Alaska in a car. There are roads in the towns and some of them have roads going to another town, but there is not a road going into the area from anywhere else. Because of that people travel by boat or airplane in Southwest if they need to go a long way. The town of Bethel is a place where big boats will come from the ocean. When they get to Bethel their cargo is moved onto smaller boats that go up the rivers. There are many airports as well. Some of them are big enough that big jets can land there, but a lot of them are small. Snowmachines, also called Snowmobiles are used here a lot in the winter. When the rivers are frozen people use them like a road to drive to another town."}

A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally.\nHypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke. \nHypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications. \nHypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose.\nThe brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough."}

It was the fourth park built there, and it opened on April 22, 1998. It is the largest Disney theme park in the world, covering more than . It is also the first Disney theme park to be themed around animal conservation, a philosophy once pioneered by Walt Disney himself. Disney's Animal Kingdom is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, meaning they have met or exceeded the standards in Education, Conservation and Research.\nSoon after the park opened, Disney advertised the park using the fictional word \"nahtazu\". It is pronounced \"not a zoo\". It was meant to state that the park is more than just a city zoo. Disney stopped using the word in January 2006.\nThe symbol of Disney's Animal Kingdom is The Tree of Life, a sculpted 14-story (145-foot-tall []), tree. The tree is man-made. The leaves are made out of resin. Tourists can walk around the whole park to see all 325 animals carved in the bark of the tree.\nIn 2009, the park had around 9.59 million guests, ranking it the fifth-most visited amusement park in the United States and eighth-most visited in the world.\nThemed areas.\nThe park has eight themed areas. \nOasis.\nThe Oasis is the park's main entrance. It has the guest services center and some animal habitats. Guests can see muntjacs, spoonbills, ducks, wallabies and giant anteaters, among others. The main paths lead into the park, and onto Discovery Island.\nA Rainforest Cafe is also at the entrance of the Oasis, but it is outside the park boundaries. Guests can eat at the restaurant without entering Disney's Animal Kingdom, while guests entering the restaurant from within the theme park are actually exiting the park and must show their tickets to go back into the park.\nDiscovery Island.\nDiscovery Island is near the center of the park, in the middle of the Discovery River waterway. It was originally called Safari Village, as Discovery Island was the name for the small zoological park in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. After it closed in 1999, Safari Village was renamed Discovery Island.\nThis is the \"central hub\" of Disney's Animal Kingdom, connecting almost all of the other sections of the park, except Rafiki's Planet Watch. The Tree of Life, the park's icon, is here, surrounded by animal enclosures with kangaroos, black crowned cranes, lemurs and others. The park's largest gift shops and two of its major restaurants are on Discovery Island, each with a different design theme, such as decorations based on nocturnal animals, insects and so forth. The island's other major draw is \"It's Tough to be a Bug!\", a 4-D film starring Flik and Hopper from Disney\u00b7Pixar's \"A Bug's Life\".\nCamp Minnie-Mickey.\nCamp Minnie-Mickey is themed as a summer camp. Here guests can meet the Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy and others. In the area's main theatre is \"Festival of the Lion King\", a live stage show featuring acrobatics and musical performances inspired by \"The Lion King\".\nAfrica.\nSet in the fictional east African village of Harambe, this area has many animal exhibits. Disney's story about Harambe is that it was once part of a Dutch colony, but a peaceful revolution made Harambe independent in 1963. Today, Harambe is the starting point for tourists and students who want to see Africa's animals in their natural habitats.\nThe village is the namesake of the Harambe Wildlife Preserve, the fictional home of Africa's main attraction, Kilimanjaro Safaris. Guests board an open-sided safari vehicle for a trip to see African animals freely roam through acres of savanna, rivers and rocky hills, including giraffes, hippos, African elephants and lions. On the nearby Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, visitors go into the forest in search of gorillas. Along the way, guests go on a nature walk through an African valley filled with Nile hippos, birds and fish.\nRafiki's Planet Watch.\nThe one section of the park not connected to Discovery Island, Rafiki's Planet Watch is instead connected to Africa. Guests board the Wildlife Express Train for the short trip to and from Planet Watch, which has three distinct areas. Guests first see \"Habitat Habit!\", where they can see cottontop tamarins and learn about the efforts to protect these endangered primates in their natural homes. Along the way, guests can also learn how to provide animal habitats in and around their own homes.\n\"Conservation Station\" shares the conservation efforts supported by the Walt Disney Company. It also gives a behind-the-scenes look into Disney's Animal Kingdom's animal care facilities, including a veterinary examination room complete with a two-way communications system so the veterinary staff can answer guest questions. Outside, \"Affection Section\" is a petting zoo with goats, sheep and other domesticated animals.\nAsia.\nAsia was the first area added to Disney's Animal Kingdom after the park opened. The Asia area opened in 1999. Like Africa, the section's attractions are part of a fictional place, the kingdom of Anandapur (which means \"Place of many delights\"). Anandapur is made up of two villages: the riverside village of Anandapur and Serka Zong, which is in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Portraits of Anandapur's royal family, the Maharajah and his wife, can be found in most of the businesses within the two villages, and a map of the kingdom, featuring both villages and their location relative to the mountains and river can be found on the wall of the Disney Vacation Club kiosk located there. Much like Harambe, Disney legend states that Anandapur is now a center of animal research and tourism. At the Caravan Stage, these two \"worlds\" meet in \"Flights of Wonder\", a live bird show where one of Anandapur's bird researchers educates a tour guide with a fear of birds about natural bird behaviors and the effects of habitat loss and conservation efforts on bird species, such as the Black Crowned Crane and American Bald Eagle.\nThe Maharajah Jungle Trek leads guests through the forests and ruins outside the village, which are home to many animal species, such as Komodo dragons, fruit bats, tapirs, and tigers. Nearby, Kali River Rapids is a river rapids ride along the fictional Chakranadi River through a rainforest, past an illegal logging operation and down a waterfall. Behind Anandapur is the Forbidden Mountain, the home of Expedition Everest, a roller coaster ride through the Himalayas.\nDinoLand U.S.A..\nDinoLand U.S.A. is inspired by the public's general interest in dinosaurs. The fictitious Dino Institute attracts those with a scientific interest in the long-extinct animals, while Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama recalls the many roadside attractions that were once scattered throughout the United States. Like the other areas of Disney's Animal Kingdom, there are animals on display.\nThese animals, such as the American Crocodile and Asian brown tortoise, have evolutionary links to the age of the dinosaurs. Other plant and animal species that have survived since the dinosaur era can be found along the Cretaceous Trail. At the edge of DinoLand U.S.A. is the \"Theater in the Wild,\" which has \"Finding Nemo - The Musical\", a live-action musical stage show based on the story of the Disney\u00b7Pixar feature film.\nThe Dino Institute is the home of DINOSAUR, a thrill ride trip through time to the Late Cretaceous Period. Just outside the Institute is \"Dino-Sue\", a casting of a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" fossil that is the most complete dinosaur skeleton found so far. At the nearby Boneyard, children can play in a multi-leveled playground area with a mammoth fossil to be uncovered.\nChester and Hester's Dino-Rama, on the other hand, is about dinosaurs as fun. The TriceraTop Spin is a colorful ride for families, while Primeval Whirl is a spinning roller coaster for thrill-seekers. Throughout the area are carnival games and gift shops, as well as chances to meet Disney characters.\nThe area was sponsored by McDonald's until 2009 when the contract ran out.\nPandora.\nPandora is inspired by the movie avatar"}

The resort is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks and Resorts division and is home to two theme parks, three hotels and a shopping, dining, and entertainment area. \nThe area now known as the Disneyland Resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s and for over 40 years was known simply as \"Disneyland\". When it opened to guests in 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its parking lot, and a hotel known as the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather. \nAfter doing well with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney decided to do the same thing in Anaheim and bought a lot of land next to Disneyland. This included buying the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather company as well as the Pan Pacific Hotel from its Japanese owners. Disney renamed the Pan Pacific Hotel to the \"Disneyland Pacific Hotel\". After its first publicly known proposal for a second theme park in Anaheim was scrapped, construction began in 1998 on a theme park called Disney's California Adventure Park; a hotel called Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, a renovation, renaming, and re-theming of the Disneyland Pacific Hotel; and an admission-free shopping and dining area called Downtown Disney. During the expansion, the name \"Disneyland Resort\" was coined to refer to the entire Disney complex, while \"Disneyland Park\" was coined to refer to the original theme park.\nLocation.\nThe Disneyland Resort is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, near the border of neighboring Garden Grove. The resort is bordered by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north. Interstate 5 borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner.\nNot all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north-south route and provides access to the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney.\nSpecial offramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit easy access into and out of the Mickey &amp; Friends parking garage during peak morning and evening traffic times. The official address of the resort is 1313 South Harbor Boulevard."}

The release of the Apple iPad in 2010 got much attention, and other companies made and sold more.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nCompared to laptop computers, tablets are lighter, more portable, have longer battery life, make less heat, and do not need a mouse or keyboard to be connected. Typing is usually done on the touch screen with a \"virtual\" keyboard which appears on the screen.

Some tablets can connect to computer keyboards and computer mice to let the user use them in ways similar to a PC. Tablets often have limited storage compared to a laptop.\nThe majority run a mobile operating system and may not support as many file formats and different types of software as laptops, but they may work with the same kinds of mobile apps that smartphones use.

They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals. \nThey are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.\nAnatomy.\nThe ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup. \nDevelopment.\nStudies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates."}

These people should then convince the local population to convert to the Christian faith. Very often, this couples evangelisation with humanitarian work. As well, the missionaries are priests, and can administer sacraments, but sometimes they are laypeople. Today, missionary activity often means cooperating with the local church. As an example, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Tanzania has sent missionaries to Mozambique.\nMissionary work is often criticized for the ways used. Examples are forced baptisms, proselytism, and that during colonial times, there were strong ties between colonialism and missionary work. Sometimes, there is the problem that the moral standards of the societies are very different from the moral standards of Christianity, missionary work will force different standards onto indigenous societies."}

They evolved once, early in the evolution of animals. They control the conversion of photons into electrical signals. For example, an opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in vision.\nComplex, image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times \u2013 using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction.\nComplex eyes appear to have first evolved within a few million years, in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion. There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian, but a wide range of diversity is evident in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale.\nEyes show a wide range of adaptations to meet the requirements of the organisms which bear them. Eyes may vary in their acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in low light levels, their ability to detect motion or resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours.\nRate of evolution.\nThe first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago. This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, dubbed the 'Cambrian explosion'. One biologist holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution. \nEarlier than this, organisms may have had use for light sensitivity, but not for fast movement and navigation by vision.\nIt is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution. Simple modelling, supposing small mutations exposed to natural selection, shows that a primitive optical sense organ based upon efficient photopigments could evolve into a complex human-like eye in about 400,000 years.\nEarly stages of eye evolution.\nThe earliest light sensors were photoreceptor proteins. They are eyespots, found in protists. Eyespots can only distinguish light from dark. This is enough for the daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. \nEyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups. The \"Euglena\"'s eyespot, called a \"stigma\", is at the front. Its red pigment shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light to assist in photosynthesis, and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms. \nThere are visual pigments in the brains of more complex organisms. They are thought to help synchronise spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms can synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the fertilisation of their eggs.\nVision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. How this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely. Eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules.\nAt a cellular level, there appear to be two main \"designs\" of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms).\nPAX6.\nPAX6 is the protein which is encoded by the \"PAX6\" gene.\n\"PAX6\" is a master control gene or \"transcription factor\" for the development of eyes and other sensory organs. It is medically important because various mutants produce eyesight defects."}

Most of the different types of music are similar to Western music types. Pop, classical, and folk are all included.\u00a0India\u2019s classical music has a history originating hundreds of years back and is still popular in India today, as religious inspiration or pure entertainment. Like Africa, India has many different ethnic groups, speaking their own languages, and having very distinct cultural traditions.\nThe tal, or\u00a0tala, is a repeating rhythm pattern usually played by the tabla. It usually has between six and sixteen beats. The beats are grouped into small sections in the pattern. The first note in the pattern is called a \u2018sam\u2019. It shows the beginnings and ends of improvisation, so it is often emphasized.\nThe\u00a0Raga\u00a0is also a pattern, but it differs from Western scales or melodies. Ragas are sort of a mix of scales and melodies. They have particular ascending and descending patterns. Ragas are used to symbolize the time of day, season, mood or special occasion.\nA\u00a0drone\u00a0is a note that\u2019s either held or repeated throughout a piece of music. It\u2019s usually the tonic note, the starting note. Nowadays, the drone is played by an electrical box, but traditionally, it is played using the tanpura, which is also known as the Tambura.\nImprovisation\u00a0is when the player does not have a prepared piece or an incomplete piece of music, and they make up notes as they play. Improvisation is recognized as a form of composition.\nThere are 4 types of structure in Indian Music, Alap, Jhor, Jhala and Gat/Bandish. Each of these has different roles in a piece of Indian music.\nAlap\u00a0is the name for the opening part of a piece of classical music from North India. It is a type of melodic improvisation that includes a Raga in it. Only the singer and the drone can be heard at this point.\nJhor\u00a0is a more elaborate version of the Raga that is included in the Alap. It forms the beginning of the performance. This comes after Alap and before\u00a0Jhala.\nJhala\u00a0indicates the fast-paced ending of the Raga. It is often distinguished by the overcoming of the melodic component by the rhythm.\nThe\u00a0Gat, or\u00a0Bandish\u00a0is a permanent composition set in a specific Raga. It is accompanied by the Tabla, a drone and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonica."}

As the volume decreases, the pressure increases in proportion, and vice versa. For example, when the pressure halves, the volume doubles.\nSuppose you have a tank that contains a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure. When you decrease the volume of the tank, the same number of gas particles is now contained in a smaller space. Therefore, the number of collisions increases. Therefore, the pressure is greater.\nImagine you have a gas at a certain pressure (P1) and volume (V1). If you change the pressure to a new value (P2), the volume changes to a new value (V2). We can use Boyle's law to describe both sets of conditions:\nThe constant, k, is the same in both cases, so we can say the following:\nExample: The pressure of a gas is 3 atm and the volume is 5 litres. If the pressure is reduced to 2 atm, what is the volume?\n\u2234 The volume will be 7.5 litres.\nThe law was found by Robert Boyle in 1662, and afterwards independently by Edme Mariotte in 1679."}

The author, C.Joh. Kieviet wrote the first book in 1891. It was called \u201cUit het leven van Dik Trom\u201d (\u201cFrom the life of Dik Trom\u201d). The books became extremely popular and they continue to be very popular today, more than 100 years after they were written.\nThe Life of Dik Trom.\nDik Trom was a naughty boy who got up to lots of tricks with his friends. However, he is a very honest boy and he is very kind, so the readers like him.\nDik Trom lived in the village of Hoofddorp in the Harlemmermeer in the north of Holland. This is the village where the author grew up, so he was setting the stories in his own village, and based a lot of the characters on real people he had known.\nDik\u2019s real name was \u201cDirk\u201d. This is a common Dutch name. Dirk was very fat, even as a boy, so he soon became known as \u201cDik\u201d (the Dutch word \u201cdik\u201d means \u201cfat\u201d). The word \u201ctrom\u201d means \u201cdrum\u201d so his name really means \u201cFat Drum\u201d.\nDik\u2019s parents love him very much, but they are no good at disciplining him. When he does something naughty his father just says: \u201c\u2018t is toch een bijzonder kind - dat is-ie\u201d (\u201che\u2019s a really special child, that he is\u201d).\nDik is always brave, he is never a coward. His friends want to go and annoy a little old lady, but Dik persuades them to go and annoy the village policeman, and he has a leading role in that adventure.\nAnother adventure tells how Dik said he could ride a donkey without falling off. The donkey belonged to the village merchant, and it was a stubborn beast that always tried to throw off its riders. Dik managed to stay on by sitting backwards on the donkey and holding on to its tail. This is how Dik is usually seen in pictures, and there is a statue of him in the village of Hoofddorp which shows him on the donkey.\nOther books about Dik Trom.\nKieviet found it difficult at first to find a publisher for his book, because the main character was naughty. Once it had appeared in a second edition with some illustrations it became very popular, and Kieviet followed it with four other books about Dik, and one about Dik\u2019s son. Eight films have been made about Dik Trom, the most recent in 2010."}

Backed by this evidence, the book said that evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life.\nPrecursors of the idea.\nIn the 18th century Linnaeus and others had classified man as a primate, but without drawing evolutionary conclusions. \nIt was Lamarck, the first to develop a coherent theory of evolution, who discussed human evolution in this context. \nRobert Chambers in his anonymous \"Vestiges\" also clearly made the point.\nThe book came five years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced their theory of evolution by means of natural selection, and four years after the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\". In the \"Origin\" Darwin had deliberately avoided tackling human evolution, except for a sentence: \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history\". Darwin's sequel came eight years later, with \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in relation to Sex\" (1871).\nContent and structure of the book.\nChapters.\nI. \"On the natural history of the man-like Apes\" p1\u201356. This contains a summary of what was known of the great apes at that time.\nII. \"On the relations of Man to the lower animals\" p57\u2013112. This chapter and its addendum contained most of the controversial material, and is still important today.\nIII. \"On some fossil remains of Man\" p119\u2013159. A neanderthal skull-cap and other bones had been found, and various remains of early \"Homo sapiens\". Huxley compares these remains with existing human races."}

As one would expect, unless given rights through other means, JOE will be denied:\nIf JOE is in the sudoer file, she can use the sudo command to run the ls command as if she were BOB:\nIf JOE is not in the sudoers file, she will be denied:\nAnother example, to delete a file (e.g. Example.php) normal users do not typically have permissions for, the user can type:\nWhen the password is entered correctly (assuming proper entries in the sudoers file), the computer would then run the command.\nPrograms with a graphical user interface can also be run with sudo, but it may mess them up.\nVarious desktops for Unix-like systems usually have their own version of sudo for such programs."}

The tumors can grow from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system. Most of the time, it comes from one of the adrenal glands.

There are three risk categories (types): low, intermediate (medium), and high risk. Low-risk disease is most common in infants, who usually get better, though they may need to have surgery. High-risk disease is very difficult for doctors to make better.\nEsthesioneuroblastoma, which is also called \"olfactory neuroblastoma\", comes from the olfactory epithelium and doctors are still not sure what type of cancer it is.

Technologies that were new or important to the Victorians, such as steam power, clockwork or electricity, are big themes in steampunk.\nImportant influences on steampunk are the Victorian \"scientific romances\", the first science fiction novels. Authors like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells are still very popular. Modern novels often cross-over with Goth and vampire themes.\nThe fictional style has become an active 'scene' where steampunks dress in costume and attend meetings or conventions. This costume is a large part of the scene. Many steampunks spend lots of time sewing their own outfits, or collecting accessories such as hats and goggles. The \"Maker\" movement involves many people who are both Makers and steampunks. They make Contraptions, fanciful devices as either art or a pretended function. Some of these contraptions are as large as cars, buses or even a steam-powered mobile house.\nSometimes this aspect is expanded to include cultural ideas of the 19th and early 20th century, such as small items like clothing and accessories, or large objects such as locomotives (trains) or machines that have not even been invented yet, like airplanes. \nSteampunk themes in fiction.\nSometimes steampunk is used in stories to give a rough, gritty feel. This is typical of American steampunk stories, where many stories are set around the Old West or the American Civil War. \nBritish steampunk is a contrast to this. Instead it considers Victorian society as a more polite society and tries to re-create a world of politeness, etiquette and distinctions between classes.\nNeither flavour of steampunk cares too much about historical accuracy. The purpose is to have fun, not to accurately re-enact a period of real history.\nFavourite Steampunk machines.\nSteampunks are very fond of particular machines and these keep re-appearing as themes in fiction or in costume.\nOrigins of the name.\nThe word \"steampunk\" is made of the root words \"steam\" and \"punk\".\nA well-known science-fiction author William Gibson, wrote books in the early 1980s that created the \"cyberpunk\" style. Later he, and the writer Bruce Sterling, wrote one of the early steampunk novels \"The Difference Engine\". This book was popular and readers looked for a term to describe this new style. They chose \"steampunk\", from \"steam\" and \"cyberpunk\".\nAn alternate story is that the term was coined by writer K.W. Jeter in a letter to Faren Miller at \"Locus\" magazine.\nDerivative styles.\nThere are several related styles that have grown from steampunk. These usually have names ending in \"-punk\". The best known is \"Dieselpunk\", which is set in the 1930s. Like the Steampunk fondness for Victorian steam machines, Dieselpunks like the Modernist style of the 1930s, with polished aluminium aircraft and petrol or diesel engines.\nAnother variety is set in the American frontier during the late 19th century. The American 1960s television series \"Wild Wild West\" is a good example of this.\nParanormal steampunk includes legendary creatures such as werewolves or vampires and mixes horror with steampunk."}

The computers on a home network can be arranged in a circle but it does not necessarily mean that it represents a ring network.\nBasic topology types.\nThere are seven basic topologies:\nWhich of these is chosen depends on what devices need to be connected, how reliable it has to be, and the cost associated with cabling.\nPhysical topology.\nThe shape of the cabling layout used to link devices is called the physical topology of the network. This refers to how the cables are laid out to connect many computers to one network. The physical topology you choose for your network depends on:\nTypes of Physical topologies.\nThe mapping of the nodes of the network and the physical connections between them\u00a0\u2013 the layout of wiring, cables, the locations of nodes, and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling or wiring system.\nPoint-to-point.\nThe simplest topology is a permanent link between two endpoints (the line in the illustration above). Switched point-to-point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony. The value of a permanent point-to-point network is the value of guaranteed, or nearly so, communications between the two endpoints. The value of an on-demand point-to-point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers, and has been expressed as Metcalfe's Law.\nMesh.\nIn most practical networks that are based upon the partially connected mesh topology, all of the data that is transmitted between nodes in the network takes the shortest path between nodes. The network used a longer alternative path in the case of a failure or break in one of the links. This requires that the nodes of the network possess some type of logical 'routing' algorithm to determine the correct path to use at any particular time.\nTree.\nAlso known as a hierarchy network.\nThe type of network topology in which a central 'root' node (the top level of the hierarchy) is connected to one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy (i.e., the second level) with a point-to-point link between each of the second level nodes and the top level central 'root' node. Each of the second level nodes that are connected to the top level central 'root' node will also have one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy (i.e., the third level) connected to it, also with a point-to-point link, the top level central 'root' node being the only node that has no other node above it in the hierarchy (The hierarchy of the tree is symmetrical.) \nEach node in the network having a specific fixed number, of nodes connected to it at the next lower level in the hierarchy, the number, being referred to as the 'branching factor' of the hierarchical tree. This tree has individual peripheral nodes.\nLogical topology.\nLogical topology describes the way in which a network transmits information from network/computer to another and not the way the network looks or how it is laid out. The logical layout also describes the different speeds of the cables being used from one network to another.\nThe logical topology, in contrast to the \"physical\", is the wignals act on the network media, or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices. A network's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology. For example, twisted pair Ethernet is a logical bus topology in a physical star topology layout. While IBM's Token Ring is a logical ring topology, it is physically set up in a star topology.\nThe logical classification of network topologies generally follows the same classifications as those in the physical classifications of network topologies but describes the path that the \"data\" takes between nodes being used as opposed to the actual \"physical\" connections between nodes.\nNotes:\nDaisy chains.\nExcept for star-based networks, the easiest way to add more computers into a network is by daisy-chaining, or connecting each computer in series to the next. If a message is intended for a computer partway down the line, each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination. A daisy-chained network can take two basic forms: linear and ring.\nCentralization.\nThe star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node. When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet, this central node (traditionally a hub) rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes also,\nIf the central node is \"passive\", the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission, delayed by the two-way round trip transmission time (i.e. to and from the central node) plus any delay generated in the central node. An \"active\" star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems.\nA tree topology (a.k.a. hierarchical topology) can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy. This tree has individual peripheral nodes (e.g. leaves) which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators. Unlike the star network, the functionality of the central node may be distributed.\nAs in the conventional star network, individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single-point failure of a transmission path to the node.\nIf a link connecting a leaf fails, that leaf is isolated; if a connection to a non-leaf node fails, an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest.\nIn order to alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes, more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network. These network switches will \"learn\" the layout of the network by \"listening\" on each port during normal data transmission, examining the data packets and recording the address/identifier of each connected node and which port it's connected to in a lookup table held in memory. This lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only.\nDecentralization.\nIn a mesh topology (i.e., a partially connected mesh topology), there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths to be used in case the link providing one of the paths fails. This decentralization is often used to advantage to compensate for the single-point-failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node (e.g., in star and tree networks). A special kind of mesh, limiting the number of hops between two nodes, is a hypercube. The number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement, but their decentralized nature makes them very useful. This is similar in some ways to a grid network, where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions. A multi-dimensional ring has a toroidal topology, for instance.\nA fully connected network, complete topology or full mesh topology is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes. In a fully connected network with n nodes, there are n(n-1)/2 direct links. Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up, but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes. This topology is mostly seen in military applications. However, it can also be seen in the file sharing protocol BitTorrent in which users connect to other users in the \"swarm\" by allowing each user sharing the file to connect to other users also involved. Often in actual usage of BitTorrent any given individual node is rarely connected to every single other node as in a true fully connected network but the protocol does allow for the possibility for any one node to connect to any other node when sharing files.\nHybrids.\nHybrid networks use a combination of any two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies (e.g., bus, star, ring, etc.). For example, a tree network connected to a tree network is still a tree network, but two star networks connected together exhibit a hybrid network topology. A hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected. Two common examples for Hybrid network are: \"star ring network\" and \"star bus network\"\nReferences.\nTendaishe Sigauke, (2007: 46) Explaining networking terms\nOther websites.\nTendaishe Sigauke, (2007: 46) Explaining networking terms"}

{"id": "287558", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287558", "title": "Prostatitis", "text": "Prostatitis is any form of inflammation of the prostate gland. Because women do not have a prostate gland, it is a condition only found in men, although women do have microscopic paraurethral Skene's glands connected to the distal third of the urethra in the prevaginal space that are homologous to the prostate, and may cause symptoms.\nA prostatitis diagnosis is assigned at 8% of all urologist and 1% of all primary care physician visits in the USA.\nNomenclature.\nThe term prostatitis refers in its strictest sense to histological (microscopic) inflammation of the tissue of the prostate gland, although historically the term has loosely been used as a rubric to describe a set of quite different conditions. To try to remedy this, the NIH devised a new classification system in 1999.\nClassification.\nAccording to the 1999 National Institute of Health (NIH) Classification, there are four categories of prostatitis:\nCategory I: Acute prostatitis (bacterial).\nSigns and symptoms.\nMen with this disease often have chills, fever, pain in the lower back and genital area, urinary frequency and urgency often at night, burning or painful urination, body aches, and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract, as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. There may be discharge from the penis.\nDiagnosis.\nAcute prostatitis is relatively easy to diagnose due to its symptoms that suggest infection. Common bacteria are \"E. Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Serratia,\" and \"Staphylococcus aureus.\" This can be a medical emergency in some patients and hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics may be required. A full blood count reveals increased white blood cells. Sepsis from prostatitis is very rare, but may occur in immunocompromised patients; high fever and malaise generally prompt blood cultures, which are often positive in sepsis.\nTreatment.\nAntibiotics are the first line of treatment in acute prostatitis (Cat. I). Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short period of time. Appropriate antibiotics should be used, based on the microbe causing the infection. Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule, others, such as Ciprofloxacin, Co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines penetrate well. Severely ill patients may need hospitalization, while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest, analgesics, stool softeners, and hydration.\nPrognosis.\nFull recovery without sequelae is usual.\nCategory II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis.\nSigns and symptoms.\nChronic bacterial prostatitis is a relatively rare condition (&lt;5% of patients with prostate-related non-BPH LUTS) that usually presents with an intermittent UTI-type picture and that is defined as recurrent urinary tract infections in men originating from a chronic infection in the prostate. Dr. Weidner, Professor of Medicine, Department of Urology, University of Giessen, has stated: \"In studies of 656 men, we seldom found chronic bacterial prostatitis. It is truly a rare disease. Most of those were E-coli.\" Symptoms may be completely absent until there is also bladder infection, and the most troublesome problem is usually recurrent cystitis.\nDiagnosis.\nIn chronic bacterial prostatitis there are bacteria in the prostate but usually no symptoms. The prostate infection is diagnosed by culturing urine as well as prostate fluid (expressed prostatic secretions or EPS) which are obtained by the doctor doing a rectal exam and putting pressure on the prostate. If no fluid is recovered after this prostatic massage, a post massage urine should also contain any prostatic bacteria. Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated, although there is no malignancy.\nTreatment.\nTreatment requires prolonged courses (4\u20138 weeks) of antibiotics that penetrate the prostate well (\u03b2-lactams and nitrofurantoin are ineffective). These include quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), sulfas (Bactrim, Septra) and macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin). Persistent infections may be helped in 80% of patients by the use of alpha blockers (tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin), or long term low dose antibiotic therapy. Recurrent infections may be caused by inefficient urination (benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder), prostatic stones or a structural abnormality that acts as a reservoir for infection.\nThe addition of prostate massage to courses of antibiotics was previously proposed as being beneficial.\nIt is though not without some risk, and has not been shown in more recent trials to improve outcome compared to antibiotics alone.\nPrognosis.\nOver time, the relapse rate is high, exceeding 50%.\nCategory III: CP/CPPS, pelvic myoneuropathy.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIn chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) there is pelvic pain of unknown cause, lasting longer than 6 months, as the key symptom. Symptoms may wax and wane. Pain can range from mild discomfort to debilitating. Pain may radiate to back and rectum, making sitting difficult. Dysuria, arthralgia, myalgia, unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, constant burning pain in the penis, and frequency may all be present. Frequent urination and increased urgency may suggest interstitial cystitis (inflammation centred in bladder rather than prostate). Ejaculation may be painful, as the prostate contracts during emission of semen, although nerve- and muscle-mediated post-ejaculatory pain is more common, and a classic sign of CP/CPPS. Some patients report low libido, sexual dysfunction and erectile difficulties. Pain after ejaculation is a very specific complaint that distinguishes CP/CPPS from men with BPH or normal men.\nTheories of Etiology.\nTheories behind the disease include autoimmunity, for which there is scant evidence, neurogenic inflammation and myofascial pain syndrome. In the latter two categories, dysregulation of the local nervous system due to past traumatic experiences or an anxious disposition and chronic albeit unconscious pelvic tensing lead to inflammation that is mediated by substances released by nerve cells (such as substance P). The prostate (and other areas of the genitourinary tract: bladder, urethra, testicles) can become inflamed by the action of the chronically activated pelvic nerves on the mast cells at the end of the nerve pathways. Similar stress-induced genitourinary inflammation has been shown experimentally in other mammals.\nProstatitis researcher Dr Anthony Schaeffer commented in a 2003 editorial of The Journal of Urology that: \"It is well recognized that even if pathogenic bacteria are present in the prostate, as in men with established chronic bacterial prostatitis, they do not cause chronic pelvic pain unless acute urinary tract infection develops. Taken together, these data suggest that bacteria do not have a significant role in the development of the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The clinical observation that antimicrobial therapy reduces symptomatology in men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome is being tested in a double-blinded NIH controlled study. Since antimicrobials may have anti-inflammatory activity, it is possible that these drugs may benefit the patient by reducing inflammation rather than eradicating bacteria.\"\nA year after making that statement, Dr Schaeffer and his colleagues published studies showing that antibiotics are essentially useless for CP/CPPS.\nThe bacterial infection theory that for so long had held sway in this field was again shown to be unimportant in another 2003 study from the University of Washington team led by Dr Lee and Professor Richard Berger. The study found that one third of both normal men and patients had equal counts of similar bacteria colonizing their prostates.\nSince the publication of these studies, the focus has shifted from infection to neuromuscular and psychological etiologies for chronic prostatitis (CP/CPPS).\nDiagnosis.\nThere are no definitive diagnostic tests for CP/CPPS. This is a poorly understood disorder, even though it accounts for 90%-95% of prostatitis diagnoses. It is found in men of any age, with the peak onset in the early 30s. CP/CPPS may be inflammatory (category IIIa) or non-inflammatory (category IIIb). In the inflammatory form, urine, semen, and other fluids from the prostate contain pus cells (dead white blood cells or WBCs), whereas in the non-inflammatory form no pus cells are present. Recent studies have questioned the distinction between categories IIIa and IIIb, since both categories show evidence of inflammation if pus cells are ignored and other more subtle signs of inflammation, like cytokines, are measured. In 2006, Chinese researchers found that men with categories IIIa and IIIb both had significantly and similarly raised levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF\u00df1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 in their expressed prostatic secretions when compared with controls; therefore measurement of these cytokines could be used to diagnose category III prostatitis.\nNormal men have slightly more bacteria in their semen than men with chronic prostatitis/pelvic myoneuropathy. The traditional Stamey 4-glass test is invalid for diagnosis of this disorder, and inflammation cannot be localized to any particular area of the lower GU tract.\nMen with CP/CPPS are more likely than the general population to suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated, although there is no malignancy.\nExperimental tests that could be useful in the future include tests to measure semen and prostate fluid cytokine levels. Various studies have shown increases in markers for inflammation such as elevated levels of cytokines, myeloperoxidase, and chemokines.\nTreatment.\nPhysical and psychological therapy.\nFor chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (Cat III), also known as pelvic myoneuropathy or CP/CPPS, which makes up the majority of men diagnosed with \"prostatitis\", a treatment called the Stanford Protocol, developed by Stanford University Professor of Urology Rodney Anderson and psychologist David Wise in 1996, has recently been published. This is a combination of medication (using tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychological therapy (paradoxical relaxation, an advancement and adaptation, specifically for pelvic pain, of a type of progressive relaxation technique developed by Edmund Jacobson during the early 20th century), and physical therapy (trigger point release therapy on pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, and also yoga-type exercises with the aim of relaxing pelvic floor and abdominal muscles). While these studies are encouraging, definitive proof of efficacy would require a randomized, sham controlled, blinded study, which is not as easy to do with physical therapy as with drug therapy.\nCat. III prostatitis may have no initial trigger other than anxiety, often with an element of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or other anxiety-spectrum problem. This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback (neural wind-up). Current protocols largely focus on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area (commonly referred to as trigger points), physical therapy to the area, and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress. Biofeedback physical therapy to relearn how to control pelvic floor muscles may be useful.\nAerobic exercise can help those sufferers who are not also suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or whose symptoms are not exacerbated by exercise.\nFood allergies.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that food allergies and intolerances may have a role in exacerbating CP/CPPS, perhaps through mast cell mediated mechanisms. Specifically patients with gluten intolerance or celiac disease report severe symptom flares after sustained gluten ingestion. Patients may therefore find an exclusion diet helpful in lessening symptoms by identifying problem foods. Studies are lacking in this area.\nPharmacological treatment.\nThere is a substantial list of medications used to treat this disorder.\nAlpha blockers (tamsulosin, alfuzosin) are moderately helpful for many men with CPPS; duration of therapy needs to be at least 3 months.\nQuercetin has shown effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in chronic prostatitis using 500\u00a0mg twice a day for 4 weeks. Subsequent studies showed that quercetin, a mast cell inhibitor, reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in the prostate.\nPollen extract (Cernilton)] has also been shown effective in randomized placebo controlled trials.\nCommonly used therapies that have not been properly evaluated in clinical trials are dietary modification, gabapentin, and amitriptyline. \nTherapies shown to be \"ineffective\" by randomized placebo/sham controlled trials: levaquin (antibiotics), alpha blockers for 6 weeks or less, transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA).\nAt least one study suggests that multi-modal therapy (aimed at different pathways such as inflammation and neuromuscular dysfunction simultaneously) is better long term than monotherapy.\nPrognosis.\nIn recent years the prognosis for CP/CPPS has improved greatly with the advent of multimodal treatment, phytotherapy and protocols aimed at quieting the pelvic nerves through myofascial trigger point release and anxiety control.\nCategory IV: Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThese patients have no history of genitourinary pain complaints, but leukocytosis or bacteria have been noted during evaluation for other conditions.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is through tests of semen, EPS or urine that reveal inflammation in the absence of symptoms.\nTreatment.\nNo treatment required. It is standard practice for men with infertility and category IV prostatitis to be given a trial of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatories however evidence for efficacy are weak. Since signs of asymptomatic prostatic inflammation may sometimes be associated with prostate cancer, this can be addressed by tests that assess the ratio of free-to-total PSA. The results of these tests were significantly different in prostate cancer and category IV prostatitis in one study."}

He thought the two topics were closely connected.\nIn the nearly 12 years between the \"Origin\" and the \"Descent of Man\", several writers had written works on the subject. Noteworthy were:\nBoth were published in 1863.\nSexual selection.\nSexual dimorphism.\nThe starting point for sexual selection is the observation that males differ from females, not just in sexual apparatus, but in many other traits. This is true of many animals, and the question is why this happens. The answer given by Darwin, and followed by many other biologists, is that the selection on males is different from the selection on females.\nSexual selection in Man.\nSexual selection is the theory proposed by Charles Darwin that states that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by intraspecific competition (competition between members of the same species).\nDarwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the \"struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex\".\nBiologists today distinguish between \"male to male combat\" or \"intrasexual selection\" (it is usually males that fight each other), \"mate choice\" or \"intersexual selection\" (usually female choice of male mates) and sexual conflict.\nSecondary sex characteristics are features that distinguish the two sexes of a species, but are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and fighting.\nTraits selected by male combat are called \"weapons\"; and traits selected by mate choice are called \"ornaments\"."}

{"id": "287585", "revid": "7892757", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287585", "title": "Minecraft", "text": "Minecraft is an open world sandbox video game originally made by Markus \"Notch\" Persson. It was run by a company called Mojang before being sold to Microsoft in 2014 for USD $2.5 billion. It is the best-selling video game of all time, and over 200 million copies of the game have been sold.\nIn Minecraft, players explore a blocky world filled with various 3D items. Many of these items are cubes, called \"blocks\". These include basic terrain and resources such as dirt, stone, wood, and sand. There are also items the player can use, such as crafting tables and furnaces. Players can use these to make new items such as tools and armor, as well as different kinds of blocks. Players can then build structures using these blocks, such as buildings, statues, pixel art, and more.\nMinecraft has two versions, Java and Bedrock. Java is the original version of Minecraft, but Bedrock is now more used due to it being multi-platform. Bedrock Edition is written in C++ but Java Edition is written in Java.\nHistory.\n\"Minecraft\" was originally created as an experiment to test random generation for caves. \"Minecraft\" was inspired by \"Infiniminer\", another game created by Zachary Barth. The first version of Minecraft was released for PC players on May 17, 2009. After going through alpha and beta versions, the full version was released on November 18, 2011. A version for Android was released on October 7, 2011, and an iOS version was released on November 17, 2011. At first, \"Minecraft\" was created only by Markus Persson. Other people started to work on it when Persson started an independent video game company called Mojang Specifications. The company was later renamed simply to Mojang. Later in 2011, a version of \"Minecraft\" named \"Pocket Edition\" was released for iOS and Android. In 2012, Persson gave Jens Bergensten the job of being the main developer of \"Minecraft\".\nMinecraft has also released on many video game consoles. On May 9, 2012, \"Minecraft\" came out on the Xbox 360 as a download through the Xbox Live Arcade. It was available for 1600 Microsoft Points ($19.99). In 2013, \"Minecraft\" came out as a disc for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On December 10, 2013, a Windows Phone version was released. Versions for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were released in September 2014. A version for the PlayStation Vita was released on October 14, 2014. The Wii U edition was released on December 17, 2015. In 2017, versions for the Nintendo Switch and the New Nintendo 3DS were released. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch versions were later all combined into Bedrock Edition.\nGameplay.\nAt the start of the game, players are put in a random location in the game world. They can begin breaking blocks to collect resources, such as wood and dirt, which can be used later in the game. Players can use resources to make new tools, such as pickaxes, which let the player gather stone. Different resources require different tools to collect them. For example, diamonds can only be collected with an iron pickaxe, or one of a better quality.\nThe game world is mostly infinite. As players explore it, the game makes new sections of the world using procedural generation. The game generates different kinds of terrain in biomes. Different biomes have different blocks in them. For example, a taiga biome will have lots of spruce trees and snow, whereas a plains biome will have lots of grass. The player can also find different structures in the world, like mountains and villages.\nThe game has non-player characters called \"mobs\" (short for mobile entity). There are many mobs in Minecraft. Some are real-life animals, like cows, pigs, and sheep. Some are based on monsters, such as zombies or skeletons. There are also some which do not exist in the real world in any way, and are unique to Minecraft, such as Creepers, Piglins, and Endermen. Each mob has different things it can do. For example, players can kill cows to get leather, which can make items, and beef, which can be cooked to make food. The Creeper, a hostile mob (meaning it tries to attack the player), will move close to the player and then explode, which usually causes so much damage it will kill the player instantly.\nMinecraft has very few goals. Players can choose how they want to play. They can choose to fight bosses, such as the Wither and the Ender Dragon, or choose to explore the world and build. If the player defeats the Ender Dragon, they can see the credits of the game. Minecraft also has lots of achievements called \"advancements\". These can range from simple things like sleeping in a bed for the first time, to complex things like discovering every biome in the game. Both boss fights and advancements are optional.\nIn addition to the default dimension the player starts in (called the \"Overworld\"), there are also two other dimensions in Minecraft - the Nether and the End. Both of these can be accessed with special portals. The player can make Nether portals using obsidian and flint and steel, but End portals have to be found in strongholds. While it is not necessary to go to these dimensions, they have lots of different items and enemies which can not be found in the Overworld. The Ender Dragon can only be fought in the End. After that, the player has a choice of going back to the overworld or to go to the end islands to find an end city and get an Elytra.\nGame modes.\nSurvival Mode.\nIn survival mode, players can gather resources found in the world to make lots of different items. Some of the items players can make include new blocks, tools, and armor. For example, players can turn wood into planks at the start of the game, which lets them make lots of things, like crafting tables and tools. Players can also place down these planks to build things, like houses.\nPlayers have a health bar and a hunger bar in this mode. The health bar is shown as 10 hearts and the hunger bar is shown as 10 steaks. Each heart and steak is worth two health points and two hunger points, respectively. The health bar depletes when players get attacked by monsters, lose all of their air underwater, walk into lava or cacti, fall from a high place, fall into the void, or if their hunger bar is depleted completely. Players can heal by staying still, drinking healing potions, and/or if they have a full hunger bar. Players will lose hunger by walking, sprinting and jumping too much. If they are low on hunger, they will not be able to sprint. They can fill their hunger bar by eating food.\nDuring the night, monsters come out to fight the player, but players can build a house to protect themselves from these monsters. If a player sleeps in a bed, they can skip the night, and go directly to the next day. However, they are unable to sleep if there are monsters near the bed.\nPlayers can only carry a certain number of items at any time, by holding them in their inventory. If the player dies, they drop their items, unless they have turned on Keep Inventory. Players can get their items back if they can find them before they disappear. They can then respawn, which sends them back to their spawn point, or the place they started the game at. Players can change their spawn point using items like beds. For example, a player can put a bed in their house to respawn there, and in the Nether players can use a unique block called a respawn anchor to respawn there.\nPlayers can play Survival Mode in four levels of difficulty: Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard. As the difficulty increases, the more damage monsters deal. In addition, certain mobs will gain certain abilities at higher difficulty levels. When a player creates a new world, the difficulty is set to normal by default. On peaceful difficulty, no monsters spawn, and the only way players can die is by deaths that aren't from mobs, such as falling from a high place, being in fire or lava, drowning, suffocating inside a block, or falling into the void.\nHardcore Mode.\nHardcore mode is like Survival mode, but the game is set to the hardest difficulty, which cannot be changed. The player also cannot enable cheats when they create the world and can only do so if they use the \"Open to LAN\" option in the game menu while they are playing. If a player dies in hardcore mode, they can not respawn, and can only play the world in Spectator Mode. If cheats are enabled, it is possible for the player to play in survival mode again by using commands to change the game mode. This game mode is only available in Java Edition.\nPlayers can also play a special version of hardcore mode known as Ultra Hardcore Mode, which is basically the same as hardcore mode except players do not naturally regenerate health. This mode can be accessed by creating a world in Hardcore mode, enabling cheats using the \"Open to LAN\" option in the game menu, and using commands to turn off natural health regeneration. The only way the player can regenerate health in this game mode is by using potions, golden apples, suspicious stews, and beacons.\nCreative Mode.\n[[File:Notch.jpg|thumb|[[Markus Persson|Markus Notch Persson]], Minecraft creator\nIn creative mode, players have infinite items. This is so they can build whatever they want, instead of having to look for resources. They cannot die, and do not have a health bar or hunger bar. Players can also optionally fly to reach places they normally couldn't.\nSpectator Mode.\nIn spectator mode, players become a \"spectator\". Spectators can look at the world, but not interact with it, meaning they can't place blocks or use items. They are invisible to other players.\nSpectators can fly around the world freely, or they can look at it from the [[perspective]] of other players and mobs, meaning they can see what the player or mob sees, as if they were looking through their eyes. This game mode is only available in Java Edition.\nAdventure Mode.\nAdventure Mode is designed for community maps. The player can not place or break blocks unless they have the right tools.\nMultiplayer.\nPlayers can play on the same Minecraft world together by using the multiplayer mode. They can connect to an online server by typing in the server's address (usually an [[IP address]]), or by making a game on the [[local area network]] (LAN). If the player makes a LAN game, only players on the same network can play. Much like the rest of Minecraft, players can choose what they want to do. For example, they can choose to fight each other, or work together and survive. All game modes can be played in multiplayer.\n\"Minecraft Realms\".\n\"Minecraft Realms\" is a special version of the original multiplayer. Realms are multiplayer servers hosted by Mojang. Players can buy them for a small fee. In \"Minecraft Realms\", there are several \"mini-games\", which are maps/games created by popular \"Minecraft\" users.\nCommunity.\n\"Minecraft\" has a very large community, with many fan forums and multiplayer servers such as Hypixel. The \"Minecraft\" community is also one of the largest on YouTube. Many people upload various types of Minecraft content to YouTube, such as [[parody]] songs, animations, gameplay, and more. Content can also be uploaded to platforms such as Forge. \nUpdates.\nMinecraft has had many new updates since it first released. These updates are usually announced before they are released. They add lots of new features into the game, such as new blocks, enemies, and items.\nMojang releases smaller development versions called \"snapshots\" which players can choose to play. These snapshots have a few new features in them, and are released as the developers are working on the new version. This is so players can try out new features before the full version is released.\nOther websites.\n[[Category:2011 video games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games]]\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Minecraft| ]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Online games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Wii U games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Sweden]]"}

It occurs in a species when what benefits the females is different from what benefits the males.\nThe word 'benefit' here means 'what benefits the reproduction of the female's (or male's) genes.

It has primarily been studied in animals, though it can in principle apply to any sexually reproducing organism, such as plants and fungi.\nFundamental difference of interest.\nIn sexual reproduction there is, from the point of view of evolution, a fundamental difference of interest between males and females. This difference of interest plays out differently in different species.\nTheir interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females, thus spreading their genes widely in the population.\nTheir interest is to mate with a large number of fit males, thus producing a large number of fit and varied offspring.\nExamples.\nSome regard sexual conflict as a subset of sexual selection (which was traditionally regarded as mutualistic), while others suggest it is a separate evolutionary phenomenon."}

Vernon is in the south-central region of British Columbia and is the largest city in the North Okanagan region. It is named after Forbes George Vernon, a former member of government in British Columbia. Including the areas around it, Vernon has a population of 58,584 as of the Canada 2011 Census. A person who lives in Vernon is called a \"Vernonite\".\nVernon was named one of the top six most desirable communities to retire to in North America by Consumer Reports in 2005. Vernon has a BCHL (British Columbia Hockey League) ice hockey team called the Vernon Vipers.\nHistory.\nThe site of the city was discovered by the Okanagan First Nations people, who named the community Nintle Moos Chin, which means \"jumping over place where the creek narrows\". This name refers to a section of the Swan Lake that passes through Downtown Vernon, the community's central business district. The Okanagan people settled around the city's two lakes, Okanagan Lake and Swan Lake, eating seasonal foods. Later, the land was renamed Priest's Valley because of the priests living in the valley around 1859. A town was created in 1885 and was named Vernon in 1887 in honour of Forbes George Vernon, a settler who became part of the British Columbian government.\nVernon started to develop in 1863, when gold was found in the surrounding lands. Centreville, the community's original business district, was formed in 1885. Vernon became an economic hub in the Okanagan because of its many cattle ranches and fruit orchard areas that attracted British families.\nVernon's growth quickened in 1891 after the Canadian Pacific Railway was opened in the Okanagan and Shuswap regions of British Columbia. Shortly after, the river boat \"S.S. Aberdeen\" was launched in 1893 to connect Vernon to other parts of the Okanagan. Fruit trees first grew in Vernon by the early 1890s, while water supplies were supplied to the community by canals by 1906. In 1908, the Okanagan Mounted Rifles military program was created, bringing a number of people to the area during World War I and World War II for lessons.\nVernon was incorporated as a city on December 30, 1892, with a city hall built in 1903 that included a fire hall and a public reading space. The following year, it was declared the largest municipality in the Okanagan and the first to contain a bank and telephone."}

{"id": "287803", "revid": "1149075", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287803", "title": "Electronic commerce", "text": "Electronic commerce more well known as e-commerce consists of the buying or selling of products via electronic means such as the internet or other electronic services. This type of trade has been growing rapidly because of the expansion of the Internet.\nThe need for electronic commerce emerged from the need to use computers more efficiently in banks and corporations. With the increasing competition, there was a need amongst organizations to increase customer satisfaction and information exchange. Electronic commerce started with the introduction of electronic funds transfer (EFT) by banks. Over time many variants of EFTs within banks were introduced like debit cards, credit cards, and direct deposits.\nTypes of E-commerce.\nThere are 5 common types of E-commerce:\nDisadvantages of E-commerce.\nE-commerce involves buying and selling of products and services by businesses and consumers through an electronic medium. Broadly, e-commerce is classified into four categories: business to business or B2B (Cisco), business to consumer or B2C (Amazon), consumer to consumer or C2C (eBay), and Business-to-Government (B2G). \nBangladesh.\nBusiness-to-business e-commerce involves agreements between 2 businesses. Distribution management, inventory management, channel management, supplier management and payment management are some of the areas in which B2B applications are widely used. In Bangladesh, bgmea.com.bd, bizbangladesh.com are examples of B2B platforms.\nB2C commerce involves e-commerce between businesses and consumers. This form of e-commerce involves the purchase of books or any form of consumer goods. It also includes the purchase of software, e-books, games, songs as well as e-banking. ajkerdeal.com, bdbazar.com, daraz.com, bajna.com are some examples of B2C. Advantages of B2C platforms to companies are reduced operating costs, bigger outreach, globalisation, customer convenience and knowledge management. Consumer-to-consumer e-commerce involves transactions between individual consumers. For instance, online auction, peer-to-peer system for money or file exchange can be classified as forms of C2C e-commerce. In Bangladesh bikroy.com, clickbd.com are examples of C2C platforms. \nB2G is usually used for licensing process, public purchasing and other government operations. B2G e-commerce is rather insignificant when compared to the other three forms. However, B2G can be one of the driving forces for running the public sector known as e-governance.\nA wide range of technologies is used in e-commerce that includes electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail (e-mail), electronic funds transfer (EFT). In the case of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), there needs to be an agreement between trading partners. EDI is a standard method for exchanging business data. E-mail and fax are also forms of EDI. In Bangladesh small, medium, and big enterprises have taken up e-business platforms. When compared to developed countries, developing countries have a higher potential for improving the business structure and raise productivity by using e-commerce as a medium. M-Commerce (Mobile Commerce) and F-Commerce (Facebook Commerce) are very popular in today's e-business world. Over the years, the number of online transactions has been on the rise. According to BTRC officials, the number of internet subscribers in Bangladesh had crossed 80 million in 2017. At present, there are approximately 2,000 e-commerce sites and 50,000 Facebook-based outlets delivering almost 30,000 products a day. Currently, 80 per cent of the online sales are taking place in Dhaka, Chattogram and Gazipur.\nOver the last few years, internet connections have improved and the number of people who have access to the web has increased thus making way for the e-commerce business to flourish. In 2016, $50 million was invested in the e-commerce sector in Bangladesh. Out of which $10 million was from Foreign Direct Investment. In 2017, the B2C e-commerce business market measure equaled USD 110-115 million (around BDT 9.0 billion) compared to BDT 1335.71 billion made by the retail market. The outreach of the e-commerce business market exceeded Tk 17.0 billion in 2017 from Tk 4.0 billion in 2016, as revealed from the findings by the e-Commerce Association of Bangladesh (e-CAB). The market measure for e-commerce is expected to equal Tk 70 billion by 2021.\nBefore 2013, the government had placed restrictions on the purchase and sale of goods and online services through international credit cards (export.gov, 2017). In the first three quarters of 2016, the e-commerce industry achieved 67 per cent growth whereas, the country's e-commerce transaction reached BDT 3.59 (Xinhua, 2016).\nAlthough the e-commerce sector has grown over the years, there remain many obstacles. Some of the key challenges are net neutrality, high-speed net, parcel delivery logistics and assurance of quality products. Foreign players also pose competition and risk to local start-ups. The sector suffers from a lack of logistics and a sound transportation system that restricts e-commerce trading to expand. The transportation system affects the delivery of products. Challenges also persist in the logistics sector. A large chunk of almost 65 per cent of the operations of the e-commerce companies takes place in the capital and Chattogram. The e-commerce companies fail to reach all parts of the country, including of course the rural areas, due to poor infrastructure and inability to access remote areas for lack of adequate transport facilities."}

The queen always tried to stay informed of political developments at court, and from the very beginning of his reign the new king consulted Louise on matters of state. \nThough Prussia had not fought in a war since 1795, its military leaders were confident that they could win against Napoleon's troops. After a small incident concerning an anti-French pamphlet occurred, King Frederick William was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the French emperor. Prussian troops began mobilizing, culminating in the October 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, which was a disaster for Prussia, as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out. The king and queen had accompanied their troops into battle at Jena (with Louise apparently dressed \"like an Amazon\"), but had to flee from French troops.\nNapoleon himself occupied Berlin, and the king, queen and the rest of the royal family had to flee, despite Louise's illness, in the dead of winter to K\u00f6nigsberg in the easternmost part of the kingdom. On the journey there, there was no food or clean water, and the king and queen were forced to share the same sleeping arrangements in \"one of the wretched barns they call houses\", according to one witness traveling with them.\nNapoleon demanded, from a highly superior position, peace terms in what was to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save \"her Prussia.\" She tried to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Before she had called him \"the Monster\", but now she made a request for a private interview with the emperor. She threw herself at his feet; Napoleon was impressed by her grace and determination, but he refused to make any concessions. Queen Louise's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression became well admired by future generations.\nOn 19 July 1810, the Queen died in her husband's arms from an unidentified illness. The queen's subjects attributed the French occupation as the cause of her early death. Louise's death left her husband alone during a period of great difficulty, as the Napoleonic Wars and need for reform continued. Napoleon remarked the king \"has lost his best minister.\""}

It is important in the study of sedimentary and layered vocanic rocks.\nHistorical development.\nThe subject was established by Nicolaus Steno whose book \"De solido\" contained these principles: \nWilliam Smith first used stratigraphy for a practical purpose in the 1790s and early 19th century. Smith, nicknamed \"Strata Smith\", made the first geological map of England. He understood that fossils could be used identify the same strata in different places. \nHe took samples and mapped the positions of the strata, noted the vertical extent of the strata, and drew cross-sections and tables of what he saw. Smith amassed a huge collection of fossils in strata he had examined. His most significant finding was:\nThere are many consequences of this idea. For geologists it means that when they find identical fossils in strata in different parts of the world, those strata were laid down at the same time. Also (this is a later realisation) the ecological conditions in which they were laid down would have been similar or identical in the different places. \nLithostratigraphy.\nLithostratigraphy deals with the physical rock type and how it changes from place to place. Changes in the rock (facies change) reflect changing environments of deposition. One of stratigraphy's basic concepts is codified in the \"law of superposition\", which simply states that, in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence, the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence.\nBiostratigraphy.\nBiostratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers. If strata from different places have the same fossil fauna and flora, they were laid down at the same time. \nBiostratigraphy was based on William Smith's \"principle of faunal succession\", which was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for evolution. It gives evidence of the formation (speciation) and extinction of species. \nThe geological timescale was developed during the 19th century based on the evidence of biostratigraphy and faunal succession. This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating, which gave it an absolute time framework."}

The normal circular motion of the water particles there is disrupted by the ocean bottom. As the water becomes shallower, the swell on the water surface becomes higher and steeper. After the wave breaks, the water flows violently, turbulently. This is where erosion of the ocean bottom and shore line intensifies dramatically. The most devastating effect may happen in the case of tsunami."}

One night after ashow he had just played with his band, he ended up breaking down by the side of the road.

And I think, for us, this is the opportunity to really create change. It's an opportunity for us to really strategize and have a game plan going forward. So I'm actually happy that there are no sports because there's nothing to distract people from the real issue that needs to be talked about.\""}

The Germans built one concentration camp and three Labour camps on the island, subcamps of the Neuengamme concentration camp (in Hamburg, Germany). Each subcamp was named after one of the Frisian Islands: \n700 people are estimated to died in the camps on Alderney, although it is now believed to have been higher. This was the only Nazi concentration camp on British soil.\nIt was organised by the Schutzstaffel - SS-Baubrigade I\u2013which was first under supervision of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp; and since mid-February 1943 ran under the Neuengamme camp in northern Germany\u2013near the old telegraph tower at La Foul\u00e8re. It was used by the Nazi Organisation Todt, a forced labour programme, to build bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters, and concrete fortifications.\n\"Sylt camp\" held Jewish enforced labourers. The prisoners in \"Lager Sylt\" and \"Lager Norderney\" were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. \"Norderney camp\" housed European (usually Eastern but including Spaniard) and Russian enforced labourers. The \"Borkum\" and \"Helgoland\" camps were \"volunteer\" (Hilfswillige) labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but marginally better than the inmates at the \"Sylt\" and \"Norderney\" camps. \"Lager Borkum\" was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. \"Lager Helgoland\" was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers. (For further information on Alderney concentration camps, see \"Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endl\u00f6sung \u2013 The Final Solution\"; \"Alderney, a Nazi concentration camp on an island Anglo-Norman\";)\nThe prisoners were from Russia and Europe, usually the east, but including Spanish Republicans. Some of the few remaining unevacuated Alderney natives (round about 2% of the population) also found themselves in there. In 1942, \"Lager Norderney\", containing Russian and Polish POWs, and \"Lager Sylt\", holding Jews, were placed under the control of SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Max List. Over 700 of the inmates are said to have lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to Germany in 1944.\nAlderney has been nicknamed \"the island of silence\", because little is known about what occurred there during the occupation. The rest of the island was heavily fortified, mainly through the slave labour of the camp inmates. The German officer left in charge of the facilities, Commandant Oberst Schwalm, burned the camps to the ground and destroyed all records connected with their use before the island was liberated by British forces on 16 May 1945. The German garrison on Alderney surrendered a week after the other Channel Islands, and was one of the last garrisons to surrender in Europe. The population were unable to start returning until December 1945.\nThe States (Alderney's governing body) decline to commemorate the sites of the four labour camps. Local historian Colin Partridge feels this may be due to the locals' desire to separat themselves from the accusations of collaboration. A faded memorial plate in the island's parish church mentions 45 Soviet citizens who died on Alderney in 1940-45 but does not say how they died and why."}

It was for many years the most popular apple in New England, New York, and for export from America.\nHistory.\nAccording to local tradition, the apple was found near Wood Hill by William Butters (1665-1746), son of Will Butter, first white settler in what is now Wilmington, Massachusetts. William Butters raised the tree in his yard, near the present Baldwin Apple Monument \"(pictured)\".\nAccording to S. A. Beach's \"Apples of New York\", the Baldwin originated soon after 1740 as a chance seedling on the farm of Mr. John Ball of Wilmington, Massachusetts, and for about 40 years thereafter its cultivation was confined to that immediate neighborhood. The farm eventually came into the possession of a Mr. Butters, who gave the name \"Woodpecker\" to the apple because the tree was frequented by woodpeckers. The apple was long known locally as the \"Woodpecker\" or \"Pecker\". It was also called the \"Butters\". Deacon Samuel Thompson, a surveyor of Woburn, Massachusetts, brought it to the attention of Col. Loammi Baldwin of the same town. Baldwin grew the apple and spread it across eastern Massachusetts. From Col. Baldwin's interest in the variety it came to be called the Baldwin.\nA monument to the Baldwin apple now marks the location (on today's Chestnut street in Wilmington). The monument's inscription reads: \"This monument marks the site of the first Baldwin Apple Tree found growing wild near here. It fell in the gale of 1815. The apple first known as the Butters, Woodpecker or Pecker apple was named after Col. Loammi Baldwin of Woburn. Erected in 1895 by the Rumford Historical Association.\"\nA harsh winter in 1934 wiped out many of the Baldwin apple orchards in New England. Its popularity as an eating apple waned, but some orchards were preserved for many years due to its desirability as a mixing apple for cider. However, the orchards have not been replaced when they played out. Baldwin Apples, unlike many apples, have long been prized for the making of hard cider. \"West County Cider\" makes Baldwin Cider from trees planted in the early 1900s. It is their most popular cider.\nThe apple is noted for its particularly small to medium size (ca. 6\u20138\u00a0cm), when compared to other apples like the Macintosh. It is an exceptionally hard apple and would remain remarkably free from blemishes and other blights with few pesticides being needed. Because of its hardness it shipped well without bruising and for a time was prized for this quality. Aside from cider making it was also known as an exceptionally good pie apple and due to its hardness would maintain more crispness through the baking than other apples would. "}
