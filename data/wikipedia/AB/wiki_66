A man shot and killed eight people at three spas on March 16, starting just before 5:00 p.m. A suspect, Robert Aaron Long, was caught south of the city that night. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police are investigating the crime.\nVictims.\nLong shot four people at Young's Asian Massage. Two of them died there and two others died later at a hospital. He shot three more people at Gold Spa. He shot another person at Aroma Therapy Massage.\nOf the eight people Long shot, seven were women and one was a man. Six of the eight people were Asian women; the other two were white. Four of the people were Koreans or Korean-Americans. Long shot a ninth person, a Hispanic man, but he did not die.\nSome of the victims have been identified publicly.\nSuspect.\nRobert Aaron Long was arrested by police about 150 miles south of Atlanta. Long was 21 years old at the time. He is white. He is from Woodstock, Georgia. People from the Atlanta Police Department say they have video evidence showing Long could be the shooter. The Atlanta Police also say Long confessed to the crime.\nAftermath.\nAuthorities charged Long with eight counts of murder. His church, Crabapple First Baptist Church, threw him out as well.\nIf authorities believe that Long killed the people because he hates Asians, he could be charged with a hate crime, which means he would spend more time in prison. Georgia passed a hate crime bill in 2020 after the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. The United States has had many more crimes against Asians than usual since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019. After the spa shootings, many Asian Americans held up signs and posted on the Internet \"Stop Asian Hate.\"\nLong told the police that he did not shoot the people because he hates Asians. He said he had sex addiction. The police said he shot the people because he thought of the massage parlors as a place that tempted him to have sex.\nIn an interview for the media, Captain Jay Baker from the Sheriff's Office said that Long had been having \"a really bad day\" and was \"at the end of his rope\" when he shot the people. Many people said this was a bad thing to say because it sounded like he was making excuses for the killer. Sheriff Frank Reynolds apologized: \"We regret any heartache Captain Baker's words may have caused.\""}

This is because it was inaugurated days after Belgium's 100th anniversary, with an unofficial Belgium-Netherlands football match. In 1946 the stadium was renamed Heysel Stadium (French: \"Stade du Heysel\", Dutch: \"Heizelstadion\"), after the area it was built in. The Heysel stadium hosted European Cup finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985, and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 66,000 in 1958.\nMay 1985 disaster.\nEven though it was Belgium's national stadium, Heysel was not well maintained. The stadium's poor condition became apparent at the 1985 European Cup Final. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. Additionally, the only escape route led upward, and there were only three gates on each short side\u2013nowhere near enough for the 22,000 people standing on the terraces on either side.\nThe stadium's inadequacies had been well known for some time. When Arsenal played there in the early 1980s, its supporters ridiculed it as a \"dump.\" Indeed, the presidents of the two 1985 European finalists, Juventus and Liverpool, had concluded that Heysel was in no condition to host a European Final, especially one featuring two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe at the time. They urged UEFA to move the match to another ground, to no avail. It later emerged that UEFA had only spent half an hour inspecting the stadium.\nThe Heysel Stadium disaster resulted in the deaths of 39 Juventus fans, after they were attacked by Liverpool fans before the match. Despite this, the stadium continued to be used for Belgium international games between 1986 and 1990, with minimal improvements to the stadium made after the disaster. This was mainly because the government had drawn up plans to remodel the stadium into a 35,000-seat facility. In 1990, UEFA forced the issue by barring Belgium from hosting a European Final until at least 2000. It continued to host track and field events and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year.\nModernisations.\nIn 1995, the stadium was rebuilt at the cost of BEF 1,500 million (around \u20ac37/$50 million in 1995). As well, the stadium was renamed to the King Baudouin Stadium, after the former Belgian monarch. It was re-opened on August 23, 1995, as the home of the Belgium national football team. It is the largest stadium in Belgium, with a capacity of 50,093. The remodeled stadium hosted the 1996 European Cup Winners Cup final, as well as the opening game for Euro 2000.\nIn March of 2019 the Belgian football association announced plans for a new redevelopment of the King Baudouin stadium. The stadium would be rebuilt to a reduced capacity of 40 000 spectators, and would be renamed to the Golden Generation Arena."}

Eutropia was the daughter of the Roman emperor ConstantiusI, the half-sister of the emperor Constantine the Great, and the mother of Nepotianus. Eutropia's mother was Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the wife of Constantius I.\nEutropia was written about by the Roman historians Eutropius, Aurelius Victor, and Zosimus. The bishop Athanasius knew her and also wrote about her.\nBirth and early life.\nEutropia was born after her parents married in late 289. Eutropia's father was ConstantiusI, who was made an emperor in 293. Eutropia's mother was Theodora. Theodora was the daughter of the emperor Maximian and his wife, who also had the name Eutropia. Eutropia had an older half-brother, Constantine the Great, and five other full siblings, the other children of Constantius and Theodora.\nConstantius's and Theodora's children were probably born after 295 and before 306. Theodora may have given birth to Eutropia after the year 300. Eutropia might have been her parents' youngest child.\nEutropia's full name may have been the , although it may have been . She probably had the title in . This was a title women of the emperor's family normally had. The emperor Constantius died in 306. Constantine then became an emperor.\nThere is no evidence that any of Constantius's daughters married before their father died. Eutropia's sister Constantia may have been the first to marry, and may have been the oldest of the siblings. She married in 313. Their sister Anastasia married in 316. Eutropia herself probably married by the early 320s, if she married the Roman consul of 336.\nMarriage.\nEutropia probably married Virius Nepotianus. He was Roman consul in the year 336. Eutropia's father was probably dead by the time she married, so her half-brother Constantine, now emperor, probably arranged her marriage. The choice of Eutropia's husband was probably for political reasons, just as Constantia's marriage to Constantine's co-emperor Licinius in 313 was for reasons of political strategy.\nVirius Nepotianus may have died in 337, the year Constantine the Great died. (After the emperor died, many people in Constantine's family killed one another in summer 337.) Eutropia survived because the emperor ConstantiusII did not kill the women in the family. The fact that Eutropia continued to live means that Ammianus Marcellinus was wrong when he wrote that ConstantiusII had killed everyone in his own family. The only other members of the family to live through the killings of 337 were Eutropia's nephews Constantius Gallus and Julian.\nAt some time after her wedding, Eutropia was probably the owner of a ship. A sign made of bronze that has been in the library of the Department of Classics at Harvard University since 1961 might have come from the ship. It was probably a \"No Trespassing\" sign. Its purpose was to keep people off the ship and to show that the ship was Eutropia's property. The bronze sign came from Ostia, the port of Rome, and the ship was possibly used for the transport of grain supplies to the capital city. The ship may also have been a barge on the Tiber River (the river that connects Ostia with Rome) or a boat used for private leisure.\nThe sign says that the ship was the property of \"Flavia Valeria Eutropia \". The means \"most noble woman\", and women from the emperors' families used this title. Because there are only two women named Eutropia in emperors' families, the ship very probably was the property of either Eutropia herself or her grandmother, Eutropia (wife of Maximian). The bronze sign is the only evidence for the name \"Flavia Valeria Eutropia\". It reads:\nThe bronze sign says that the ship was the property of Eutropia \"and her sons\" (or \"and her children\"). If the ship was the property of Eutropia the daughter of Constantius I, then the sign shows that she had more than one child. No-one knows when Eutropia's son Nepotianus was born. He is probably one of the children of Eutropia the bronze sign speaks of. Because no-one killed Eutropia's son Nepotianus in 337, it may be that Eutropia had not yet given birth to him at that time.\nWidow.\nEutropia lived in Rome for a long time, and both Athanasius and Zosimus wrote that she met Athanasius in Rome in the 340s. Eutropia may have given Athanasius political help when he came to Rome in late 339. He made a pun on her name, saying she was \"the aptly named Eutropia\" because the name \"Eutropia\" comes from the . Athanasius says that Eutropia was among those people who helped him in Rome, saying that she \"received us nobly\".\nIn the 5th century, Jerome wrote that Athanasius came to Rome to speak to powerful Roman women about the monks and monasteries in the desert of Roman Egypt. Jerome wrote that this was the start of monasteries in the west of the Roman Empire. This is probably not true, but Athanasius probably did lobbying with Eutropia and others to try to get back political power in the Christian Church. Eutropia was a woman in the emperor's family, so Athanasius will have tried to get help from her when he was in Rome between 339 and 342.\nAthanasius's writing may mean that Eutropia was a representative of the Constantinian family in Rome. Women from the emperor's family often represented the emperor in Rome, because the emperor was not often in the city. Eutropia lived in Rome at the same time as Constantina, Constantine's daughter, who lived in Rome from 337 to 351.\nDeath.\nWhen Eutropia's half-nephew, the emperor ConstansI died, Eutropia's son Nepotianus made an attempt to be emperor himself. Nepotianus took the emperor's title \"Augustus\" () in 350. Magnentius, who had killed Constans, soon killed Nepotianus.\nWomen in the Roman dynasties usually depended on the lives of the men in their family. Magnentius probably killed Eutropia in Rome \u2013 she died soon after her son Nepotianus died. Athanasius wrote about her death. Athanasius was also friendly with Magnentius's representatives. This may mean he was not in fact friendly with Eutropia and Nepotianus.\nWhen Magnentius was dead, Athanasius said to ConstantiusII in a speech that he had never written friendly letters to Magnentius. He says Eutropia was Constantius's \"aunt of blessed memory\". Athanasius said he had no reason to write to Magnentius, because Magnentius had killed many of Athanasius' friends. Athanasius asks rhetorical questions of Constantius, asking how Athanasius could have written to Magnentius after Magnentius had done so much against him and his friends:"}

It was played at the El Molin\u00f3n stadium in Gij\u00f3n, Spain, on June 25, 1982. The match was the last game of Group 2, with Algeria and Chile having played the day before. With the outcome of that match already decided, a win by 1 or 2 goals for West Germany would result in both West Germany and Austria qualifying ahead of Algeria, who had defeated West Germany in the first game. West Germany took the lead after 10 minutes, with the remaining 80 minutes being characterized by few serious scoring attempts on either side. Both teams were accused of match-fixing, although FIFA ruled that neither team broke any rules.\nAs a result of this, and similar events at the previous World Cup in Argentina, FIFA changed the group system for future tournaments, so that the final two games in each group would be played at the same time. In German, the match is known as (lit. \"Non-aggression pact of Gij\u00f3n\") or (lit. \"Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n\"), while in Algeria it is called (, \"Scandal of Gij\u00f3n\"); it is also called the (in reference to the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938).\nBackground.\nAlgeria began the tournament with a shock 2\u20131 win over West Germany on the opening day. This would be described as the \"greatest World Cup upset since North Korea beat Italy in 1966\", and as \"one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history\". Algeria became the first African team to defeat a European team at the FIFA World Cup. They then lost 2-0 to Austria, before beating Chile 3\u20132 in their final match. Algeria's win against Chile made them the first African team to win twice at a World Cup.\nAs Algeria played their final match the day before West Germany played Austria, the two European teams knew what result they needed in order to both qualify for the next round. A West German win by one or two goals would see both West Germany and Austria qualify. A larger West German victory, by three goals or more, would see West Germany and Algeria qualify (this is because Algeria had scored more goals than Austria, which meant they would qualify even with the same goal difference), while a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the West Germans.\nAftermath.\nWest Germany and Austria ended up advancing from the group, at the expense of Algeria. Austria ended up losing to France in Group D, while West Germany lost the final to Italy."}

Scots law is a mixture of a common law system and a civil law system. Scotland has its own judiciary and its own courts. Scotland kept Scots law from the old Kingdom of Scotland after the Acts of Union 1707 formed the British state.\nScots law is different from English law because the two kingdoms of Great Britain in the High Middle Ages and after, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England each had its own system of laws. The Scots jurisdiction kept its own legal system, and Scots law and Scots courts are independent of English law.\nAfter the personal union of Scotland with England and Ireland under their common king, James VI and I, Scotland kept Scots law and England kept English law. After the unification of the Parliament of Scotland with the Parliament of England by the Acts of Union 1707, the new Parliament of Great Britain in London's Palace of Westminster got the power to make Scots laws. The Parliament of Scotland, the old legislature, came to an end. Scots laws started again to be made in Scotland when the new Scottish Parliament came into being as a result of devolution in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Both the British and Scottish parliaments now make Scots law. These two legislatures are sometimes called \"Westminster\" and \"Holyrood\", named after the areas of the capital cities in which they meet."}

{"id": "830106", "revid": "1029354", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=830106", "title": "Dodge WC series", "text": "This article is about the World War II Dodge VC-, VF-, WC- and WF-models. For the civilian Dodge VC-, VF-, WC- and WF-Series trucks, see Dodge T-, V-, W-Series.\nFor the civilian post-War variant, see Dodge Power Wagon.The Dodge WC series, sometimes nicknamed 'Beeps', were a prolific range of light 4WD and medium 6WD military utility trucks, produced by Dodge / Fargo during World War II. Together with the 1\u20444-ton jeeps produced by Willys and Ford, the Dodge 1\u20442\u2011tons and 3\u20444\u2011tons made up nearly all of the light 4WD trucks supplied to the U.S. military in WWII \u2013 with Dodge contributing some 337,500 4WD units (over half as many as the jeep).\nContrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep, which was mostly achieved through field modification, the Dodge WC\u2011series came in many different, purpose-built, but mechanically uniform variants from the factory, much akin to the later family of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. The WC series evolved out of, and was part of a more extended family of trucks, with great mechanical parts commonality, that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers, (radio) command cars, reconnaissance vehicles, ambulances, carryalls, panel vans, and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks.\nThe Dodge WC series were essentially built in two generations. From 1940 to early 1942, almost 82,400 of the 1\u20442\u2011ton 4\u00d74 Dodge trucks were built \u2014 initially called the VC series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the WC series, and in more variants. Contrary to what the nomenclature would suggest, the 1941 WC models were a direct evolution of the 1940 VC models, retaining the U.S. Army's G-505 Ordnance Corps Supply Catalog number.\nIn 1942, the payload was upgrated, and the trucks grew into the G-502 3\u20444-ton 4\u00d74 Truck (Dodge) and the G-507 11\u20442\u2011ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge) \u2014 confusingly retaining the Dodge WC model code. Although the 3\u20444\u2011tons featured significant design improvements, they did retain some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the 1\u20442\u2011ton models \u2014 a vital Army requirement, for field maintenance and operability of the trucks.\nDodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of 1\u20442\u2011ton trucks, and its sole supplier of both 3\u20444\u2011ton trucks and 11\u20442\u2011ton 6x6 trucks in World War II. With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G-502 3\u20444\u2011tons were the most common variants in the WC\u2011series.\nAfter the war, Dodge developed the 3\u20444-ton WC\u2011series into the civilian 4\u00d74 Dodge Power Wagon; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar 3\u20444\u2011ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles .\nThough the majority of Dodges built were 'Weapons Carriers', \"WC\" was not abbreviated from this, but a general Dodge model code \u2013 initially \"W\" for 1941, and \"C\" for a (nominal) half-ton payload rating. However, the \"WC\" model code was simply retained after 1941 \u2014 for both the 3\u20444-ton, as well as the 11\u20442\u2011ton rated 6x6 Dodges.\nAll in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty 1\u20442\u2011ton 4\u00d74, eight 1\u20442\u2011ton 4\u00d72, twelve 3\u20444\u2011ton 4\u00d74, and two 11\u20442\u2011ton 6\u00d76 models). Creating vehicles of a common platform in such a variety of designs, with payloads ranging from 1\u20442\u2011ton to 11\u20442\u2011tons, had no equal in its time, and is seen as an extraordinary feat of the WWII American auto industry."}

His role in the history of Bengali literature, Bengali culture and Bengali Hindu society is unforgettable. Nadia is considered as the best man of the royal family. He was a scholar, educated in Sanskrit and Persian, and a musician. Krishnachandra, an intensely conservative king, was the patron of the proverbial geniuses of Bengal, such as Ramprasad Sen of Shaktapadavali, Bharat Chandra Raigunakar, the author of the Annadamangal poem, and the humorous Gopal Bhar. Annadamangal Kavya was composed in his royal court. The world famous pottery of Krishnanagar was started on his initiative.\nKrishnachandra Roy was a man of strategy. When Nawab Sirajuddaula clashed with the British, he sided with the British. He was captured during the reign of the next Nawab Mir Qasim. He was released due to the intervention of the English. The Company Government conferred the title of Maharaja on him for his loyalty.\nSignificant achievement.\nHis achievement is the worship of Jagadhatri in Bengal and the introduction of Shaktras in Navadvipa. According to legend, Krishnachandra was imprisoned in 1754 for failing to pay taxes to Nawab Alivardi Khan of Bengal. The time was near Durgotsab. When the fort festival was almost over when he was finally released from the Nawab's prison, on his way back to Krishnanagar, the king realized that it was Vijaya Dashami. The king fell asleep in the boat and there he saw in a dream that a purple quadrilateral virgin goddess was telling him to worship her on the Shuklanabami date of the next month of Kartik. As a result, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced. The following year, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced in Chandannagar by his friend Indranarayan Chowdhury. Also, Maharaja Krishnachandra initiated the worship of the idol of Malopara Baroari Jagadhatri (Mother Jaleshwari)."}

When the emperor Theodosius II died on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate to be emperor by Aspar. Aspar had power because he controlled the Roman army.\nAfter a month of negotiation, Pulcheria, Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. Zeno, a man with almost as much power as Aspar, may have been part of these negotiations. Zeno got the high title of after Marcian became emperor, perhaps as a reward. Marcian was inaugurated as Emperor on 25 August 450.\nMarcian undid many of the acts of TheodosiusII in the Romans' relations with the Huns (led by Attila) and in the organization of the Christian Church. Marcian soon broke all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila and the Huns were attacking the Italian Peninsula (part of the western Roman Empire), Marcian's armies attacked across the Danube river into the Great Hungarian Plain. There the Roman armies overcame the Huns in their own country. Because of this, and because of a famine and epidemic in northern Italy, the western Roman Empire was able to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian Peninsula.\nWhen Attila died in 453, it was the downfall of the Huns' power. Marcian improved the Romans' position by allowing Germanic peoples to live in Roman lands as allies. They did military service in exchange for this right. Marcian called together the Council of Chalcedon, which agreed that Jesus had two \"natures\": divine and human. This made the populations of Roman Syria and Roman Egypt Marcian's enemies. People in these places did not agree with this official Christology. \nMarcian died on 26 January 457. At the end of Marcian's life, the Empire's treasury was full of money. There were seven million more gold coins than were needed, even though the cost of the wars and treaties with the Huns had been high. After Marcian died, Aspar decided against Marcian's son-in-law Anthemius being emperor. Aspar used his power to make Leo\u00a0I emperor."}

It was created by the division of the land in 1392 and existed until the reunification of Bavaria after the Landshut War of Succession (1504/05). The residence of the dukes was Munich. It is often shortened to the Duchy of Upper Bavaria after one of its predecessors, especially after the union of Bavaria-Ingolstadt with Bavaria-Landshut in 1447.\nTerritorial development.\nThe four Bavarian partial duchies after the division of the land in 1392 (Bavaria-Munich green)\nIn the division of the land of 1392/93, the former duchy of Upper Bavaria and the northern Gaulish possessions, which Duke Otto V had received from Emperor Charles IV in 1373 as compensation for the Mark of Brandenburg, were split into two parts of roughly equal budgetary value: the highly fragmented Bavaria-Ingolstadt and the territorially much more coherent Bavaria-Munich.\nThe partial duchy of Bavaria-Munich essentially consisted of two areas separated by a narrow strip near Indersdorf, which belonged to Bavaria-Landshut. The northern part extended from Riedenburg an der Altm\u00fchl via Neustadt an der Donau and Vohburg to Mainburg and Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm. The larger southern part, located on the Isar River, was bounded on the west by the Lech River. It stretched from Dachau, F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck and Munich in the north to Starnberg, Wolfratshausen, Aibling and T\u00f6lz and on to Kochelsee and Walchensee in the south. In addition, Regenstauf and Stadtamhof north of the imperial city of Regensburg belonged to Bavaria-Munich. Nominally, Schwandorf, Burglengenfeld, Velburg and Hemau in the northern Gau were also part of the duchy, but they had already been pledged to the Palatine Wittelsbach dynasty around 1350.\nIn the 1420s, the dukes of Bavaria-Munich were able to significantly expand their territory. After the Bavarian War (1420-1422), they received the area around Ebersberg and Markt Schwaben from Bavaria-Ingolstadt, and in the Prussburg arbitration award of 1429, they were granted about half of the Straubinger L\u00e4ndchen. This meant that large parts of the Bavarian Forest around F\u00fcrth, K\u00f6tzting and Regen, as well as a wide strip south of the Danube with Kelheim and the royal seat of Straubing, fell to Bavaria-Munich.\nAfter the death of the last duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt in 1447, Bavaria-Landshut took over the territory of his duchy, while Bavaria-Munich went largely empty-handed. In the Landshut War of Succession, which broke out after the extinction of the Landshut line in the male line in 1503, the Munich duke Albrecht IV was finally able to secure almost the entire territory of the united duchies of Bavaria-Landshut and Bavaria-Ingolstadt, but he had to cede the \"Land im Gebirg\" around Kufstein, Kitzb\u00fchel and Rattenberg as well as Mondsee to Austria and possessions in the northern Gau and on the Danube to the newly created duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg. The Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, enlarged by Albrecht IV, is again referred to simply as Bavaria."}

While at university, she worked for the website \"Mogilev.Online\". She studied in the Department of Journalism of Mogilev State A. Kuleshov University, finishing in 2020. In 2020, she moved to the TV channel Belsat and worked there as a journalist. \nCriminal procedure.\nTogether with journalist Katsyaryna Andreeva, she became a person in a criminal case on organizing actions that attack public order. Both showed the event of a cruel attack of the police at the place where Raman Bandarenka was beaten to death and the people stood to support the dead one live. That took place at the \"\" (\"Ploscha Peramen\") in Minsk on November 15, 2020. \nShe was not freed after the arrest there.

It asked to make Chultsova and Andreeva free.\nOn February 15, 2021, support for the political prisoner was undertaken by Tony Lloyd, a member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\nFollowing the sentencing, on February 18, 2021, President of Poland Andrzej Duda made a public call to make Chultsova and Andreeva free.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Council of the European Union made a decision to put those responsible for the punishment of the journalists in the . Judge Natalia Buguk was put in the EU blacklist for frequent decisions against journalists and protesters in connection to politics. One example of such verdicts was named.

{"id": "831874", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=831874", "title": "2021 Suez Canal incident", "text": "On 23 March 2021, \"Ever Given\", a container ship, got stuck on the shore of the Suez Canal in Egypt. The ship was 400 meters long. A sand storm and strong winds of up to made it hit the banks in the canal. Authorities said that this was not the main reason for the accident and that something probably went wrong with the ship or the crew made a mistake. The ship crashed inside the Suez Canal; it blocked the canal completely and stopped other vessels from passing through.\nBy 27 March, four days after the ship got stuck, over 300 ships were queueing to pass through the canal while they waited for the problem to be resolved. On March 29th, 2021, the ship was finally free to move again. However, the event made a major impact on the global economy, because all cargo ships traveling across the Suez Canal were delayed.\nBackground.\nThe Suez Canal is one of the world's most important trading routes. It was opened in 1869. By 2021, over a century later, around fifty ships travel through the canal each day. This is about 12% of total global trade. When it was built, the canal was basically one way, with a part in the middle where ships could pass each other. Today, ships can pass each other in many parts of the canal. Where this is not possible, convoys of ships must take turns. The canal is being expanded, but most parts are still single-lane.\n\"Ever Given\" was first put into the water on 9 May 2018, and started operating on 25 September 2018. The owner is Shoei Kisen Kaisha, a company of Japan's Imabari Shipbuilding. The operator is the Taiwan-based company Evergreen Marine and the vessel is managed by Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. The vessel is registered in Panama. The ship's owners, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, have insurance covered for $3.1 billion. Evergreen's Protection and Indemnity (third party) liabilities insurance cover is provided by mutual UK P&amp;I Club. The ship is insured in the Japanese market. Insurance industry sources say the ship's owners could be facing insurance claims from the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for loss of money and other ships who were stuck behind it. Container ships of this size are usually insured for hull and machinery damage of between $100 and $140 million.\nBill Kavanagh, a National Maritime College of Ireland lecturer and former captain, has said that sailing through the Suez canal was very difficult, and risky. Wind can cause the container areas of vessels to act like a sail and affect the course of the ship. The momentum of a heavy ship, such as \"Ever Given\", is difficult to counteract if blown off course.\nThe government of Egypt requires ships traveling through the canal to be boarded by an Egyptian \"Suez crew\", including one or more official maritime pilots from Egypt's SCA. These people command the ship, taking over from the regular crew. There were two Egyptian SCA pilots on board at the time of the accident.\n\"Ever Given\" was travelling from Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia, to Rotterdam, Netherlands. It was fifth in a northbound convoy, with fifteen vessels behind it when it got stuck near the village of Manshiyet Rugola.\nOn 23 March 2021, at 07:40 EGY (05:40 UTC), the \"Given\" was travelling through the Suez Canal when it was caught in a sandstorm. The strong winds, which reached , resulted in the \"loss of the ability to steer the ship,\" and caused the hull to change direction. The \"Ever Given\" then ran aground at the mark (measured from Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea; from Suez Port on the Gulf of Suez). Suez is at the southern end of the canal. The ship turned sideways, and blocked the canal on both sides. The crew of the \"Ever Given\", was accounted for, and no injuries were reported. At this point, the Suez Canal is a single waterway.\nEvert Lataire, head of maritime technology division at the University of Ghent, looked at the situation and found that the bank effect may have contributed to the grounding. This effect causes the stern of a ship to swing toward the near bank when operating in constricted waterway. Other forces were winds pushing the ship from the side. Since most of the focus of modern ship design is directed towards efficiency and stability at sea, the effects of hydrodynamics in shallow waters need to be studied further.\nOver 200 vessels at both ends of the canal were stopped by \"Ever Given\", including five other container ships of similar size. These include 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers. The vessels represented roughly 16.9 million tonnes of deadweight. Some docked at ports and anchorages in the area, but many remained in place. The ships in the area range from small cargo vessels to large ships, including the Russian Navy Altay-class oiler \"Kola\", which had been involved in a minor collision with bulk carrier \"Ark Royal\" earlier that day.\nResponse.\nOfficials plan to move two vessels from behind \"Ever Given\" to make room for the refloating operation. Fuel and ballast water were removed from the ship to help lighten it; heavy machinery, including an excavator, worked to dig the bow out. Eight tugboats are assisting in the attempt to pull it free. Peter Berdowski, Chief Executive of Royal Boskalis Westminster, stated that the operation \"can take days to weeks\".\nOn 25 March, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) stopped navigation through the Suez Canal until the \"Given\" could be refloated. The same day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's advisor on seaports stated that he expected the canal to be cleared in \"48\u201372 hours, maximum\". The following day, the Suez Canal Authority said that its dredging operations were about 87 percent complete.\nOn 26 March, the SCA accepted an offer made by a United States Navy assessment team of dredging experts to assist in efforts to remove the ship.\nOn 27 March, the SCA said that 14 tugboats were trying to take advantage of that day's high tide and that more would arrive the following day if the latest attempt failed. Yukito Higaki, president of owners Shoei Kisen, reported that the ship did not appear to be damaged, saying \"The ship is not taking water. Once it refloats, it should be able to operate.\" There is no timeline of when the canal might be reopened. However, by 5:00 PM GMT, according to Egypt Today, the ship had moved by 30 meters (100 feet) towards the north. Delays in shipping may persist after the \"Ever Given\" is freed from its current predicament, as vessels may face busy ports and additional delays before offloading. As of 27 March, more than 300 ships are delayed at both ends and in the middle of the canal, with many more still approaching or having altered their paths.\nAddressing a press conference, Osama Rabie, SCA Chairman, said that weather conditions were \"not the main reasons\" for the ship's grounding, adding, \"There may have been technical or human errors... All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation.\"\nOn 28 March, the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, ordered preparations for lightening the ship's cargo.\nGlobal economic impact.\nExperts have warned that this incident will likely result in shipping delays of everyday items for customers around the world. \"Lloyd's List\" estimates the value of the goods delayed each hour at US $400 million, and that every day it takes to clear the obstruction will disrupt an additional US$9\u00a0billion worth of goods.\nMichael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy &amp; Economic Research, made a point that a rise in oil prices was caused by other people buying large amounts of oil while prices were low and then selling off oil at higher prices while oil was in shortage: \"people buying in after recent declines in oil prices, with the Suez closing the trigger factor\". James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics said that due to existing stocks \"a few days of slowdown in [oil] delivery is not critical to the market.\" After the Ever Green was freed on 29 March 2021, the oil prices dropped again.\nThe event will only delay goods, which might only impact industries with existing shortages such as with semiconductors. To act against shortages of goods in the long term, future shipments can be ordered earlier than normal until the difference has been made up. However, a consultant at another firm noted that even a short-term disruption at the Suez Canal would have a domino effect for several months along the supply chain. Some freight forwarders noted that demand for alternative means of transportation was expected to rise within the next few weeks on Europe to Asia routes as a consequence of shippers trying to avoid the disruption and uncertainty caused by the blockage of the canal.\nThe default alternative route for maritime traffic between Asia and Europe is to go around the African continent via the Cape of Good Hope, a trip of some taking approximately 10 to 12 more days. As of March 26, some ships had already taken that route. Russia has used this incident to promote its Arctic shipping routes as a shorter alternative to carrying goods around Africa.\nSeveral people have warned that the number of ships with valuable cargo in such a small area may attract pirates. Certain shipping companies already asked for United States fleet, based in Bahrain, to increase security."}

The ship ended up with its bow wedged in one bank of the canal and stern nearly touching the other.\nThe ship had been running fifth in a northbound convoy, with fifteen vessels behind it when it ran aground. Traffic in both directions was blocked for at least five days, leading to a traffic jam of over two hundred vessels. On 24 March, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the technical manager of the ship, denied earlier reports that it had been partially refloated. In addition, trade experts are worried about a supply chain delay, and tension due to the indefinite delay to the trapped ships as well as other vessels that planned to cross the Suez canal.\nEight tugboats worked to re-float the vessel in collaboration with a Komatsu excavator removing sand from the side of the canal where the bow of the vessel is wedged. After an overnight break, the salvage work resumed in the morning of 25 March.\nOn 25 March, an unnamed Egyptian official was reported as saying that refloating the ship would take days if not weeks. Lt. Gen. Ossama Rabei, head of the SCA, announced, \"The Suez Canal will not spare any efforts to ensure the restoration of navigation and to serve the movement of global trade.\" BSM and SKK said that all 25 crew are safe and accounted for. All crew remains on board, and there had been \"no reports of injuries or pollution\". Egyptian meteorologists reported that high winds and a sandstorm had affected the area on the day of the grounding, with winds reaching as much as .\nAddressing a press conference on 27 March, Rabie, Chairman of the SCA, said that weather conditions were \"not the main reasons\" for the ship's grounding.

The castle is on a hill and its position means that it can control the nearby valley and two Roman roads. The castle's builders were Crusaders. Between 1144 and 1271 the Knights Hospitaller used the castle. Because scholars have studied the castle and have restored the buildings, people say that Krak de Chevaliers is the best castle that the Crusaders built. The military design of the castle is complex and shows the last development of fortification by during existence of the Crusader states. It is one of the first \"concentric castles\" (castles with concentric layers of walls). Krak de Chevaliers was an important development in the design of castles, and many other castles' builders copied its design. No army in the Middle Ages ever took the castle by force. UNESCO has named the castle a World Heritage Site. \nHistory.\nKrak de Chevaliers stands on a hill which is high. The hill is at the southern end of the Jabal Ans\u0101riyya mountains, in a position looking over the Homs Gap. Nearby roads carry a trade routes between Antioch and Beirut. The hill has been a fortified place since the 13th century BCE. In 1031 CE, Kurds started to live there in a small castle. In 1110, the Crusaders attacked it took control of the castle. After the Crusaders set up the County of Tripoli, the Knights Hospitaller took control of the castle in 1142. The Knights Hospitaller were the builders of the castle whose ruins remain. The newer castle stands on top of the older 11th-century castle. The oldest buildings there now were built after 1142, when the Knights Hospitaller started to use the place. The first part of the castle to be complete was the centre. At the centre was a building whose shape was an approximation of a triangle. Here are the great hall and kitchens, the chapel, and the granaries, and around these is a thick, strong, masonry wall with towers. When Saladin saw it after his army's victory at the Battle of Hattin, he decided not to attack it.\nAt the end of the 12th century, the Knights Hospitaller built another defensive wall around the central castle, whereby they closed in of the hill. This wall was also very thick and strong. There are towers at positions along the wall. The first towers to be complete were square in shape, but the later ones were semi-circular. There were two gates with barbicans, one behind the other and joined together by a stone passage with a stone vault. Another postern gate was in the north wall, in a strong position. The Crusaders built many other buildings and made many improvements to the fortifications during this time. The castle was the Hospitallers' headquarters. The Crusaders built the castle's great hall () around 1200. The knights lived together in the great hall. Most of the buildings were complete by around 1220.\nAfter 1170, the castle's chapel was given new frescos. The frescos' painters did the work in a painting style that is like Byzantine art. The Byzantines' influence in the Crusader states was greatest between 1143 and 1169. The builders at Krak de Chevaliers did new work on the great hall building in the style of Gothic architecture.\nKrak de Chevaliers was one of several concentric castles that the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar built in the 13th century to stop Muslim armies attacking the Crusader states. The new design was necessary for the repulsion of armies that used new designs of catapults and trebuchets. Krak de Chevaliers had space for large rooms and cisterns with stone vaults. In these rooms and cisterns, the Crusaders could keep enough food and water to eat and drink for many years. The military design meant that the castle was nearly safe from attack. The stores of supplies meant that people in the castle would be safe from a siege. The design of Krak de Chevaliers is one of the best examples of a \"concentric castle\", along with the castles built by Edward I of England.\nThe Mamluk leader Baibars attacked Krak de Chevaliers in 1271. His army attacked with trebuchets and catapults. Baibars's army got inside the first wall, but they could not take control of the centre of the castle. Baibars wrote a false letter, which he sent to the Crusaders in the castle. They believed the letter had come from an ally of theirs. The letter said that the Crusaders should surrender. They did surrender, and the Mamluk army of Baibars took control of the castle. After this the Mamluks worked on the castle's buildings. Their builders repaired the buildings and fortifications, and they built a large new tower. The new tower was complete in 1285. (Baibars destroyed many other castles that he took from the Crusaders, but not Krak de Chevaliers.) Unlike many Crusader castles, Krak de Chevaliers continued to be a military position and a centre of government in its area. The castle started to be a town of its own. The frescos in the chapel were whitewashed."}

The mountains range runs in a north\u2013south direction along the coast of Syria. The range is about long. To the west of the mountain range is the plain along the coast, and on the west is the valley of the Orontes. (The Orontes runs through the Ghab Depression.) The tallest mountains in the range are in the north: there their average height is about , but in the south the average mountains are only high. The harbour city Latakia is to the west of the mountain range's highest mountain, which is high. Al-Ansariyyah is the only area of land in Syria which has thick forests. \nAt the southern end of the mountain range is the plain (the Homs Gap) which separates it from Mount Lebanon, in the country of Lebanon. On the south end is Krak de Chevaliers, a castle of the Middle Ages. In Classical Antiquity, the fresh water that came from these mountains supplied the cities of Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea. Laodicea (now Latakia) was famous for its wine (from vines grown in this region), and the Roman geographer Strabo wrote that most of the wine in Alexandria in Roman Egypt came from Laodicea. Latakia was famous in the more recent past for its tobacco production.\nThe mountain range is the homeland of the Alawites. In the Middle Ages, during the Crusades, the Order of Assassins lived in these mountains.\nPeople often migrate from the mountains to the plain of the coast and to the valley of the Ghab Depression, for economic reasons."}

This is disputed.\nOne of the things which made the film \"culturally significant\" was its use of character actors who could speak in dialects which are now dead or rare.

The case and console can sit together on a shelf to form a complete wave shape.\nControllers.\nThe Game Wave controller has 4 direction buttons and an OK button used to navigate menus and control how DVDs play. The controller has 4 buttons with letters of the alphabet near the top, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\", mostly designed to make choices in trivia games. A set of number buttons with Menu and Setup buttons are below the direction buttons.\nThe controllers came in 6 colors: blue, yellow, green, red, purple, and orange. The blue, yellow, green, and red ones come with the console, and the purple and orange ones could be bought separately for $30. Each controller color's infrared flashes at different speeds, allowing the console to support up to 6 controllers at the same time.\nGames.\nBecause of the shape of the controller and the company wanted the Game Wave to only be a \"Family Entertainment System,\" none of the console's 13 games are action games. Most games are trivia and puzzle games. Most games are like TV shows and other video games."}

While many notables report an insurrectional context and an armed support from Switzerland, correspondences of James Guillaume and Mikhail Bakunin attest to a confrontation prepared between the end of May and the beginning of June 1871.

This requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling stored air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks and the chordophone part is played with a bow. A chordophone needs a Pegbox, a neck and a resonance box, and an aerophone needs a pipe and a mouthpiece so the pipe under the mouthpiece became to peg box and neck to install finger board on it, and the lowest part of it became to a resonance box to install bridges, holes and keep the strings."}

It is one of the rarest instances of the conjugal love set in the region of Ancient Moirang kingdom. The first page of the text mentions that the book was written during the period of King Garib Niwaj (Pamheiba) of Medieval Manipur. The story reflects the then society of Ancient Moirang. It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Nongban Pombi Luwaoba (Nungpan Ponpi Luwaopa).\nStory.\nThangwai Koting Ahanpa (Thangwai Koding Ahanba) (337 AD-387 AD) was the ruler of Ancient Moirang and Leima Thamoilembi (Thamoilengpi), his queen. For sometime, the latter felt quite happy as she was with child, but suffered a shock as it disappeared through a natural abortion. However, Salailen (Soraren), the God of Heaven, sent the child back to her womb with the instruction that he should be born to the Queen as her son, but should not live long with her to attain the age of any rite of passage. Five months went by. Salailen (Soraren) appeared in her dream and told her that the child she was carrying was His own and that when born he should not be brought up on any propane food or drink. After she was delivered of the child, the God again appeared in her dream, reminded her of His relation with the child and expressed His desire to call him \"Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba\". Then the boy grew up and soon attained the grace and vigor of a youth. As human memory, by nature, is short, his parents had completely forgotten the divine dictates. Meanwhile, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba, one day, chanced to see Sunulembi, the daughter of Thongnang Loikemba (of Cachari origin) and was instantly head over heels in love with her. Through a formal engagement, the two were married in a grand manner. But God's will is irrevocable and the young man had overstepped what was set for him. So, Salailen came in person and reminded during his sleep of what was enjoined on his parents. While awake, Sunulembi, his lady found him in tears enquired whether he had any secret love. At last, he came out with what to take place within five days and the same was conveyed in the early morning to his parents, friends and relatives. On the appointed day, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba, prinked up in his best clothes with the help of his wife, and was now prepared for the heavenly journey. But Sunulembi, his lady too offered herself to keep her husband company to the land of the leal. None could restrain her and leaving all the near and dear ones thrown into an abyss of sorrow, the young couple ascended towards the sky, the progress of which was being watched by all on the ground with bated breath and by shading the eyes with their palms.\nSoon afterwards, they were on the threshold of another sphere which was under deep waters of flood. The gate of heaven was thrown open and the guard posted there instantly prepared a bridge to which only the husband was granted entry. But on the earnest insistence of Sunulembi, both were allowed to cross. They went up to another hemisphere where their passage was blocked by a swarm of snakes. This time, on the request of her husband to the poisonous creatures, Sunulembi was allowed to proceed. On reaching the precincts of Salailen's abode, they were forbidden access as no couple could lead a worldly life in heaven. At last, the all-powerful God directed Sunulembi to return to earth and feed the man only with heavily victuals. But Sunulembi resisted it with all her might and with eyes bathed with tears, kept her husband tightly held in her arms. She also threatened of ending her life there from thirst and starvation. Hearing this, Salailen was flummoxed and immediately sent a ferocious wild boar as big as a bull to cause harm to the bewailing woman. But Sunulembi was the least awed by it and unflinchingly was ready to die the painful death. Next, a dreadful tiger was sent on her which too could not terrify her. Thirdly, she could easily withstand the surging waves of a devastating flood. Fourthly, the scorching flames of a wild fire left her untouched. Lastly, the god engaged a hill kite to snatch her away, which too miserably failed.\nAt long last, being moved her irrepressible spirit and devoted love, the God gave her husband back and over and above that the sceptre of the kingdom of Ancient Moirang was bestowed on Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba with a blessing of long and plentiful reign with his wife. As they descended straight alive and with radiant joy from heaven in broad daylight, the people of the kingdom were taken by surprise. But they were overjoyed at seeing the couple and instantly made Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba (387 AD-447 AD) the king.\nPantheon.\nPresently, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba is also venerated as a serpentine dragon deity in Meitei mythology and religion."}

{"id": "833052", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=833052", "title": "World religions", "text": "World religions is a category used in the study of religion for the largest and most widespread religious movements. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are always included in the list; they are known as the \"Big Five\". Some scholars also include other religions, such as Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, or the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. The term \"world religions\" is used to compare them with other groups, such as indigenous religions and new religious movements.\nThe term was first used in the 1960s. Scholars such as Ninian Smart first used it, because he wanted to get away from looking at religions form a focus of Christianity. Smart also wanted to take other religious traditions into account. \nThe concept of \"world religion\" has also been criticized: Scholars such as Johnathan Z. Smith have said that it should be abandoned. They say, the concept is bad because it takes the Protestant view as the model of what is a religion. Protestantism is a movement that developed recently. According to the scholars, it takes an uncritical standpoint, and it dictates what religions should be called \"major\". Other people have argued that the concept is useful, as long as people are aware of its shortcomings.\nDefinition.\nThe scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the \"World Religions Paradigm\" as a way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' importance. It typically consists of the \"Big Five\" religions: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.\nAs noted by Cotter and Robertson, the \"Big Five\" religions are often listed in an order which places the largest three Abrahamic religions\u2014Christianity, Judaism, and Islam\u2014before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism. The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, such as Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIncluding Judaism in the Big Five is problematic: Because it influenced Christianity and Islam it is often included. It is also historically important. Looking at the number of its followers, however, it does not fit in the list: There are far fewer Jews than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. It does also not fit the list, because the other groups want to spread their religion; Judaism doesn't.\nMany scholars have used the \"World Religions\" category alongside other \"catch-all\" categories such as \"new religious movements\" and \"indigenous religions\". The scholar of religion Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the English football league system, with the \"world\" religions forming a Premier League, the \"new\" religions forming a Championship, and \"indigenous\" religions a First Division. That groups that get placed in categories like \"indigenous religions\" get treated less seriously than the \"world religions\" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey. Harway said that \"indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'.\""}

The band is best known for making Ricky Gervais perform in public for the first time. The band had little success, except their song \"More to Lose\" become popular in the Philippines.\nHistory.\nRicky Gervais and his friend Bill Macrae started \"Seona Dancing\" while learning at University College London. Gervais wrote and sung the lyrics, and Macrae made the music and played keyboards. They recorded a demo tape with 16 songs, then were signed to London Records, which released two of their songs: \"More to Lose\" and \"Bitter Heart\". In June 1983, they performed \"More to Lose\" on the children's television show \"Razzmatazz\", which was shown on ITV. Despite that, and \"Bitter Heart\"'s promotion with a music video, \"More to Lose\" reached number 117 and \"Bitter Heart\" number 79, not reaching the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. This made the band end in 1984. Gervais later became successful around the world as a comedian and actor. When Jimmy Kimmel asked him about Macrae in an interview in 2014, he answered \"I hope he got fat, too.\"\nPopularity in the Philippines.\nIn 1985, DWRT-FM (then known as 99.5 RT, now 99.5 Play FM), a radio station in Metro Manila, Philippines, started playing a song, which they chose to give the false name of \"Fade\" by Medium (or \"Medium\" by Fade) to stop anyone finding and playing it. They also tried to stop other radio stations from recording and playing it by adding a station ID in the middle of the song. 1 year later, another radio station, DWXB-102, revealed the song is actually \"More to Lose\" by Seona Dancing.\nThe song, which uses repeating piano sounds to represent falling teardrops, has been popular on the radio, in clubs and at high-school dances from the 1980s. AllMusic critic Michael Sutton wrote that the track was \"the theme song of angst-ridden New Wave youths in the Philippines\" and \"an '80s anthem as ubiquitous as Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes', but with the eternal hipster cool of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'.\"\nMusic.\nAn unofficial CD with all of the band's songs (except the 7\" versions of \"Bitter Heart\" and \"Tell Her\") on it, named \"More to Lose\", came out in 2005."}

According to the regulation of the FIFA, each star is equivalent to a world-wide conquered. \nAnother confirmation was coming from of a book published by the FIFA and that contains a section that certifies, with vintage official documents, the position of Uruguay like four times \"World Champion of the FIFA\". \nIn 2021, FIFA asked the Uruguayan federation to remove 2 stars from the game uniform.

It is based on the novel by Shane Connaughton, and stars Albert Finney and Matt Keeslar.\nPlot.\nThe story tells of a political and generational conflict in a teen romance and coming-of-age story in Ireland. Albert Finney stars as a policeman with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in a small County Cavan village just south of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The sergeant, with nothing to do, hopes for just one murder to solve and make himself famous. His real concern, however, is that his relationship with his 18-year-old son Danny (Matt Keeslar) has been strained since the recent death of his wife from a heart attack during a domestic quarrel. Danny blames his father for his mother's death and resents his father's bullying ways, so he moves in with his best friend Prunty (Anthony Brophy). Danny then falls in love with Annagh (Victoria Smurfit), a beautiful, red-haired northerner, and their relationship, which becomes sexual, brings Danny's conflict with his headstrong father to a boil.\nProduction.\nNovelist Shane Connaughton, who also wrote the script for \"My Left Foot\" (1989) and \"The Playboys\" (1992), adapted the script from his novel. The movie shares some of the same thematic and stylistic qualities of Yates's second movie of 1995 \u2014 \"Roommates\".\nThe movie was mainly filmed on location in Redhills and near Ballyhaise, neighbouring villages in County Cavan. Some scenes were filmed in Clones, County Monaghan, a town near Redhills. Other locations in the Republic of Ireland were also used.\nReception.\nMichael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said, \"Peter Yates' best or best-remembered movies...all excel at showing male interaction. And that's one of the strong points of \"Run of the Country.\" Just as Finney's outstanding trait as an actor is the solidity he gives his parts\u2014his growly voice and bulldog chin pulling the audience one way, his yearning eyes pulling them another\u2014Yates's direction, at its best, has an earthy reliability.\""}

He invented the system for cleaning drinking water so as to eliminate cholera.\nAs chief engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works his work was in response to the Great Stink of 1858. He invented the system for cleaning sewage which is basically the same as used today. It stopped the city from having cholera epidemics. Until then, cholera had been endemic in all large cities throughout the world, beginning in Roman times. \nBazalgette took the polluted water though sewage treatment plants, after which the clean water was returned to the Thames. \nVictorian London became one of the few large cities in the world to be free of epidemics carried by the water supply. The British later built the water and sewage systems in many other countries, especially those in, or connected with, the British Empire (Cairo, Khartoum, New Delhi and so on). The growth in population has made the water unsafe again in many places, but round about 1900 a clean water supply was available in many parts of the world. All this was a consequence of Snow's work, and Bazalgette's engineering..\nCholera has returned in modern times. Cities have outgrown the sewage systems built in the late 19th century. Governments have spent money on armaments rather than engineering. Uncontrolled population growth has meant the return of cholera to a world where it was once eliminated.\nBazalgette was also the designer of the Hammersmith Bridge."}

Some of them are important because of increased transmission and vaccines being less effective on them. This article discusses relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations in these variants.\nThe variant \"WIV04/2019\" is most closely related to the original virus when it began infecting humans.\nOverview.\nThere are a lot of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Lineages are variants that are genetically the same.\nNomenclature.\nThere's no consistent nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2. Variants are usually refered to by the country where the variant came from. For example, B.1.1.7 is usually called the \"UK variant.\"\nCriteria for importance.\nViruses generally mutate over time, creating new variants. When a new variant grows in a population, it's labeled as an \"emerging variant\".\nSome of the potential consequences of emerging variants are the following:\nNotable variants.\nCluster 5.\nIn early November 2020, Cluster 5, also referred to as \u0394FVI-spike by the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI), was discovered in Northern Jutland, Denmark, and is believed to have been spread from minks to humans via mink farms. On 4 November 2020, it was announced that the mink population in Denmark would be culled to prevent the possible spread of this mutation and reduce the risk of new mutations happening. A lockdown and travel restrictions were introduced in seven municipalities of Northern Jutland to prevent the mutation from spreading, which could compromise national or international responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. By 5 November 2020, some 214 mink-related human cases had been detected.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that cluster 5 has a \"moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies\". SSI warned that the mutation could reduce the effect of COVID-19 vaccines under development, although it was unlikely to render them useless. Following the lockdown and mass-testing, SSI announced on 19 November 2020 that cluster 5 in all probability had become extinct. As of 1 February 2021, authors to a peer-reviewed paper, all of whom were from the SSI, assessed that cluster 5 was not in circulation in the human population.\nLineage B.1.1.7 / Variant of Concern 20DEC-01.\nThis variant was first detected in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom from a sample taken the month before in Kent. Lineage B.1.1.7, It's correlated with a big increase in COVID-19 infection in United Kingdom, partly because of the N501Y mutation. There is some evidence that this variant has 40%\u201380% increased transmissibility and an increase in deadliness.\nVariant of Concern 21FEB-02.\nVariant of Concern 21FEB-02 (previously written as VOC-202102/02), described by Public Health England (PHE) as \"B.1.1.7 with E484K\" is the B.1.1.7 variant with an additional E484K mutation. As of 17 March 2021, there are 39 confirmed cases of VOC-21FEB-02 in the UK. On 4 March 2021, scientists reported B.1.1.7 with E484K mutations in the state of Oregon. It seems that this combination happened randomly in Oregon, instead of coming from the UK.\nLineage B.1.1.317.\nB.1.1.317 is not a variant of concern, but Queensland Health forced 2 people in hotel quarantine in Brisbane, Australia to go through an extra 5 days quarantine on top of the mandatory 14 days after it was confirmed they were infected with this variant.\nLineage B.1.1.318.\nLineage B.1.1.318 was detected on 24 February 2021. 16 cases of it have been detected in the UK.\nLineage B.1.351.\nOn 18 December 2020, the 501.V2 variant, also known as 501.V2, 20H/501Y.V2 (formerly 20C/501Y.V2), VOC-20DEC-02 (formerly VOC-202012/02), or lineage B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa and reported by the country's health department. Researchers and officials reported that the variant is more likely to make young people very sick. The South African health department also said that the variant may be driving the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country.\nScientists said that the variant has many mutations that allow it to attach more easily to human cells because of the following three mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike glycoprotein of the virus: N501Y, K417N, and E484K. The N501Y mutation has also been detected in the United Kingdom.\nLineage B.1.429 / CAL.20C.\nLineage B.1.429, also known as CAL.20C, has by five distinct mutations (I4205V and D1183Y in the ORF1ab-gene, and S13I, W152C, L452R in the spike proteins S-gene). B.1.429 might be more transmissible. The CDC has listed B.1.429 and the related B.1.427 as \"variants of concern,\" and says that they have a ~20% increase in transmissibility.\nB.1.429 was first discovered in July 2020 by researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, California, in one of 1,230 virus samples collected in Los Angeles County since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic. It wasn't detected again until September when it reappeared among samples in California, but numbers remained very low until November. In November 2020, the CAL.20C variant accounted for 36 percent of samples collected at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and by January 2021, the CAL.20C variant was 50 percent of samples.\nLineage B.1.525.\nB.1.525, also called VUI-21FEB-03 (previously VUI-202102/03) by Public Health England (PHE) and formerly known as UK1188, doesn't have the same N501Y mutation found in B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P.1, but has the same E484K-mutation as found in the P.1, P.2, and 501.V2 variants. B.1.525 is different from all other variants by having both the E484K-mutation and a new F888L mutation. As of March 5, it had been found in 23 countries, including the UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Nigeria, Ghana, Jordan, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Malaysia, Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland and the US.\nLineage P.1.\nLineage P.1, termed Variant of Concern 21JAN-02 (formerly VOC-202101/02) by Public Health England and 20J/501Y.V3 by Nextstrain, was found in Tokyo on 6 January 2021 by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). The new lineage was first identified in four people who arrived in Tokyo having travelled from the Brazilian Amazonas state on 2 January 2021. On 12 January 2021, the Brazil-UK CADDE Centre confirmed 13 local cases of the P.1 new lineage in the Amazon rain forest. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been named P.1 lineage (although it is a descendant of B.1.1.28, the name B.1.1.28.1 is not permitted and thus the resultant name is P.1), and has 17 unique amino acid changes, 10 of which in its spike protein, including the three concerning mutations: N501Y, E484K and K417T.\nA study of samples from Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, showed the P.1 lineage to be 1.4\u20132.2 times more transmissible. The variant is also 10\u201380% more deadly.\nA vaccinated person has a higher risk of getting a mild P.1 infection while still being 100% protected against hospitalisation or death.\nPreliminary data from two studies indicate that the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine is effective against the P.1 variant, although the exact level of efficacy has not yet been released. Preliminary data from a study conducted by Instituto Butantan suggest that CoronaVac is effective against the P.1 variant as well, and the study will be expanded to obtain definitive data."}

It is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and is meant to be used with the 77 grain version MK-262. It has an 18\" barrel giving it much more range capabilities than the M4 and the 77 grain MK-262 gave it more range capabilities than the M16. The rifle has a maximum effective range of 700 meters or 770 yards while the M4 has 500 meters and the M16 has 550 meters. It was issued with a Leupold MK-4 2.5-8x36mm scope that was specifically calibrated for the 77 grain ammunition on an 18\" barrel. Some MK-12 rifles had a standard A2 stock found on M16 rifles and some had collapsible crane stocks found on MK-18 and M4 rifles. It had a free-float hand rail which gave it superior accuracy by having the barrel completely unaffected by the hand rail.

When becoming conscious again (\"waking up\"), people often have a euphoric feeling, or a good dream. Most of the time, adolescents try this game. One of the reasons is that they want to experiment with other states of consciousness. If they do it as a group, peer pressure often plays a role. The practice seems to have started in France, in the early 20th century. After the second world war (late 1940s, to early 1950s), several authors described it.\nThe reasons to play this game are different from those of erotic asphyxiation. Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, claims that children and teens try the game mainly \"to get a high without taking drugs.\" Children \"aren't playing this game for sexual gratification.\" It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal. Unlike erotic asphyxiation, adults usually don't play this game. \nDangers and effects.\nThe brain will take permanent damage, if it doesn't get enough oxygen. The first effects occur within minutes. \nIn the United States, and in France, where it is known as \"jeu de foulard\", this practice has caused several deaths. The CDC has identified 82 victims aged between 6 and 19 years, who died as a result of this practice, between 1995 and 2007.\nMost of the sensations felt are:\nAccording to Fran\u00e7oise Cochet, successfully preventing children from playing is to not only telling them that playing the game is dangerous, but also telling them about the risks involved.\nStatistics.\nThe French government organised a conference on the subject, where experts from France and Belgium took part. Afterwards, a study was done, where 1012 children between 6 and 15 years of age, were questioned. The study found the following results:"}

Legend says that Sui is totally black, except for its colorless, transparent hands. Sui\u2014according to the said legend\u2014appears every Chinese New Year\u2019s eve and would touch a sleeping child\u2019s head, causing mental illness.\nThis is why Chinese New Year celebration is practiced by staying up late during the new year\u2019s eve, called \"Shousui\" or translated as \u201cwaiting for Sui\u201d.\nSo, the elderly people started to thread coins with a red string, called \"ya sui qian\" or \u201cmoney to suppress Sui\u201d. The coins were given to children to entertain them, and to keep them awake to avoid \"Sui\"\u2019s touch.\nAccording to the same legend, eight noble fairies turned themselves into eight coins, protecting the children from \"Sui.\" Thus, the story spread and everyone started to follow the same practice to protect the children.

Because the department was a part of the government, Congress had to approve most things that happened to it. This made change to the Postal Office Department very slow, and this did not sit well with the Postal Unions.

Now that they were an independent agency, they did not receive money from Congress, so they had to work to make money through the selling of stamps and shipping.\nAnother was their new way of choosing the Postmaster General.

He was born and raised in Morocco and emigrated to the United States with his family when he was 13. He is the founder of Coke Boys Records and its predecessor Cocaine City Records.\nKharbouch released his debut mixtape in 2007. It was called \"French Revolution Vol. 1\". He had his first breakthrough with the single \"Choppa Choppa Down\" in 2010. He released his debut studio album \"Excuse My French\" in May 2013. In July 2017, Montana released his second studio album, \"Jungle Rules.\" That album peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album was supported by the single \"Unforgettable\", featuring Swae Lee, which became Montana's first song as lead artist to reach the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nEarly life.\nKarim Kharbouch was born on November 9, 1984, in Casablanca, Morocco. He also lived in Casablanca for the first 13 years of his life. His favorite hobbies growing up were soccer and rap, and he got into basketball in his later teenage years.\nIn the mid-1990s, Kharbouch left Morocco with his parents and younger brother for New York City. They settled in the South Bronx. Kharbouch spoke only his native languages of Moroccan Darija and French when he first arrived, and learned English in the Bronx high schools of Lehman and Roosevelt. After struggling for two years, his father decided they would move back to Casablanca, but his mother chose to stay back with their children because she believed there was a lack of opportunity back home in Morocco. His mother was pregnant with his youngest brother at the time. He was born in the United States shortly after his father left for Morocco. With three children and low money, his mother had to depend on welfare for financial support.\nPersonal life.\nMontana is fluent in his native Arabic and French as well as in English. Montana has lived in Pompton Plains, New Jersey. In 2016, he bought Selena Gomez's Calabasas, California home for $3.3 million. Montana is Muslim, and follows Ramadan. \nMontana married Deen Kharbouch in 2007. The couple had separated by 2012, and their divorce was finalized in 2014 for around $2 million. They have a son who was born in October 2010, named Kruz. Montana started dating Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian in June 2014. They broke up in September 2014. \nIn June 2018, Montana became a U.S. citizen."}

The \"Post-\" in Post-structuralism means \"comes after.\" \"Structuralism\" is another kind of philosophy. Most of post-structuralism is about saying that structuralism is wrong.\nThe people we call Post-structuralists who wrote about structuralism all had different ideas. A common idea among them was not liking how some structuralists thought the whole world could be thought of as symbols that are opposite to each other. They thought that things in life and in media are more complex than that, so that thinking \"this is the opposite of that\" was silly. A lot of the time, the post-structuralists said that the things that we think of as the ends of a binary were really made up by other people, and were not really useful or true.\n\"Structuralism\" says that we can see human culture as a structure that looks like language. It also says that this is not reality, but we can use a \"third order\" that makes a bridge between the two. A post-structuralist might say that to build meaning out of that, you have to make a mistake and think that the definitions of things are good and don't change. Post-structualists might also say that the structuralist theory is above and not a part of from these structures they are writing things about.\nPost-structuralist writers write about how structuralism is too stiff and is wrong to put things in categories.\nWriters that have been called post-structuralists include: Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler, Jean Baudrillard and Julia Kristeva, although some did not want to be called \"post-structuralist.\""}

It worked from Minsk. The radio station used the frequency 105.1 MHz. It worked from August 7, 1992 to January 12, 2011. \nHistory.\nFrom the start of the 1990s to January 1, 1995, Autoradio was heard on the frequency 67.7 OIRT FM. Autoradio used OIRT FM (the International Radio and Television Organisation wave in the air). It was the only open range for people and organizations in Belarus at that time. In 1995, the radio station was cut. It took four years to get back on the air. In 2001, the second wave line was started on the FM frequency 105.1 MHz (Megahertz). \nBelarusian music was heard on the radio. Groups N.R.M., Krambambula, Lyapis Trubetskoy, Neuro Dubel, and the best songs from the Tuzin.fm website selection were heard the most. Famous people worked for the radio station, such as Oleg Khomenko, Dzmitryj Wajciuszkiewicz, and Masha Yar.\nIn September 2009, the Ministry of Information of the Republic of Belarus penciled a punishment for Autoradio for broadcasting the EuroZoom show made together with European Radio for Belarus.\nEnd of broadcasting.\nAt 12:40 on January 12, 2011, the Autoradio's broadcasting document was taken away and the radio station saw its end. The Republican Commission on Television and Radio Broadcasting led by Oleg Proleskovsky took the Autoradio's broadcasting document away after the station broadcast advertisements for candidates Andrei Sannikov and Uladzimir Nyaklyayew.

Levine and Minkoff (Minkoff is a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team.

The writer of the article wanted a group name other than \"The Application Software Programmers,\" so he thought of \"The Blue Sky Rangers\". This was based on the programming group's \"Blue Sky Meetings,\" which were a series of sessions to make new game ideas.\nOne of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, has owned the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on multiple computer and video game platforms, as well as mobile phones.

At one time, the Krupp company was the biggest maker of weapons in the world.\nKrupp was born in 1907 in Essen, Germany. He joined the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933. The Krupp company pretended to make farm equipment but they were really making tanks. They moved and rebuilt factories. Some of the workers in the factories were enslaved people from concentration camps in the Holocaust. Historians say there were 100,000 slaved workers and as many as 70,000 of them died.\nHistorian Harold James says that Alfried Krupp only became leader of the company in 1943, after all the enslaving had happened, and that he was a scapegoat for the company's bad actions. Krupp was put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. He was sentenced to 12 years, but he was pardoned in 1951."}

This makes one helium nucleus, one neutron, and 17.6 mega electronvolts of energy.\nHow to get deuterium and tritium.\nDeuterium is easy to find in seawater. 1 in 5000 hydrogen atoms are deuterium. However, tritium is a radioactive isotope. If lithium is exposed to neutrons with much energy, tritium is produced. The deuterium\u2013tritium reaction also produces one neutron. In fusion reactors, a 'breeding blanket' is used where the walls of the fusion reactor have lithium on them. This way, the neutrons produced from fusion will hit the lithium and produce more tritium."}

They were formed in Manchester, England in 1973.\nTheir story is told in CP Lee's book \"When We Were Thin\" (2007 by Hotun Press). The name of the band is a corruption of the Latin American band \"Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos\".\nCareer.\nCreated in 1973 by Chris \"C.P.\" Lee, with Jimmy Hibbert (vocals, bass) and Bob Harding (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), the comedy sketch outfit became a musical group in 1974 and was joined by drummer Bruce Mitchell (drums), with Les Prior (vocals), Simon White (steel guitar, guitar) and Tony Bowers (vocals, bass, guitar). They became a popular support act, supporting Hawkwind on their 1975 tour. The group mercilessly parodied the major rock names of the 1970s \u2013 \"Anadin\" was a sendup of Lou Reed's \"Heroin\". By 1976 they were topping the bill in their own right and were supported by such acts as The Police, The Cure, The Stranglers, Devo, Ian Dury and The Blockheads, The Buzzcocks, Dr. Feelgood and Blondie. They were promoted by Freddie Mercury and Bryan Ferry. As with many comedy ensembles, the Albertos belied their comic aspirations by their exemplary musicianship, and they released four albums and a variety of spoof discs, culminating in the musical play, \"Snuff Rock\".\n\"Sleak (aka Snuff Rock)\", inspired by the then recent film, \"Snuff\", and the concept of snuff movies, but carrying the idea to a band who killed themselves for entertainment, was their musical play presented at London's Royal Court Theatre and Round House and was famous for the role of the comic disc jockey played by Les Prior. They reached the UK Singles Chart with the accompanying EP, \"Snuff Rock\", released on Stiff Records, poked fun at the punk rock phenomenon, targeting the Sex Pistols (\"Gobbing On Life\"), The Damned (\"Kill\") and The Clash (\"Snuffin' Like That\") as well as myriad reggae bands in \"Snuffin' In A Babylon\". Tony Bowers and Bob Harding left the band in July 29, 1978, they were replaced by John Scott (vocals, bass, guitar, saxophone, keyboards) (ex John Cooper Clarke and Jilted John) and Ged Green (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) in August 24, 1978. They reached the UK Singles Chart with the Status Quo spoof, \"Heads Down No Nonsense Mindless Boogie\" in 1978. Les Prior died in January 1980 from leukaemia, which left a large gap in the group. Ged Green left the band in March 27, 1980, he was replaced by Ian Morris (\"Mog\") (vocals, bass) (ex The Smirks) in March 28, 1980.\nAfter their nationally networked TV show \"Teach Yourself Gibberish\" and a crack at America with \"Sleak\", the Albertos disbanded in 1982.\nThe band's brand of spoof rock has been said to be in the same English tradition as that of the Barron Knights and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, but a better comparison might be the American parody singer Weird Al Yankovic."}

For this reason, Turkish coffee is sometimes called Mocca. \nSimilar versions are also made in Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Greece, Armenia and the Balkans.\nHistory.\nTurkish coffee first appeared in the Ottoman Empire. The coffee was considered a drug and it was forbidden to drink it. But, because it was very popular the sultan eventually lifted this prohibition.\nTurkish coffee had reached Britain and France by the 17th century. The first coffee house in Britain was opened by an Ottoman Jew in the mid 17th century.\nHow to make Turkish coffee.\nTo make Turkish coffee, ground coffee beans are used. The ground coffee beans is mixed with water and boiled. It is boiled in a special pot called \"cezve\" in Turkey. After it boils it is taken off the heat and served. The coffee is traditionally served in a small porcelain cup called a \"kahve fincan\u0131\" 'coffee cup'. Sometimes sugar is added to the coffee to make it taste sweet."}

The three deities are Mangang Sitapa, Luwang Sitapa and Khuman Sitapa. They are also regarded as the progenitors of the Mangang dynasty, the Luwang dynasty and the Khuman dynasty, the three of the seven ruling clan dynasties of Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur).\nMangang, Luwang and Khuman were distinguished by the passionate love for God and self abnegation. This feeling of self effacing love for God as the only ultimate means of realisation and salvation formed the basis of early Meitei religion.\nThey are represented by the specific divisions of a body, Mangang by head, Luwang by torso and Khuman by tail.\nDuring the Hinduinisation of the entire Meitei ethnicity in the 18th century AD, the ideology and concepts of these three deities were mingled up with some Hindu elements. They were made equivalents to three of the nine Hindu Gotras, Mangang with \"Aitereya\", Luwang with \"Kashyap\" and Khuman with \"Madhugalya\". With the addition of the Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) term \"Guru\" to each name of the three deities, they were mentioned in the evening prayers, as Mangang Guru, Luwang Guru and Khuman Guru."}

It is made of a banana duct taped to a wall. Three editions of the art were made. Two of them were sold for $120,000. \nHistory.\nMaurizio Cattelan is known for making strange art. His sculpture \"America\" is a working golden toilet. He has used duct tape before by taping a person on a wall for an art gallery. He bought the banana used in \"Comedian\" for about 30 cents. Emmanuel Perrotin was the exhibitor of \"Comedian\". He said it has many meanings and is a good way to show humor. It was the first time in more than 15 years that Cattelan's art was shown in an exhibition.\nReception.\nSome people did not think it should really be called art. \"The Guardian\" said it was a \"questionably genius work\". They said the price of the art reminded them of a joke in the sitcom \"Arrested Development\" about not knowing how much a banana costs. \"Artnet News\" said it was one of the worst works of art for the week. They thought that the price was foolish. \"USA Today\" made jokes about the art's price. \"Newsweek\" called it \"humorous\" and \"minimalist\" (art that uses simple ideas). CBS News said it was \"the most talked-about\" work of art at the gallery. \"Comedian\" was put on the cover of \"The New York Post\" for a day.\nPurchases.\nThree editions of the art were made. Two of them were bought at the art gallery Art Basel for $120,000. This got the attention of mass media. One of the editions was bought by Sara Andelman (a founder of a fashion shop). Another was bought by Billy and Beatrice Cox. They said that they knew some people thought it would be foolish to buy it. They bought it because they said it would be \"\" and \"historical\". It came with a certificate to show that it is the real art. \nIntervention.\nArtist David Datuna ate one of the editions at the Art Basel. He called his intervention \"Hungry Artist\". A new banana was used after that. No legal complaints were made, but Datuna was told to leave the gallery. He said that anything done to the art can be art itself. \"I am a hungry artist, and I am hungry for new interactions.\"\nMeanings.\nSome people tried to think of what the art could mean, while others did not think it was serious. Artist Sebastian Errazuriz duct taped a dildo on a wall and tried to get $12,000 from it. CryptoGraffiti made jokes on trying to find bitcoin keys in bananas. Brooke Shields taped a banana on her forehead and put it on Instagram with the text \"An expensive selfie\". Design Simon Porte Jacquemus made an image of a bag he designed with tape on it. Many other companies made images of their products being taped.\nRemoval.\n\"Comedian\" was taken out of the art gallery on December 8, 2019. Curators did this because they thought people would harm other works of art at the gallery. They made an apology for those that wanted to see it. Emmanuel Perrotin made an account on social media about \"Comedian\" after that. One of the walls that had the art was vandalized with the text \"Epstein didn't kill himself\"."}

It has been protected as a national park since 1998. The mountain is in Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar.\nTakashi Ozaki (Japan, 1951 \u2013 May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka \"Aung Tse\"; Myanmar) made the first ascent in 1996. As of 2021, they were the only people to have reached the top of the mountain and to have returned alive. Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but turned back due to bad weather. The route to basecamp is long (four weeks). A dense rain forest needs to be traversed, with many unbridged stream crossings. Before 1993, foreigners were not allowed travel to the area. This may be one of the reasons why the first successful climb was only done recently.\nIn 2013, the nearby peak of Gamlang Razi was climbed and measured at using an advanced version of GPS, making it possibly the highest in Myanmar. Ozaki had confirmed Hkakabo's height as 5881 m, but he did not yet have the GPS equipment to measure the exact height of Hkakabo Razi.\nA team was sent out, to measure the exact height, in 2014. They had to turn back at a height of . They estimated that the summit was higher. Therefore, its exact height is unknown."}

Usually, children are born after 40 weeks of pregnancy. Very few children are born before the mother reaches 24 weeks of pregnancy. If they are born alive, very few will survive. About 50 to 70 percent of children born from the 25th week of pregnancy will survive. In the 24th week, the survival chance is 30 to 50 percent. The point at which the child has a 50 percent chance of surviving is called limit of viability."}
