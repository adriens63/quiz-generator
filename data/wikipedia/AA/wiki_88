These tickets let people into a theater to see an event. In the movie industry, the term is most often used to mean the amount of money a movie makes by the selling of tickets. The term can also mean things which affect the amount a movie earns.\nUsage.\n\"Box office\" business can be measured in terms of how many people see a movie. It can also be measured by how much money is earned by selling tickets. The estimate of these amounts and analysis of them is very important to the movie industry. It is often something that is important to fans as well. \nSome people think that the movie industry is concerned too much with this. They say profit is more important to movie studios than making movies as a form of art. Understanding how different types of movies earn money affects the how other movies are made and paid for. If a certain type of movie often has a large box office, studios are more likely to make that type of movie. Some types of movies earn more when they are released at certain times of the year. Studios use this information to plan when to release certain movies. For example:\nThere are many websites that show box-office number. Two of these are ShowBIZ Data and Box Office Mojo. \nUsually, the movie's distributor gets more than half of the money earned. The rest is kept by the movie theater. The percentage is different from movie to movie. The distributor often gets a higher percentage in early weeks. As time passes, the percentage become lower and the theater keeps a larger part of the ticket sales. With some movies, the distributor may take all of the ticket sales for the first week. The theater earns its money by selling food and drinks. After several weeks nearly all of the ticket sales is kept by the theater. Because of this, only the first few weeks are very important to the movie studios. \nRelated movie industry terminology.\nThe following is movie industry specific terminology. It is defined by Box Office Mojo.\nFor movies released in North America, box office figures are usually divided into two categories. The first is domestic. This is the amount a movie earns in the United States and Canada. The second is foreign which includes all other countries. The Weekly box office is the amount a movie makes from Friday through Thursday. The \"movie week\" starts on Friday because most movies are released on that day. A large part of this is the weekend box office. It is defined as the amount earned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The first weekend after a movie is released is the opening weekend. The amount made by a movie on its opening weekend is what is often reported. \nTheaters is the number of theaters in which the movie is being shown. Because a theater may show a movie on more than one screens, the total number of screens is also used. If a movie is released in over 600 theaters, it is said to be wide release. If the number is less than 600, it is a limited release. A limited release may be as small as one theater or 1-2 theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, California. A movie may start with a limited release and later get a wide release. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" is an example of this."}

It is on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north.\nThe first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge. Although a stone bridge was planned, a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicles in 1772. The bridge was poorly designed. Iy was dangerous to its users and to passing shipping. Boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed, and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.\nAlthough dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge across the Thames in London. It was the subject of paintings by Turner, Cotman and Whistler.\nIn 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, and one of London's least busy Thames bridges. The position on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.\nIn June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames. The Battersea Bridge area marked the official start of the parade of ships and boats moving towards Tower Bridge."}

{"id": "336412", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336412", "title": "Saint", "text": "A saint is a holy person. In many religions, saints are people who are believed to be holy.\nIn Christianity, the word \"saint\" refers to any person who is \"in Christ\", and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or in earth. Orthodox Christians and Catholics teach that all Christians in Heaven are saints, but some are worthy of more honor than others.\nIn the Christian Bible, not only one person is actually called a saint: \"They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.\" () The apostle Paul called himself \"less than the least of all saints\" in .\nPaul's 2nd letter to the Corinthian Church speaks of ...all the saints in Achaia \nAlso to the saints in Ephesus as well as to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi\nGeneral characteristics.\nMany religions use the \"saint\" idea to honor people, like Hindu saints. If a person is considered a saint, no matter what religion they belong to, they are usually:\nChristianity.\nAnglicanism.\nIn the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, a Saint is a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be followed, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey (). Official Anglican policy recognizes the existence of the saints in heaven.\nEastern Orthodoxy.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven, whether recognized here on earth, or not. This means Adam and Eve, Moses, and the various prophets (except for the angels and archangels) are all given the title of \"Saint\". In the Orthodox Church, sainthood refers to closeness to God.\nLutheranism.\nIn the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors certain saints, including some saints honored by the Catholic Church.\nMethodism.\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not practice the patronage or veneration of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mostly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc.\nMormons (Latter-day Saints).\nThe beliefs within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with regard to saints are close to the beliefs of the Protestant faith. In the New Testament the saints are all those who have been baptized. \"Latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the \"latter days\", before the Second Coming of Christ. Therefore members are often referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"Saints\".\nOriental Orthodox.\nThe Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Armenian Apostolic Church do accept the existence of saints, but officially recognize them in their own ways. For example, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria canonizes saints, through the approval of that church's Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a saint's death to his canonization, and the Coptic Orthodox Pope must follow that rule.\nOther Christian groups.\nThere are some groups who do not accept the idea of the Communion of Saints. Some believe all of the departed are in soul sleep until the final resurrection on Judgment Day. Others believe that the departed go to either Paradise or Tartarus, to await the day in which the living and the dead are judged. Certain groups do not believe that the departed have any connection with the living.\nProtestantism.\nIn many Protestant churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this way, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (any Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider prayers to the saints to be idolatry because they believe prayers should be given only to God himself.\nRoman Catholicism.\nOne Roman Catholic website says that \"There are over 10,000 named saints and beatified people from history, the Roman Martyrology and Orthodox sources, but no definitive head count\".\nRev. Alban Butler published \"Lives of the Saints\" in 1756, containing 1,486 saints. The latest edition of this work contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Monsignor Robert Sarno, an official of Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, said it is impossible to say the exact number of saints.\nThe Catholic Church teaches that it does not make anyone into a saint. Instead, it recognizes a saint. In the Church, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been canonized (officially recognized) by the Catholic Church, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven.\nBecause the Church believes all people in Heaven are saints, there are many people believed to be in Heaven who have not been officially declared as saints. Sometimes the word \"saint\" is used to refer to Christians still living here on earth.\nThe veneration of saints, in Latin, \"cultus\", or the \"cult of the saints\", describes devotion to a particular saint or saints. Sometimes this is called \"worship\", but only in the old-sense meaning \"to honor or give respect\". According to the Catholic Church, Divine Worship is properly reserved only for God and never to the saints. Saints can be asked for help, just as one can ask someone on earth to pray for them.\nA saint may be a patron saint of a cause or profession, or invoked against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official statements of the Magisterium. Saints are not thought to have power of their own, but only that granted by God.\nBecoming a Saint.\nA person who is seen as very holy can be declared a saint by a formal process, called canonization. Formal canonization is a lengthy process often taking many years, even centuries. The first step in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life, undertaken by an expert. After this, the report on the candidate is given to the bishop of the area and more studying is done. It is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.\nIf the application is approved, the person may be granted the title of \"Venerable\". Further investigations may lead to the candidate's beatification and given title of \"Blessed\". At least two important miracles are required to be formally declared a saint. These miracles must have happened after the candidate died. Finally, when all of this is done the Pope canonizes the saint.\nOnce a person has been declared a saint, the body of the saint is considered holy. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a symbol that represents their life.\nOther religions.\nThe word \"saint\" is not only used by Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized as having reached the highest goals of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions.\nAfrican Diaspora.\nCuban Santer\u00eda, Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name \"santer\u00eda\" was originally a negative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhists hold the Arhats and Arahants in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.\nDiscordianism.\nIn Discordianism, anyone, living or dead, or even anything can be named a saint. Anyone may canonize anything or anyone else as everyone, whether they are aware of it or not, is a pope in the POEE. This is because \"moral perfection isn't necessary for Discordian Sainthood. You just have to suffer a lot.\"\nHinduism.\nThere are people who have been described as being Hindu saints, most of whom have also been more specifically identified by the terms Sant, Mahatma, Paramahamsa, or Swami, or with the titles \"Sri\" or \"Srila\".\nIslam.\nThe Arabic word \"wali\" (Arabic \u0648\u0644\u064a, plural Awliy\u0101' \u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0621) is usually translated into English as \"Saint\". However, the \"wali\" should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. An important early scholar of Sunni Islamic beliefs, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi, mentioned in his book \"Al-Aqidah At-Tahawiya\":\n\"We do not prefer any of the saintly men among the Ummah over any of the Prophets but rather we say that any one of the Prophets is better than all the awliya' put together. We believe in what we know of Karamat, the marvels of the awliya' and in authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources.\nUnlike Prophets and Messengers, the \"awliya\" can be either male and female. One of the best known female saints is Rabi`a al-Adawiyya.\nIt is widely regarded in Islam that the saints of saints is Ali Ibn Abi Talib the cousin of Muhammad all Sufi orders originate through his teachings. In addition all saints regard him as their champion 'The Saints of Saints'\nIn Sufism, the major \"wali\" are considered to have been masters in the art of spiritual purification. Some groups within Islam hold the Hadrat (literally, Presence, a title of Sufi saints) in esteem.\nJudaism.\nThe word \"Tzadik\" \"righteous\", and its associated meanings, developed in Rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with \"Hasid\" (\"Pious\" honorific), to its exploration in Ethical literature, and its spiritualisation in Kabbalah. In Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance.\nSikhism.\nThe concept of sant or bhagat is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Nanak, and others are widely regarded as belonging to the Sant tradition. Some of their mystical compositions are incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term \"Sant\" is still sometimes loosely applied to living individuals in the Sikh and related communities."}

It is used to describe unlike objects or people. One of the most well-known bits of popular wisdom in the English-speaking world is that apples and oranges cannot be compared. The ability to tell apples from oranges is learned.\nThe phrase is almost always used along with a warning that things in different categories cannot be compared, or that the comparison is improper.\nHistory.\nThis idiom began as a comparison of \"apples and oysters\" in a book of proverbs published in 1670. This idiom has become a marker in English-speaking culture. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.\nVariants.\nThe idiom is not uniquely English.\nIn French-speaking Quebec, the idiom is \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), In Europe, the French idiom is \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears).\nIn Latin America, the Spanish idiom is \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples).\nIn British English, the phrase \"chalk and cheese\" means the same thing as \"apples and oranges\".\nComparison.\nIn order to compare anything, there needs to be a theory to be proven and framework for testing the theory. Three basic questions come first:\nScientific research.\nThe idiom has inspired scientific research projects. For example, the \"British Medical Journal\" published a study of red delicious apples compared with navel oranges. They were found to have many similarities.\nThere are differences in nutritional value.\nExperiments at NASA Ames Research Center showed that apples and oranges decay at similar rates."}

They are also usually more brittle which means they do not bend much but can shatter. Hard materials are used in cutting tools, machines and construction materials and other industrial goods. \nHardness tests are important in materials science. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness tests the hardness of minerals. The Brinell scale and various compression tests and rebound tests are more used for metals and artificial materials. "}

'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Born in Winterville, Mississippi, Lance moved to Chicago as a kid and became friends with Otis Leavill Cobb. Both of them took boxing and also worked at a drug store.\nAlthough he was arrested a couple of times in his life and his earliest records were not successful, Lance was most known for his music hits in the United States called \"Monkey Time\" and \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\". He was considered the most successful Okeh artist. After these hits, he became an iconic figure in Britain, where he lived throughout in the 1970s, among followers of Northern soul.\nLance continued to tour and perform at clubs and music festivals, such as in the United Kingdom and England, until he died in 1994 from a certain heart attack at the age of 55. Lance is buried in Homewood, Illinois.\nEarly Days.\nMajor Lance was born in Winterville, Mississippi. There has been something confusing over Lance's birth year; some sources say he was born 1941 or 1942 (as Lance claimed), while his gravestone states he was born in 1939. 'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Major Lance was one of 12 children. One of his hobbies was playing Baseball.\nLance moved with his family on the northwest side of Chicago in the Cabrini-Green projects, where there was a lot of crime in the area, as a child. After moving to Chicago, he developed a boyhood friendship with another singer named Otis Leavill Cobb. They both attended Wells High School. This was the same school Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler, who were also both singers too, went to. Mayfield called him a \"sparkly fellow, and a great basketball player, which is probably how we met. His hero was Jackie Wilson, and he was always coming round and looking through my bag for songs that I'd written but didn't want to do with the Impressions. He was pretty good at picking them, too.\" Lance and Otis both toke boxing and were also singing as members of the Five Gospel Harmonaires. Both of them also worked together at a drug store.\nCareer.\nLance and Otis Leavill formed a group named the Floats in the mid-1950s. However, they broke up before recording any songs. But Lance became a featured dancer on a local TV show named \"Time for Teens\", and presenter Jim Lounsbury gave him a one-off record deal with Mercury Records. Mercury released his single \"I Got a Girl\", written and produced by Curtis Mayfield, in 1959, which was not successful. Because of this, Lance worked at various jobs over the next few years.\nLance signed with OKeh Records in 1962 as Curtis Mayfield recommended. Major was constantly showing up at the Okeh offices, offering to run errands for Carl Davis, telling him about the record he'd once made and how he and Curtis Mayfield were friends from their childhood. Major Lance's first single was called \"Delilah\", which was made by Curtis Mayfield. Although it was not successful, it made his partnership with a writing and arranging team for Curtis Mayfield, Carl Davis, and Johnny Pate, often with members of Mayfield's music group called The Impressions on backing vocals. Together they made a distinctive, Latin-tinged sound which epitomised Chicago soul unlike other music.\nMajor Lance's second Okeh single was called \"The Monkey Time\". This song was also written by Mayfield. Unlike his first Okeh single, Monkey Time was a success, becoming #2 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart. It was also the #8 pop hit in 1963. \"The Monkey Time\" became Okeh's first hit single for 10 years.\nHis hits quickly became more successful, including \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\" (his biggest hit, reaching #5 in the US pop chart and #40 in the UK, where it was his only chart success. It was also one of the top 100 on the Billboard chart in 1964), \"The Matador\" (the only one not written by Mayfield), \"Rhythm\", \"Sometimes I Wonder\", \"Come See\", and \"Ain't It A Shame\".\nLance and Davis continued to work together, during the time Pate and Mayfield left Okeh Records. \"Too Hot To Hold\" was a minor hit, but they had poor success before Davis left the company in turn. During this period, Lance toured in the United Kingdom. This is where he was supported by Bluesology, a band including pianist Reggie Dwight (Reggie was later known as Elton John.). Over the next two years he began working with several music producers. Soon after Lance left OKeh Records in 1968 and moved to Dakar Records, where he had the Top 40 R&amp;B hit \"Follow the Leader.\" He then moved to Mayfield's label named Curtom Records, which resulted in his last two Top 40 R&amp;B hits, \"Stay Away From Me (I Love You too Much)\" and \"Must Be Love Coming Down.\" One of Lance's song recorded at Curtom called \"Stay Away From Me\" was listed #4 in Jet Magazine's \"Soul Brothers Top 20\". He left Curtom in 1971, and recorded for Volt and Columbia Records labels for a short amount of time.\nLance moved to England in 1972. He was to become \"legendary as a UK club act, known to deliver 110% at every performance.\" During his time in England, he recorded an album, \"Major Lance's Greatest Hits Recorded Live At The Torch\", recorded at The Torch, a club in Stoke-on-Trent, which has been described as \"perhaps the best Northern Soul album ever made\". Lance returned to Atlanta in 1974. He recorded an updated disco version of \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\" for Playboy Records. He set up a new label, Osiris, with Al Jackson, a former drummer for Booker T and the MG, but again with little success, and his songs became less popular. But later found that his recordings had become popular on the beach music circuit in the Carolinas, where he continued to perform at live performances. He recorded a comeback album, \"The Major's Back\", and several tracks for the Kat Family label.\nPersonal life.\nMajor Lance was married to Christine Boular Lance, and had nine children. He was 6'6\u00a0foot tall.\nLance was arrested two times in his life. In 1965, Lance was arrested in violation of the Paternity Act. A Chicago Women, Para Lee Thomas, told she had a son named \"Ronnie Maurice Lance\" (born ). She declared Lance who promised to pay her doctor and hospital bills around $375, but defaulted in the payment. Judge Benjamin J. Kanter issued for the arrest, setting Lance's bond at $1,000. After recording briefly for the Motown Records subsidiary label Soul in 1978, he was convicted of cocaine possession and was sentenced to four years in Jail.\nIn 1987, Lance was diagnosed with a heart attack, and he became nearly blind from glaucoma. As a result, he made no more recordings since. In June 1994, he gave his final performance at the 11th Chicago Blues Festival. In September of that year, he died in his sleep at the age of 55 of heart disease in Decatur, Georgia. He was survived by his family. He is buried at Washington Memory Gardens Cemetery in Homewood, Illinois."}

While Quinn is driving back to New York City, her car is hit by a truck.\nDevelopment.\nCasting and creation.\nRachel is portrayed by Lea Michele. Younger Rachel has been played by Lauren Boles. When Ryan Murphy was casting for \"Glee\", he wanted actors who could take on theatrical roles. Murphy did not want to do network casting calls. He instead, spent three months on Broadway. He found Michele, who was starring in \"Spring Awakening\". The role of Rachel was written just for Michele. In an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Michele commented on her casting, saying: \"I was kind of just thrown into this\u2014this is one of the first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing\u2014she performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience.\"\nIn December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of \"Glee\" would be replaced. He stated that the replacements would happen at the end of the third season. Which would be around the time when they graduate. Murphy said: \"Every year we're going to add a new group [of people]. There's nothing more sad than a high schooler with a bald spot.\" He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: \"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\" Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving. Michele commented on this, saying: \"We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!\" However, Falchuk later stated that Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith will graduate at the end of the third season. He also said: \"because they're (they are) graduating doesn't mean they're (they are) leaving the show.\" Falchuk also said: \"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go\u2026. They are not done with the show after this season.\"\nSandra Gonzalez of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented on the news about the cast leaving. She said: \"Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on \"Friday Night Lights\", which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood (group) didn't (did not) try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. \"Glee\" could learn a lot from what \"Friday Night Lights\" accomplished (have done successfully): a seamless, realistic (real) transition (change). The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been \"Glee\"s strong points, which is not to say they couldn't (could not) be. But the question is: Is \"Glee\" looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of \"Friday Night Lights\"\u2026 or \"Saved By the Bell: The New Class\"?\"\nCharacterization.\nMichele took the role as Rachel because of her characterization. Michele explained: \"Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heart\u2014I think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are.\" Michele described the first thirteen episodes of \"Glee\". She described it as: \"Rachel's journey of finding herself within the glee club\". She also said that \"she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's (who is) sometimes a little misunderstood.\"\n\"Glee\"s costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costumes. Eyrich told \"Entertainment Weekly\": \"Originally (at first), the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from \"Election\"\u2014very buttoned-down (someone who is serious in the job they are doing), preppy (someone who looks like a high school student), obnoxious (not very well liked by people), squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen (television) and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong.\"\nMichele have stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She also gets inspiration from the movie \"Election\", and \"Gossip Girl\" character Blair Waldorf. She has explained: \"[Blair] is shady (a mean person), but you still love her. She's still vulnerable (easy to get hurt). That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't (does not) matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't (will not) matter anyway.\"\nReception.\nCritical reviews.\nSome songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They were also on the soundtrack albums, \"Glee: The Music, Volume 1\" and \"Glee: The Music, Volume 2\". Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\" in 2010. She also was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\" in 2010. Robert A. George of the \"New York Post\" stated \"the only female [in Glee] who doesn't (does not) come across as manipulative (easy to tell someone what to do) or vapidly (nothing good about her) helpless\" (not able to help her own self). \"Chicago Tribune\"s Maureen Ryan wrote, \"Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled (get's whatever she wants in life) diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype.\" Denise Martin of \"The Los Angeles Times\" commented in her review of the episode \"The Rhodes Not Taken\": \"if there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel\".\nIn the episode \"Hairography\", Kurt Hummel gives Rachel a bad make over. Mike Hale of the \"New York Times\" remembered a popular theme that critics give negative reviews because of the way \"Glee\" treats its female characters. Hale said that he understands why, but also says that the show equally treats male characters the same. However, he wrote that \"it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic (really good).\" Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh commented: \"when we saw Rachel fall for them (Finn and Puck), she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A (best), uber-talented, self-involved (gets into things by herself) know-it-all (a person who believes they know everything) who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose (to show) a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nMichele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. Michele won the Satellite Awards for \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series\" in 2009. She also won, as part of the cast, for \"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2010, Michele won the NewNowNext Awards for \"Brink of Fame: Actor\". In 2009, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Awards in the category \"Choice TV Breakout Star\". That same year, Michele was nominated for a Golden Globe for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\". She also was nominated for an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\". She received another Teen Choice Award nomination in 2010 for \"Choice TV Actress: Comedy\". Michele was included in \"Time\" magazine's 2010 list of the \"100 Most Influential People In the World\". Her cover of The All-American Rejects' \"Gives You Hell\" reached the top 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Michele is featured as lead singer in 14 of the top 20 selling Glee Cast songs as of 2010. She won the 2012 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite TV Comedy Actress\".\nMichele was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011. The first for \"Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\" (\"Don't Stop Believin\"). The second for \"Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media\" (\"Glee: The Music, Volume 1\"). Michele said of the first Grammy nomination: \"I like that it's for 'Don't Stop Believin\", which is for the whole cast, so that we all get to go. That's just awesome.\" She was nominated again for \"Best Actress- Television Series Musical or Comedy\" at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. The cast of Glee was also nominated for the \"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\" award at the 2011 and 2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards."}

He was a minor god of androgeny, effeminacy and hermaphroditism. He also symbolized the unity of male and female. He was one of the members of the Erotes, a group of winged love gods. His name is the origin of the word hermaphrodite.\nMythology.\nAccording to a myth of Ovid, he was raised by nymphs in a cave on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen, he traveled to the cities of Lydia and Caria in Asia Minor. It was there that he came upon a pool of fresh water. He undressed and bathed in the pool. Meanwhile, the nymph of the pool Salmacis, fell in love with him. She jumped into the pool and embraced him, not letting go, he struggled to get away from her. Salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer, merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being. Hermaphroditus, in anger of his transformation, cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate.\nCult.\nThe worship of Hermaphroditus originated from Cyprus, under the name of Aphroditus. The cult was introduced into mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. At rituals and sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed; men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The god was also identified with the moon, because the moon was thought to be both male and female.\nArt.\nHermaphroditus was a popular subject in ancient Greek and Roman art. He is often shown alone and sometimes interacting with satyrs and cupids. There is a famous statue called \"The Sleeping Hermaphroditus\" at the Louvre Museum in Paris. "}

There were plans for a Dreamcast version of \"Max Payne\", but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.\nThe game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnar\u00f6k. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in \"The Matrix\".\n\"Max Payne\" got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices.

They began in the later Cambrian. \"Nautilus\" is the only surviving genus. \nNautiloids flourished during the early Palaeozoic era, when they were the main predatory animals. They developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known, though only a few species survive today.\nTaxonomic relationships.\nNautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods. The cephalopods are an advanced class of molluscs. The cephalopods also include ammonoids, Belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. \nTraditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea \"sensu lato\".\nCladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic group united by shared primitive (basal) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a evolutionary grade that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids. They are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthocerid nautiloids. \nThe ammonoids (a group which includes the ammonites and the goniatites) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids which evolved early in the Devonian, some 400 million years ago."}

The divinity was introduced into Greece and celebrated in Athens in a cross-dressing ritual.\nMythology.\nIt is thought that Hesiod's myth, explaining the birth of Aphrodite, born when Cronus cut off the genitals of Uranus and threw it into the sea, originated from the cult of Aphroditus. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC found at Perachora in Greece, representing Aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals, suggests this, as there are two different myths of the creation of Aphrodite.\nCult.\nAccording to Macrobius, Aphroditus was represented in Cyprus with a beard and phallus, wearing female clothing and holding a scepter. At sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The cult spread from Cyprus into southern Asia Minor, eventually reaching mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. In Athens, the iconography of the god took on the \"anasyromenos\" pose, a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus, a gesture that had apotropaic qualities, much like the god Priapus. By the Hellenistic period, the cult and votives had spread throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy.\nEvolution.\nGradually over time the cult lost popularity, Aphroditus was also being called Hermaphroditus, which originally meant Aphroditus in the form of a herm or \"a herm of Aphroditus\". These were marble or bronze sculptures with a head or torso above a plain rectangular pillar, a symbol of fertility. In later Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus came to be known as the son of Hermes and Aphrodite."}

Telomeres are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by the enzyme telomerase.\nThe function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. Every time the chromosome is copied 100\u2013200 meaningless nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. So, the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle, and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase. Telomerases carry their own RNA molecule, which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres.\nThe existence of a compensatory mechanism (a 'fix') for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973. He also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere's connections to cancer. \nTelomerase was discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate \"Tetrahymena\". Together with Jack Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery."}

Nurse, Hartwell and Hunt together discovered two proteins, cyclin and CDK (cyclin dependent kinase), which control the change from one stage to another. These proteins are called \"checkpoints\", because they check whether the cell has divided properly. If the cell does not divide correctly, other proteins will try to repair it. If that does not work, they will destroy the cell. If a cell divides incorrectly and survives, it may cause cancer and other serious diseases.\nWorking in baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"), Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle \u2013 the progression through G1."}

They have one seat, which is open to the air. They have aerodynamic wings on their front and rear, and the engine is positioned behind the driver. The regulations governing the cars are unique to the Formula One championship. The regulations say that cars must be built by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be done by others.\nTechnology.\nF1 Cars have technology to make them faster, more drag resistant and safer. Some of this technology is described below.\nERS.\nERS stand for Energy Recovery Systems. There are two basic types of ERS systems - mechanical and electrical and both recover energy without using fuel and damaging the environment. The rule to use KERS was introduced by the FIA in 2009. It works by storing energy in a flywheel or battery (like the one on the right) that would be lost when braking, and allow that energy to be re-used when accelerating. ERS was introduced in 2014 to activate wherever a driver chose permanently throughout a race weekend\nTraction Control.\nThis is used a lot in corners because it controls the wheel spin when under and over steering. They mean simply to which end of the car runs out of grip first as the tyres only have limited amount of grip. In an under steer, the front axle and wheels runs out of grip first and in Over steer the rear end runs out first. When this happens it is like a handbrake skid. Traction Control is the device that tries to keep the car stable by adjusting the wheel movement in these turns.\nDRS.\nDRS stands for Drag Reduction System. It is an addition to the rear wing of the car introduced in 2011 Formula 1 season aimed at reducing aerodynamic drag in order to promote overtaking. It is used when a driver is close to somebody in front of him. He will be able to open the rear wing so the car becomes more streamline and aerodynamic so he can overtake his opponent. The device is then disabled as soon as he overtakes his opponent.\nMaterials.\nFormula One teams do much research into materials. Below are list of materials used in the F1 world, what they are, what they do, where they're placed and why F1 teams choose them over everything else.\nCarbon fibre.\nCarbon fibre is a very strong and light material that contains carbon fibres. It may sometimes contain other fibres such as Kevlar, aluminium and glass. Although it has a very big price tag, its strength to weight ratio and the good rigidity of it make it a very valuable piece of material. However as is it gets cheaper it is being used in much smaller products like sports equipment, bodies for instruments and also household objects.\nCarbon fibre is most commonly used in the bodywork of an F1 car and also the air box, the wings, the engine cover, steering wheel and in the suspension. It is sometimes reinforced with titanium or steel.\nIt is used over every other kind of material because it\u2019s lightweight, very strong, very stiff and can easily be moulded into any shape. \nKevlar.\nKevlar is another fibre like carbon. Some of its properties are very similar. Kevlar is a very strong and lightweight material. If you have an equal amount of steel and Kevlar, Kevlar would be 5 times stronger than the steel. When it is woven, it is suitable to be underwater. Kevlar is also used by the army as it a very sturdy material and it is used to make a range of items like helmets.\nKevlar is used in pretty much the same areas as carbon fibre is used. For example it is used in the bodywork, the wings, the suspension and more.\nKevlar is an extremely firm material. As F1 cars go at high speed it adds extra protection to drivers and stops massive damage being done to the cars.\nAluminium.\nAluminium is an element. It is very light and hard. It is often used for ships so that ship doesn\u2019t get corroded and it is very stable due to its oxide coating. Aluminium is used in the bodywork and almost every single part of an F1 car. Aluminium is used because it is extremely light and very strong.\nMagnesium.\nMagnesium is another chemical element and is very light and strong. Its main use is to combine with aluminium to make alloys which are extremely light and strong, such as magnalium. It is used mainly in the wheels and some small parts in the engines.\nHydrodynamic gold foil.\nhydrodynamic gold foil is a type of foil which is gold coloured and stops heat from escaping. It is used between the engine and fuel tank. It is used in that certain position so it can stop heat transfer from the engine to the fuel tank."}

{"id": "336994", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336994", "title": "Structural isomer", "text": "A structural isomer or constitutional isomer of a compound is another compound whose molecule has the same number of atoms of each element, but with logically distinct bonds between them. The opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism. There are many words that represents structual isomers.\nThere are three kinds of constitutional isomers. They are skeletal isomers, positional isomers, and functional isomers. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers.\nSkeletal isomerism.\nIn skeletal isomerism, or chain isomerism, components of the skeleton (usually carbon) are re-ordered to make different structures. Pentane has three isomers. They are \"n\"-pentane (often called simply \"pentane\"), isopentane (methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane).\nPosition isomerism.\nIn position isomerism, a functional group or other substituent changes its position on a parent structure. In the table below, the hydroxyl group can stay in three different positions on an n-pentane chain to make three different compounds.\nMany aromatic isomers exist because substituents can be positioned on different parts of the benzene ring. Only one isomer of phenol or hydroxybenzene exists but cresol or methylphenol has three isomers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the ring. Xylenol has one hydroxyl group and two methyl groups and a total of 6 isomers exist.\nFunctional group isomerism.\nFunctional isomers are one of the structural isomers. Two compounds in functional isomerism have the same molecular formula (the number of each atom is the same, like cyclohexane: and 1-hexene:). But, the atoms are connected in other ways so that the groupings are different. We call these groups of atoms functional groups, functionalities, or moieties. Another way to say this is that two compounds that have the same molecular formula, but have different functional groups, are functional isomers.\nFor example, the chemical formula of cyclohexane and 1-hexene are C6H12. We call them functional group isomers because cyclohexane is a cycloalkane and hex-1-ene is an alkene.\nFor two molecules to be functional isomers, they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways. Some of the best examples come from organic chemistry. C2H6O is a molecular formula. Depending on how the atoms are arranged, it can represent two different compounds dimethyl ether CH3-O-CH3 or ethanol CH3CH2-O-H. Dimethyl ether and ethanol are functional isomers. The first is an ether. The carbon chain-oxygen-carbon chain functionality is called an ether. The second is an alcohol. The carbon chain-oxygen-hydrogen functionality is called an alcohol.\nIf the functionalities stay the same, but their locations change, the structural isomers are not functional isomers. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, but they are not functional isomers. Both of them are alcohols. The functional group (carbon chain-O-H) is present in both of these compounds, but they are not the same.\nWhile some chemists use the terms structural isomer and functional isomer interchangeably, not all structural isomers are functional isomers.\nFunctional isomers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy. Infrared radiation corresponds to the energies associated primarily with molecular vibration. The alcohol functionality has a very distinct vibration called OH-stretch that is due to hydrogen bonding. All alcohols in liquid and solid form absorb infrared radiation at certain wavelengths.\nCompounds with the same functional groups will all absorb certain wavelengths of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups. In fact, the infrared spectrum is divided into two regions. The first part is called the functional group region. Dimethyl ether and ethanol would have dissimilar infrared spectra in the functional group region.\nThe second part of the infrared spectrum is called the fingerprint region; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies. The fingerprint region is more specific to an individual compound. Even though 1-propanol and 2-propanol have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region, they differ in the fingerprint region.\nIn simple terms, functional isomers are structural isomers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether.\nIsomer counting.\nAs an example of isomer counting, 7 structural isomers exist with molecular formula C3H6O, each with different bond connectivities and air-stable at ambient temperature. An additional two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomers, but these are not stable."}

They changed the spelling. He used both versions of his name until 1884 when he finally adopted Karl. Eventually he became known as \"KP\".\nIn 1911 he founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London. He was a proponent of eugenics, and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and biographer of Sir Francis Galton.\nA conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.\nGalton.\nPearson met Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, at times close to hero worship.\nAfter Galton's death in 1911, Pearson started on a massive three-volume biography of Galton. The biography was done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to... the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\". It celebrated Galton's life, work, and talent. He predicted (wrongly) that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.\nWhen Galton died, he left much of his estate to University College London for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair, in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics, which included the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He stayed with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death in 1936.\nStatistics.\nPearson's ideas helped build the statistical methods in common use today."}

{"id": "337427", "revid": "199724", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337427", "title": "William Smith (geologist)", "text": "William 'Strata' Smith (23 March 1769 \u2013 28 August 1839) was an English geologist, who created the first nationwide geological map.\nLike another great scientist of his time, Michael Faraday, he was the son of a blacksmith. His geological discoveries were made when, as a young man, he was a surveyor, and so travelled the country. Smith's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type. So he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country.\nSmith put together the historical geology of Britain (England and Wales) and southern Scotland into a single record. At the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community. His humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society. His work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only later in his life that Smith got recognition for what he had done.\nThe map.\nIn 1799 Smith produced the first large scale geologic map of the area around Bath, Somerset. Before, he only knew how to draw the vertical extent of the rocks, but not how to display them horizontally. Then, in the Somerset County Agricultural Society, he found a map showing the types of soil and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. The different types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. He took a few rock types, each with its own colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.\nIn 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become \"The map that changed the world\".\nIn 1815 he published the first geological map of Britain. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours; the maps were hand coloured. The map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. He also published his \"Delineation of the strata of England\" in the same year. In another of his books \"Strata identified by organized fossils\" (London 1816\u20131819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossils. These fossil assemblages could be used to match rocks between regions. This marks Smith as an important figure in the history of stratigraphy.\nIn 1817 he drew a remarkable geological vertical section from Snowdon to London. Unfortunately, his maps were soon copied (plagiarised) and sold for prices lower than he was asking. He went into debt and finally became bankrupt.\nOn 31 August 1819 Smith was released from King's Bench Prison in London, a debtor's prison. He returned to his home at 15 Buckingham Street to find a bailiff at the door and his home and property seized. Smith again worked as an travelling surveyor for years. One of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised him and took steps to get him the respect he deserved. Between 1824 and 1826 he lived and worked in Scarborough. There he was responsible for the building of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast. The Rotunda was re-opened as 'Rotunda \u2013 The William Smith Museum of Geology', on 9 May 2008."}

She was the goddess of nature, fertility, mountains, and wild animals. She is often represented sitting on a throne, flanked by two lions, and wearing a mural crown. In Phrygian myth, she was born a hermaphroditic being named Agdistis, a child of Zeus and Gaia. Cybele had a shepherd consort named Attis, and a priesthood of eunuchs called the Galli. Her cult was adopted by the Greeks and later by the Romans.\nMythology.\nZeus let fall in his sleep seed upon the Earth, which in course of time gave birth to an androgynous being, born both male and female, whom they called Agdistis. But the gods, fearing Agdistis, cut off the male organ. The blood fertilized the soil and there grew up from it an almond-tree. A daughter of the river Sangarius picked an almond and laid it in her bosom, where the almond disappeared. She then had a child, a baby boy named Attis.\nCult.\nHer orgiastic cult dominated the central and north-western districts of Asia Minor, and was introduced into Greece via the island of Samothrake and the Boiotian town of Thebes. Cybele was closely associated with a number of Greek goddesses, firstly Rhea, the Greek mother of the gods (Meter Theon), but sometimes also Demeter (especially in the Samothrakian cult), Aphrodite (on Mount Ida) and Artemis (in Karia). Her main cult followers were the Galli, these were eunuch priests of a feminine nature, who celebrated her festivals with wild dancing, self-laceration, and self-scourging."}

She is the personification of a mountain of the same name in Phrygia.\nMythology.\nShe was born after Zeus accidentally impregnated the earth goddess Gaia. The gods feared Agdistis because she held all the powers of creation within her body. Dionysus tricked her into castrating herself, and from then on she was known as the goddess Cybele. The blood from her severed gentials fertilized the earth, and from that spot an almond tree grew. One day the nymph Nana picked an almond from the tree, and held it against her chest, the almond vanished and she became pregnant with Attis.\nCult.\nSome ancient writers say Agdistis is the same as Cybele, and worshiped under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly separate from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as an epithet of Cybele. Although primarily an Anatolian goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a lot of territory. By 250 BC it had spread to Egypt, and later to Attica, Rhamnus around 80 BC (where there was a sanctuary of Agdistis), and later in Lesbos and Panticapeum. "}

At festivals to Cybele and Attis they danced around wildly to loud music and whipped themselves until they bled. The newcomers to the priesthood would voluntarily castrate themselves. \nArchigallus.\nIn Rome, the head of the galli was known as the Archigallus. A number of archaeological finds depict the Archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The Archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by Rome's college of priests, and the term of service lasted for life. Along with the institution of the Archigallus came the Phrygianum sanctuary and the rite of the taurobolium, two aspects of the Cybele cult which the Archigallus had responsibility, as well as presiding over the Galli priests."}

A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.\nAccording to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.\nThis is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.\nIts role in taxonomy.\nThe biological species is the main reason for classifying living things, but applying it in practice is not easy. Good examples of this are the following:\nWhat this is saying is that, in practice, the biological species concept is not sufficient by itself to decide on the classification of animals.\nHistorical developments.\nJohn Ray.\nIn 1686 John Ray introduced a non-evolutionary biological concept. To him, species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.\nThe idea of a species as a physical type of organism had a long history. This survives as the concept of a type specimen in taxonomy. It was the way Linnaeus worked in his binomial classification, and is still useful for amateur naturalists today.\nCharles Darwin.\nIn the \"Origin\", Charles Darwin said that species were labels which experts gave on the basis of their observations.\nBut twenty years before, he had a much better idea. He thought of species as maintained by reproductive isolation. He even says \"Hence species may be good ones and differ scarcely at all in any external character\". Here he quotes the two sibling species of leaf warbler discovered in England by Gilbert White in 1768. At this early stage in his career, Darwin came very close to the modern biological species concept.p266\nModern era.\nIn the last 70 years two ideas have dominated the way professional biologists think about species.\nThe first is the population genetics concept. This is where a species is seen as a group which can mate together even though they are all to some extent different. It amounts to saying that a species is a gene pool.\nThe second is the use of DNA sequence analysis to show whether similar-looking species are genetically different from each other. This is especially useful when it is not practical to do breeding experiments.\nSibling species.\nSibling species are often called cryptic (hidden) species because their differences can only be seen by analysing their DNA. They are very common in the marine environment.\nMany cryptic species exist in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan \"Celleporella hyalina\", DNA sequence analysis was used to show that more than ten ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many millions of years.\nEvidence from the identification of cryptic species means that older estimates of global species richness are too low. For example, mitochondrial DNA research suggests there are at least 11 genetically distinct populations of giraffes. Similarly, the Amazonian frog \"Eleutherodactylus ockendeni\" is at least three different species which diverged over 5 million years ago."}

It does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and so is not an island. These are usually formed from submarine volcanoes. They are usually 1,000\u20134,000 metres (3,000\u201313,000 ft) in height from the sea floor. \nThe peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface, and so are in the deep sea. There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe, but only a few have been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi seamount in the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain.\nOver time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface. There wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface. After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called \"guyots\" or \"tablemounts\".\nSeamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.\nMost seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts. The Muirfield seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses. As they get older, water eats away at their sides. This causes landslides which, in turn, may cause massive tsunamis."}

In politics, it is the opposite of revolutions and rapid change. \"Gradualism is... sometimes associated with social democracy\".\nIn geology it is in tune with uniformitarianism, and against catastrophism. In biology it is in tune with Darwinian ideas of slowly changing species as opposed to big, rapid changes\nPolitics and society.\nGradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism. It is against abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings. Instead, change ought to be brought about in small, discrete steps.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating segregation. The government wanted to try to integrate African-Americans and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:\nThis is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.\u2014 Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC\nCharles Lindblom was an influential professor and author who believed in muddling through (\"incrementalism\") as the right way to go. He pointed out the connexions between the political system, the market-place and democratic freedom.\nGeology and biology.\nIn the natural sciences, gradualism is a theory that profound change is the product of slow but continuous processes. It is often contrasted with catastrophism. Gradualism was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton to explain geology, and was later was the basis for Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\". William Whewell called the idea 'uniformitarianism'. It formed the basis of early evolutionary theory.\nCharles Darwin was influenced by Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\". Everything we see from the past is explained by processes we can see going on today. The present is key to the past. So Darwin thought evolutionary must occur gradually, not in jumps ('saltations'), since we do not see big changes going on today. Extreme and rapid changes in an organism would be most likely to be fatal. It is almost universally agreed that complex organs such as the eye must have evolved by many small steps rather than by one or two mutations.\n\"Phyletic gradualism\" is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium. They proposed that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability or stasis, punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. Their idea is less accepted today."}

It is in the middle of a district called Lomellina, a great rice-growing centre. Vigevano received the honorary title of city with a declaration of Duke Francis II Sforza on February 2, 1532. Vigevano is well known for its beautiful Renaissance \"Piazza Ducale\", in the middle of the town.\nHistory.\nVigevano dates back to the 10th century AD, when it was one of Lombard king Arduin's favourite places because of the good hunting. \nVigevano was a Ghibelline township, favoring the Emperor and was therefore invaded and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it finally gave itself up to Azzone Visconti, after which it shared the fortunes of Milan. The Church of S. Pietro Martire (St. Peter Martyr) was built, with the neighbouring Dominican convent, by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1445. In the last years of Visconti's control it kept a siege by Francesco Sforza. Once he was settled in power in Lombardy, Sforza secured the erection of Vigevano as the seat of a bishop and provided its revenues.\nMain sights.\nCastello Sforzesco.\nVigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492\u201394 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), the great patron born in the town, who changed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is credited with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that travels between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d'Este."}

The state may also apply taxes or pay subsidies as a way to protect its own economy.\nOther factors that limit competition include the existence of cartels."}

{"id": "337929", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337929", "title": "Hotel Mario", "text": "Hotel Mario is a puzzle game developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the CD-i in 1994. The primary character of the game is Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into many levels, and what the player must do is close all doors on each level. Killing a Koopaling on the hotel's final level takes the player to the next building. After Nintendo decided not to have Philips create an add-on for the Super NES, they gave Philips permission to use five of their characters in games for Philips' CD-i. There wasn't a lot of time for the games to be developed and there was little funding. The games resulting from the license were widely criticized, with \"Hotel Mario\" being known as one of the worst \"Mario\"-centered games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the non-working controls and especially known for the cutscenes that used full motion video. The CD-i was considered a commercial failure and the games became valuable because of their rarity.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls Mario or his brother Luigi in two-player mode. The player has to complete all levels of the seven hotels in the game. The first six hotels contain 10 levels, and the last 2 hotels contains 15 levels. The player to shut every door before time runs out to get to the next level. The game does not show how to shut the doors. Elevators, which work differently depending on the hotel, let the player to go between the five floors of the level. The amount of points the player gets in the game will depend on how fast they can beat the level. Every stage has its own title screen, which is how the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter hotel levels that were already played and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.\nWhile trying to close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs off the edge of the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular \"Mario\" series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos, and their variations. The opponent on the last level of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who use different methods to try to kill Mario.\nIn his normal state, Mario can take one hit from an enemy and kill most of the monsters with a stomp. By opening doors, the player can find power-ups, which grant different powers. A Super Mushroom transforms Mario into Super Mario, making Mario glow and have the strength to take two enemy hits. If the player finds another mushroom while Mario is in the Super Mario form, the item turns into a Fire Flower. When grabbing it, Mario becomes Fire Mario and can throw fireballs to kill enemies. A 1-up mushroom known as \"Extra Mario Mushroom\" or \"Toad\" can only be found by Fire Mario. Another way to earn an extra life is collecting 30 coins. The player can also get a Star Man, which makes Mario temporarily able to knock any enemy off the screen by simply touching them.\nStory.\nBowser has turned the Mushroom Kingdom into a hotel resort for the use of himself and his children. The land is renamed \"Klub Koopa Resort\" because of this. Each hotel in the area is protected by one of the Koopalings and their henchmen. The hotels represent different building types with many different locations, including a tree, a mine and a cloud. When Mario and Luigi are invited to a picnic by Princess Toadstool, Mario and Luigi enter the Mushroom Kingdom. At the entrance, however, they find a message from Bowser. They find out that Bowser has taken control over the kingdom and established seven hotels there, at one of which Princess Toadstool is being held as a \"permanent guest\". As they visit the first six hotels, Mario and Luigi find the Princess many times, but on every occasion she disappears out of their sight, ending up in another hotel. They eventually enter another land where Bowser himself lives. With the hotel's owner killed, the brothers run away from the building with Princess Toadstool before it falls apart. The Princess, now able to rule her kingdom in peace, thanks the Mario brothers for saving her, giving them both a kiss.\nDevelopment.\nIn May 1991, after failing to develop a CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with Sony, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the add-on. However, after seeing the negative reviews of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable anymore, and the project was stopped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give comments on the look of the characters. The \"Mario\" characters were going to be used in \"Super Mario's Wacky Worlds\", but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While \"Wacky Worlds\" was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer video game \"Super Mario World\", \"Hotel Mario\" was made into a puzzle game in which level areas were limited to a single screen. Unlike the \"Legend of Zelda\"-related games also for the CD-i, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.\nMany full motion video cutscenes were animated for \"Hotel Mario\". The videos show Mario and Luigi as they get to the next hotel, telling each other and giving hints to the player such as: \"If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book!\". The voices of the Mario Brothers were provided by Marc Graue, with Jocelyn Benford doing the voice-over for Princess Toadstool. On top of the full motion video capabilities of the CD-i, \"Hotel Mario\" made use of the system\u2019s internal clock by showing messages that changed according to the date.\nThe backgrounds of the hotel stages were designed by freelance artist Trici Venola. After seeing \"Hotel Mario\"'s first version\u2014which Venola called \"mechanical\" and \"visually no fun\"\u2014she and art director Jeff Zoern decided to use elements from Disney and J. R. R. Tolkien to improve the game's visual style. Drawings of the stages were made out of several blocks, each of which featured one detail. The first item Venola created for all hotels was the door. Every building took one week to complete and was designed according to a specific theme. For example, a gothic design was used for Bowser's hotel.\nReception.\nUpon its release, \"Hotel Mario\" received negative reviews from video game magazines \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" and \"GamePro\". Critics commented that \"Hotel Mario\"s gameplay was simple yet addicting. \"GamePro\", while calling the game fun, believed that it would soon bore players, and gave it a fun factor of 2.5 out of 5. When \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named Mario the greatest video game character in 2005, they considered \"Hotel Mario\" his most embarrassing moment. Similarly, it was considered as the worst Mario game of all time by ScrewAttack, who criticized the game for its audio and controls, as well as for being solely \"based on shutting doors.\" GameDaily included \"Hotel Mario\" in its list of the worst games starring Nintendo mascots, stating its gameplay lacked identifiable Mario elements mainly used in the series. The game was also listed as the worst 2D platformer in the \"Mario\" series by N-Europe. The site found the Koopaling battles \"uniquely bad\", calling the game itself a \"steaming turd\".\nIGN said that \"Hotel Mario\" was better than \"The Legend of Zelda\" titles, but noted that closing doors was not \"a strong enough hook for an entire game.\" Chris Kohler of \"Wired\" magazine saw \"Hotel Mario\" as \"a puzzle game with no puzzles\", assuming it was one of the reasons why Nintendo was not impressed by the CD-ROM medium. The game was referred to as \"craptastic\" by GamesRadar and \"little more than a really rubbish version of \"Elevator Action\"\" by Eurogamer.\nIn its 1994 review, \"GamePro\" rated \"Hotel Mario\"'s graphics at 3.5 and sound at 4 out of 5, saying that \"the only intriguing aspects of this game are the well-fashioned animated sequences.\" Years after the game was released, the cut scenes were also criticized among video game websites, and were called \"outright terrifying\" by 1UP.com. IGN described them as \"abysmal\" and \"a bad flip-book of images printed out of Microsoft Paint. The quality of the voice acting was also questioned. Both 1UP.com and IGN thought the voices were unfitting for the characters and did not achieve the same playfulness as those of Mario and Luigi's current voice artist Charles Martinet. \"Hotel Mario\" was listed in the Top 20 Worst Mario Games of all time."}

It has a light grey body, broad wings, and a white face and neck. Its name comes from the two stripes (or \"bars\") of dark feathers that wrap around the back of its head. Like other geese, its feet are webbed. They can get up to 2.5 feet long and weigh 6.5 pounds. They eat mainly grass, wheat, barley and rice.\nPhysiology.\nThe main physiological challenge of bar-headed geese is getting oxygen from thin air to their aerobic muscle fibres so they can fly at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. \nStudies have found that bar-headed geese breathe more deeply and efficiently under low oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment. The haemoglobin of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to low-altitude geese.\nBar-headed geese have a slightly larger wing area for their weight than other geese, which is believed to help them fly at high altitudes. Birds at high-altitude still need to flap harder than lowland birds.\nAll this is relevant, since they fly through the high passes in the Himalayas when they migrate to &amp; from the Indian subcontinent."}

{"id": "338075", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338075", "title": "Croup", "text": "Croup (or laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat. This swelling causes problems with normal breathing. People with croup can have a \"barking\"cough, stridor (a high-pitched wheezing sound), and hoarseness. Croup symptoms often get worse at night. Taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition. Sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases. Hospitalization is rarely required.\nDoctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities (for example, an airway foreign body). Blood tests, X-rays, and cultures are not needed. Croup is common. About 15% of children between 6 months and 5\u20136 years old get croup. Teenagers and adults rarely get croup.\nSigns and symptoms.\nCroup symptoms include a \"barking\" cough, stridor ( a high pitched sound typically when breathing in), hoarseness, and difficult breathing that are worse at night. The \"barking\" cough can sound like a seal or sea lion. Crying can make the wheezing worse; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed. As croup gets worse, the wheezing can decrease.\nOther symptoms are fever, symptoms typical of the common cold), and the skin between the ribs pulling in when the child breathes. Drooling or a sick appearance can mean a different illness. The virus infection leads to swelling in the throat and air passages that can make breathing difficult.\nCauses.\nMost croup is caused by a virus infection. Some people call severe laryngotracheitis croup. This disease is caused by a milder virus. Croup also can be laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. These diseases are caused by bacteria and are more severe.\nVirus.\nIn 75% of cases, the parainfluenza virus, mainly types 1 and 2, causes croup. Other viruses that can cause croup include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Spasmodic croup (croup with barking) does not have the usual signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treating spasmodic croup is the same as treating regular croup.\nBacterial.\nBacterial croup includes laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\" causes laryngeal diphtheria; bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis come from a virus infection, followed by a bacteria infection. The most common bacteria that cause croup are\"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", \"Hemophilus influenzae\", and \"Moraxella catarrhalis\".\nDiagnosis.\nCroup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to make sure it is not another condition that can block the upper airway, especially epiglottitis (an inflammation of the tissue that covers the trachea or windpipe) , something in the airway, subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords), angioedema (swelling underneath the skin), retropharyngeal abscess (pus in the back of the throat), and bacterial tracheitis (bacterial infection in the trachea).\nAn X-ray of the neck is not routine, but if it is done, it can show a narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because the narrow shape looks like a church steeple. The steeple sign does not appear in half of cases.\nBlood tests and viral cultures (tests for the virus) can cause irritate the airway. Cultures of the virus, obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration (using a tube to suck mucus out of the nose), are used to confirm the exact cause. These cultures are restricted to people doing research. If a person does not improve with standard treatment, further tests can be done to check for bacteria.\nSeverity\nThe most common system for describing the severity of croup is the Westley score. This test is used for research, but does not help the person with croup. Points are given for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis (blue skin coloring), stridor (wheezing), air entry, and retractions (skin on the chest pulling in). The table to the right lists the points given for each factor; the final score ranges from 0 to 17.\n85% of children going to the emergency department have mild disease. Severe croup is rare\u2013less than 1% of cases.\nPrevention.\nImmunization (vaccines) for influenza and diphtheria can prevent croup.\nTreatment.\nIt is important to keep children with croup as calm as possible. Children often are given steroids, but epinephrine is used in severe cases. If the amount of blood oxygen is under 92%, the child needs oxygen. People with severe croup can be hospitalized for observation. If oxygen is needed, \"blow-by\" administration (holding an oxygen source near the face of the child) is better than an oxygen mask, because it is less likely to upset a child than an oxygen mask is. With treatment, less than 0.2% of people need endotracheal intubation(a tube placed into the airway).\nSteroids.\nCorticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, can be used to treat croup. People begin to improve a lot within six hours after taking steroids. Steroids work when given by mouth, injection, or inhalation (breathing them in), but taking them by mouth is best. Most of the time, a single dose is enough. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6\u00a0mg/kg appear to be all equally good.\nEpinephrine.\nModerate to severe croup can be helped with nebulized epinephrine(an inhaled solution that widens the airway). While epinephrine reduces croup severity within 10\u201330 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If symptoms improve for 2\u20134\u00a0hours after treatment and no other complications happen, the child typically can leave the hospital.\nOther.\nThere is not enough evidence that other treatments for croup are helpful. Clinical studies do not show that breathing hot steam or humidified air is helpful and currently it rarely is used. Medical professionals do not want people to use cough medicines, which containdextromethorphan and/or guiafenesin. Clinical studies also do not support inhaling heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to make it easier to breath. Since most cases of croup is are diseases, antibiotics are not used unless bacteria are also suspected. The antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended for bacterial infections. In severe cases associated with influenza\u00a0A or B, theanti neuraminidase inhibitors can be given.\nLikely outcome.\nMost of the time, croup caused by a virus is a short-term disease. Croup rarely causes death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms improve within two\u00a0days, but can last for up to seven\u00a0days. Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis (infection of the trachea), pneumonia (lung infection), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).\nEpidemiology.\nAbout 15% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5\u20136 years will get croup. Croup accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions for this age group. In rare cases, children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years have croup. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females; croup is more common in autumn (fall).\nHistory.\nThe word \"croup\" comes from the Early Modern English verb \"croup,\" meaning \"to cry hoarsely\"; the name was first used for the disease in Scotland. Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's Ancient Greece. In 1826, Bretonneau distinguished croup from a virus and croup due to diphtheria. The French called croup from a virus \"faux-croup,\" using \"croup\" for a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria. Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown since most people are immunized."}

It is the third movement in \"The Nutcracker pas de deux\". This \"pas de deux\" is from Act 2 of the 1892 ballet \"The Nutcracker\". It is danced by the principal female dancer. The number was choreographed by Lev Ivanov to music written by Tchaikovsky. \nChoreographer Marius Petipa wanted the Sugar Plum Fairy's music to sound like \"drops of water shooting from a fountain\". Tchaikovsky found the ideal instrument to do this job in Paris in 1891. It was then that he came across the recently invented \"celesta\". This instrument looked like a piano. It sounded like bells. Tchaikovsky wrote, \"[The celesta is] midway between a tiny piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wonderful sound.\" He wanted to use the celesta in \"The Nutcracker\". He asked his publisher to buy one. He wanted to keep the purchase a secret. He did not want other Russian composers to \"get wind of it and ... use it for unusual effects before me.\" \nTchaikovsky introduced the \"celesta\" to Russian music lovers on 19 March 1892 when the \"Nutcracker Suite\" was performed for the Russian Musical Society in St. Petersburg. The instrument is forever identified with the Sugar Plum Fairy. It is heard in other parts of Act 2 of \"The Nutcracker\" besides the Sugar Plum Fairy's dance. The \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" is one of the ballet's best known musical numbers. It is often \"jazzed up\" for television commercials at Christmas time. \nThere is little information about the Sugar Plum Fairy's original choreography. In the first performances the \"presto\" at the end of the dance was cut. According to Roland John Wiley, the dance appears to have consisted of short \"pointe\" steps, \"petite batteries\", and \"attitudes\" in various combinations. He describes the dance as having \"a sense of dynamic build up: from delicate angularity ... to circular shapes, to plainer but more virtuoso movements\"pirouettes\" to \"rounds de jambe\"near the end.\" \nThe first Sugar Plum Fairy was Antonietta Dell'Era. She was a good technician, but Tchaikovsky's brother Modest described her as pudgy and unattractive. Although the Sugar Plum Fairy is the \"prima ballerina\" of \"The Nutcracker\", she has very little dancing to do. This was a considered a major defect among early critics. Dell'Era tried to expand the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy in later performances by putting a gavotte by Czibulka into the score. "}

We define that \"x\"\u22121 = 1/\"x\". This means a number raised to a power of \u22121 is equal to the reciprocal of that number. The exponential law \"x\"\"a\"\"x\"\"b\" = \"x\"(\"a\" + \"b\") for a,b non-zero real numbers is true even if a or b is negative.\nComputer representation.\nThere are many ways that \u22121 (and negative numbers in general) can be represented in computer systems. The most common is as two's complement of their positive form. In standard binary representation, this can also represent a positive integer."}

MD5 stands for Message Digest, and was made to replace the MD4 standard. \nIt is mainly used for security in database systems. The algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data (strings, text etc.). Any change to the data, either deliberate or accidental, will mean the hash code will also change. By comparing the codes, it is easy to see if a change has been made. MD5 was invented by Ron Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. An MD5 hash code provides a 32-digit hexadecimal number. By 1996, methods were developed to break the security of an MD5 algorithm. This was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data. MD5 is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data, but it is still considered OK to protect from accidental changes, for example single-bit changes caused by noise on a network connection. An MD5 hash could look like: 9c677286866aad38f8e9b660f5411814. This is the hash of the string \"Wikipedia\"."}

It is one of the three main forms of plague (the other two being the bubonic and penumonic). It is caused by the bacterium \"Yersinia pestis\".\nSepticemic plague can cause the blood to form small clots through the body. Without treatment it is almost always fatal. The death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent. Septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck Europe in 1348, the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague. This disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect. In rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human. In septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood, causing severe sepsis. The endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas. This causes the cells in the area to die. DIC uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot, so that it can no longer control bleeding. This means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and coughing up or vomiting of blood (hemoptysis/haemoptysis). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites. These bumps are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die. In some cases, people may even die on the same day they get the disease.\nSymptoms.\nNote: Septicemic plague may cause death before any symptoms occur\nSepticemic plague in Medieval times.\nThe septicemic plague was the least common of the three plagues that occurred from 1348 to 1350. Like the others, the septicemic plague spread from the East through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea. Major port cities such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest. The three plagues that are part of the Black Death were a major factor in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.\nOther websites.\nGoogle Health - Plague&lt;br&gt;\nHowStuffWorks - \"Septicemic Plague\""}

His name in English is Titian. He was one of the leading painters of the 16th century Venetian school; he is also seen as one of the principal artists of High Renaissance painting of the 16th century. When he was alive, he was often called \"Da Cadore\", after his place of birth.\nWhen he was active, the Republic of Venice had a Golden Age, and was well-off economically. Aged nine, Titian went to Venice. The brothers Gentile and Giovanni Bellini taught him how to paint. In 1513, he opened his own shop, and developed into a successful painter, known all over Europe. In 1533, Charles V made him a nobleman. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V. In 1545, Pope Paul III invited him to come to Rome, in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, Philip II to the Diet of Augsburg. When Titian died of the Plague in the year 1576, he was an old man. He was also one of the most famous painters of Venetian history.\nTitian was very productive: in total, he painted 676 works. He did portraits, landscapes, as well as themes from mythology and religious works. All his works are very colorful. This special use of color influenced other painters of the same period a great deal. His works influenced painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Antoine Watteau and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix."}

{"id": "338395", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338395", "title": "The Dream of Gerontius", "text": "The Dream of Gerontius is a large musical work for choir, three solo singers and orchestra composed by Edward Elgar. It was composed and first performed in 1900. It is an oratorio, although Elgar did not like it being called an \u201coratorio\u201d, but this is how it is usually described. It is usually thought of as the best choral work Elgar ever wrote.\nThe words are from a poem by John Henry Newman. They are supposed to be the words of a man called Gerontius who is dying. He imagines what is going to happen to him when he dies: how he will meet God who will judge whether he has been good enough to go to heaven. The angel speaks to him in the poem. There is also a priest, and a short solo for the Angel of Agony. The work is in two parts. Part I is about 40 minutes long and Part II lasts about an hour.\nFirst performances.\nThe work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900 and the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. There were problems at the first performance: the chorus master died while the work was being learned. Some of the music sounded strange to the choir who found it very difficult. The soloists were not very good, and it was difficult for the conductor, Hans Richter (who was an excellent conductor) to stop the choir from singing out of tune. Richter had not had time to prepare the work properly: he was only given the full score on the day before the first rehearsal. The next year the work was performed in Germany where it was well received.\nAnother reason why it was slow to become popular in England was that the ideas in the poem were from the Roman Catholic teaching (John Henry Newman was a Roman Catholic Cardinal). This meant that a lot of Anglican cathedrals did not want it to be performed, so changes were made to the text. This new version was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910. It quickly became popular in England. It was performed in Chicago and New York in 1903, and then in many other cities.\nA few years earlier it had been suggested to the Birmingham Festival that Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k should be commissioned to compose a work on \u201cThe Dream of Gerontius\u201d. They decided that the work was \u201ctoo catholic\u201d.\nThe soloists.\nThere are three solo singers in the work. The most important is the tenor soloist who sings the words spoken by the dying Gerontius. There is also a bass who sings the Priest, and a mezzo-soprano who sings the part of the angel. The Angel of the Agony can be sung by the same bass who sings the Priest. The choir sometimes divides into two, and sometimes there is a small group of upper voices called the \u201csemi-chorus\u201d.\nThe story of the poem.\nNewman's poem tells the story of a soul's journey through death. It is thinking about the unseen world of Roman Catholic theology. The name Gerontius comes from the Greek word \"geron\", \"old man\". The name \"Gerontius\" is not sung in the work, and not everyone agrees on how it is pronounced. The Greek \"geron\" has a hard 'g' (like in \u201cgrass\u201d), but English words that come from it often have a soft 'g', as in \"geriatriac\". Elgar did not use all the words of Newman\u2019s poem. He leaves out a lot of the meditations in Part 2 which would otherwise have made it very long.\nIn the first part, we hear Gerontius who is very faithful to God. Sometimes he is frightened but at other times he is hopeful. A group of friends (also called \"assistants\" in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, say farewell as he sets off on his journey. In the second part, Gerontius, now called \"The Soul\", wakes up in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware that his guardian angel is there. She is happy that her task (bringing Gerontius to God) is done (the angel in Newman\u2019s poem is male, but Elgar makes the angel female, giving the part to a female singer). They have a long conversation after which they journey to the throne of judgement. They have to pass the demons. They meet a choir of angels who are praising god. The Angel of the Agony pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius briefly sees God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, gives him a final blessing and promises him he will wake up in glory.\nThe orchestra.\nElgar scored the work for a large orchestra which includes, besides the usual instruments, piccolo, cor anglais, contrabassoon, harp and organ.\nThe work as an oratorio.\nAlthough people usually describe it as an oratorio, it is not an oratorio in the traditional sense: there are no breaks in the music (except between the two parts), and it does not tell a story from the Bible.\nThe music.\nThe music is written in a late Romantic style which is clearly inspired by Wagner, especially by his opera Parsifal. The opening of \u201cThe Dream of Gerontius\u201d is a long orchestral introduction which uses themes that are going to be important in the work. The music of the character Gerontius is sometimes in speech rhythm (similar to recitative) but often very lyrical. Elgar moves quickly from one style to the other. The chorus provide a wonderful reflection on what is happening. The chorus of angels singing \u201cPraise to the Holiest in the Height\u201d is particularly beautiful. The chorus of demons is very difficult to sing."}

The population was about 375,000 as of 2006. It is the capital of Balkh province. It is linked by roads to Kunduz in the east, Kabul in the south-east, Herat to the west and Uzbekistan to the north. The city is a major tourist attraction in Afghanistan because of its famous shrines as well as the Muslim and Hellenistic archeological sites. In 2006, the discovery of new Hellenistic remains was announced.\nHistory.\nThe region around Mazar-e-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khorasan and was controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurids, and Khanate of Bukhara.\nThe name Mazar-e-Sharif means \"Noble Shrine\". This name represents the Blue Mosque which is widely known to be the grave of Hazrat Ali (prophet Mohammad's son-in-law).\nThe city and region became part of the Afghan Durrani Empire around 1750.\nMazar-e Sharif remained peaceful for the next one hundred years. In 1979 then neighboring Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. During the 1980s Soviet war, Mazari Sharif was a strategic base for the Soviet Army.\nTaliban conquest.\nBetween May and July 1997, the Taliban unsuccessfully attempted to take Mazar. About 3,000 Taliban soldiers were killed by Abdul Malik and his Shia followers. The Taliban returned on August 8, 1998 and led a six-day killing frenzy of Hazaras. Soon after, the city was occupied and taken over by the Taliban.\nUnited States military action.\nFollowing 9/11, Mazar Sharif was the first Afghan city to fall to the Northern Alliance (United Front). The Taliban's defeat in Mazar quickly turned into defeat from the rest of the north and west of Afghanistan. On November 9, 2001 the city was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces after the Battle of Mazar e Sharif with help from the United States Special Operations Forces and bombing by U.S. Air Force aircraft. As many as 2,000 Taliban fighters who surrendered were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle. Reports also place U.S. ground troops at the scene of the massacre.\nNATO and United Nations presence.\nThere are also NATO peacekeeping forces in and around the city providing assistance to the Afghan government.\nApril 2011 killings of UN workers and protesters.\nOn April 1, 2011, as many as ten foreign employees working for United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) were killed by angry demonstrators in the city. The demonstration was organized in retaliation to the March 21 Qur'an-burning in Florida, United States.\nClimate.\nThe climate in Mazari Sharif is very hot during the summer. Daily temperatures are over 40\u00b0C or 104 degree Fahrenheit in June and July. The winters are cold with temperatures falling below freezing.\nDemography.\nThe population of Mazari Sharif is around 375,000. It is a multiethnic and multilingual society.\nThe main language in Mazari Sharif is Dari (Persian) followed by Pashto. Both are the official languages of Afghanistan.\nLocal events.\nThe city is a centre for the traditional buzkashi sport, and the Blue Mosque is the focus of Afghanistan's Nawroz celebration.\nEconomy and transport.\nMazar-e Sharif serves as the major trading center in northern Afghanistan. It was the first city to connect itself by rail with a neighboring country. The rail service from Mazar-e Sharif to Uzbekistan began in 2011 and is expected to rapidly boost the economy of the city. Cargo on freight trains arrives to the last station near Mazar-i-Sharif Airport, where the goods are reloaded onto trucks or airplanes and sent to their last destinations across Afghanistan.\nThe local economy is mainly trade, agriculture and karakul production. Some oil and gas have also boosted the city's economy.\nNotable buildings.\nThe modern city of Mazar-i Sharif is centered around the Shrine of Hazrat Ali. Much restored, it is one of Afghanistan's most glorious monuments. Outside Mazar-i Sharif lies the ancient city of Balkh."}

The population of Azerbaijan is a native to the Caucasus area, which are of turk descent.\nMiddle Ages and the coming of Islam.\nIn the 7th century, Islam was introduced with the Arab conquest, which was important in the formation of a single nation and language in Azerbaijan, when the population became Muslim. A common religion for both Turkic and non-Turkic ethnic groups brought about the formation of common traditions, and the integration between the different ethnic groups living on the territory of Azerbaijan. By the middle of the 9th century, the Turkic ethnic group, the Azerbaijani people became the major ethnic group.\nThe establishment of a single state in Azerbaijan happened between the 15th century and the 18th century. This period is very important in the history of Azerbaijan. The ruler Shah Ismail Khatai (1501-1524) who was of Azerbaijani origin, united all the territories of Azerbaijan under his control. He founded the Safavid dynasty with Tabriz as its capital. During the rule of the Safavis, the Azerbaijani language also became the only official language. After the Safavid dynasty ended, Nadir Shah Afshar (1736-1747), an Azerbaijani commander founded the Afsharid dynasty (1736-1796) named after himself, and continued to rule over Azerbaijan's territories. He strengthened the borders and in 1739 invaded North India including Delhi. After Nadir Shah's death, his dynasty weakened and in the second part of the 18th century resulted in the formations of new smaller states.\nIn the late 18th century, then, the government of Iran passed to the Qajar dynasty (1796-1925), who were also of Azerbaijani origin. Their main policy was to unite all the territories once ruled by their ancestors. This gave the start to several long wars between the Qajars and Russia, with both parties aiming to occupy the South Caucasus which Azerbaijan is a part of. Azerbaijan was divided between the two empires. The northern part of Azerbaijan was annexed to Russia, while the south went to Iran. This is the origin of today's political division between \"North Azerbaijan\" which today has become the Republic of Azerbaijan, and \"South Azerbaijan\", which today is a part of Iran.\nRussian and Soviet rule.\nAzerbaijan came under Russian rule after the Persian-Russian wars of 1804-1813. The country gained independence for a short period, however, towards the end of the First World War. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia formed the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When this republic ended in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan on May 28, 1918, as the first modern and secular parliamentary republic in the Muslim World. However, the Red Army occupied the territory and annexed it to the newly formed Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was founded on April 28, 1920. \nDuring the Second World War and after, the Azerbaijan SSR, as a petroleum producer, was important in the energy policy of the Soviet Union. Following the politics of reforms called \"glasnost\", started by the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, riots and ethnic fighting grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to the Soviet government's lack of response to the already tense conflict between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which resulted in the massacre known as \"Black January\" in the capital Baku in January 1990. Azerbaijan eventually declared independence on October 18, 1991. The Soviet Union was ended on December 25, 1991.\nIndependence.\nWhen Azerbaijan became independent, the conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh turned into the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1991-1994.\nThe politician Heydar Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan in 1993 and successfully stabilized the country and a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia was signed in 1994, which paused the war. However, 20 % of Azerbaijan remained occupied by the Armenian military and the two countries were in a state of war, until November, 2020. Nevertheless, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks organized by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) \"Minsk Group\" to solve the conflict and restore the territory to Azerbaijan. When Heydar Aliyev died in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan and is continuing his father's policies today. As an important producer of petroleum and natural gas, Azerbaijan's economy is increasing very rapidly every year, and has become rich as a result."}

The first generation of Romantic poets (1798) were primarily Coleridge, William Blake and Wordsworth. The second generation was at its culmination in the 1820s, with poets such as Shelley, Byron and Keats. The movement showed an interest in the Gothic, Medieval art, and nature. The ballad form was re-introduced, and the poems often took their form from fairy tales and folk songs. Poets were enjoying writing for themselves rather than senior nobility, and later they were the source of inspiration for the Pre-Raphaelite painters."}

It has been used in the Soviet Japanese campaign in WWII immediately behind the first echelon of tanks and mechanized vehicles of advancing Soviet army should they encounter any particular contagious disease as withdrawing enemy forces had poisoned many wells and water sources.\nThe use of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance or similar practices in the armed forces is mentioned elsewhere. The Polish contingents serving under the UN auspices focused their tasks among others on \u2026 sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance \u2026 \nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible deployment and action of armed forces, the same data for the neighbouring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the reconnaissance is to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin- sources of the infection in extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the infestation. It should result in revealing of the patients and persons, suspected to the specific disease, their isolation and hospitalization. Mobile equipped group for sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance includes: epidemiologist, specialist on infections, assistant of epidemiologist (bacteriologist- lab assistant), medical orderly (if necessary, the group will include zoologist or parasitologist). After the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peace time the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.\nIn 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in Geneva \nthe sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as means for monitoring of infections and parasitic agents and for practical implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases, the treat of alleged use of biological weapons. The sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance will be important in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.\nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance (inspection) or a similar practice and specific indication in the hotbed should be performed immediately after the receiving of the information about bio-terrorism attack."}

It is on the eastern edges of Cambridge, south of Newmarket Road and west of the village of Teversham, from the centre of Cambridge and about from London. \nThe airport opened in 1938. It replaced the old airfield at Fen Ditton. The airport is owned and run by Marshall Aerospace. This is a Cambridge-based company with many years' history servicing civilian and military contracts. The main building was designed by the architect Harold Tomlinson of the University of Cambridge. It was constructed in 1936\u201337. For many years it was the base for the Cambridge University Air Squadron.\nMarshall of Cambridge Aerospace Limited has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P433). This is a special license that allows it to have public passenger flights and flights for flying training. It has four flying schools. It is also used for corporate and private flights.\nIn October 2008, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. This happened at the same time as the new Marshall Business Aviation Centre was opened. In 2011, Cambridge Airport officially broke off from Marshall. It hired a new director and changed its name back to Cambridge Airport. Its aim is to become a \"hub\" (important airport) for the east of England. The Passenger Terminal will be refurbished.\nFuture.\nLand in Cambridge is expensive. Around the city are large areas of green belt land. Building new houses on this land is not allowed. Because of this, a proposal was made in 2000 to move the airport to a new site away from the city. It would have freed up of land so that several thousand new homes could be built there instead. Cambridgeshire County Council did a study for a new airport. The council asked for permission to plan the new airport, but they withdrew the request later.\nSince then, Marshall Aerospace has continued to develop the site. In autumn 2008 new facilities for aviation companies were opened. These included a new hangar, which added to the of hangar space already on the site.\nIn April 2010, Marshall Aerospace said it would not be moving Cambridge Airport to make way for new housing. RAF Mildenhall, Waterbeach Barracks and RAF Wyton were though of as alternative sites, but Marshall decided that there were \"no suitable relocation options\" (none of the options were good enough). \nIn January 2011, Cambridge Airport broke off from Marshall, and released plans for the airport's future. Its plans are to have international flights for the London 2012 Olympic Games. For 2012 the airport has introduced new international holiday charter flights to Europe as well as new regular (on a timetable) air links to the Channel Islands. Passenger terminal facilities are being fully upgraded to improve services and convenience for passengers. The airport is planning to add flights to more places that are important for business and leisure."}

Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, at right angles to each other. Fabrics which are not woven, such as felt, do not have a bias.\nWhen cut on the bias, woven fabric is more elastic as well as more fluid in movement, compared to the on-grain direction. This helps many types of garment, such as skirts, dresses and neckties.\nThe \"bias-cut\" is a technique used by tailors and dress-makers for cutting cloth. The greater stretch in the bias (diagonal) direction of the fabric, helps it accentuate body lines and curves and drape softly. For example, a full-skirted dress cut on the bias will hang more gracefully or a narrow dress will cling to the figure. \nBias-cut garments were prominent in haute couture clothes designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s. It is still used often in both haute couture and high street clothing. In the Middle Ages, before the development of knitting, hose leggings were cut on the bias in order to make them fit better."}

She used the bias cut, made Grecian-style dresses and introduced haute couture design to high street shops.\nLife &amp; career.\nBorn into a poor family in Chilleurs-aux-Bois, Loiret, Vionnet began her apprenticeship as a seamstress at age 11. After a brief marriage at age 18, she left her husband and went to London to work making clothes in a hospital. While in London, Vionnet worked as a fitter for Kate Reily (or Reilly). Reily bought original French designer dresses and brought them to her London workshop. There she had them copied, and sold the copies to her London clients for half the price of the originals. Vionnet was head of her workshop (\"atelier\"), cutting, fitting and directing the seamstresses.p30\nVionnet eventually returned to Paris and trained with well known fashion houses. In 1912 she founded her own fashion house, \"Vionnet\". In the 1920s she created a stir by re-introducing the bias cut, an old technique for cutting cloth diagonal to the grain of the fabric. She developed techniques for managing the problems the bias cut caused. Bias cuts cling to the body and move with the wearer. Vionnet's use of the bias cut to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look would change women's clothing and carry her to the top of the fashion world.\nMadeleine's clothes were famous for accentuating the natural female form. Influenced by the modern dances of Isadora Duncan, Vionnet created designs that showed off a woman's natural shape. Like Duncan, Vionnet was inspired by ancient Greek art, in which garments appear to float freely around the body rather than distort its shape.\nVionnet's simple-looking styles were not simple to produce. She cutt, draped, and pinned fabric designs on to miniature dolls, before recreating them in chiffon, silk, or Moroccan crepe on life-size models. Vionnet used materials such as cr\u00eape de chine, gabardine, and satin to make her clothes; fabrics which were unusual in women's fashion of the 1920s and 30s. She would order fabrics two yards wider than necessary in order to accommodate draping, creating clothes \u2013 particularly dresses \u2013 that were luxurious and sensual but also simple and modern. Characteristic Vionnet styles included the handkerchief dress, cowl neck, and halter top.\nVionnet influenced the design of mass production \"pr\u00e9t \u00e0 porter\" (ready to wear) clothing. She had worked in mass production as a hospital seamstress, and could simplify her designs for the retail market. High fashion was too expensive for working people, and (unlike today) was not copied in the high street. Vionnet's ability to take her designs off the cat walk and into the high street revolutionised the fashion industry and popular culture.\nCopyright on fashion designs.\nIn 1930, Suzanna Laneil was caught with 48 copies of Chanel and Vionnet designs. Vionnet sued her, in a French landmark case. The Court found that the design originals by Vionnet were \"real works of art\" and that they were \"entitled to the same protection accorded authors and copyright holders\". That protection has been written into the statute and ratified by European treaties on copyright law. Vionnet began as a style copiest with Kate Reilly, but became a strong supporter of intellectual property protection for designers."}

Economists such as David Ricardo (1772-1823) had this idea. Ricardo founded a movement that is known as Ricardian socialism today. Many people in the labour movement had this idea too. Ferdinand Lassalle (1825\u20131864) and Eugen D\u00fchring (1833-1921) expressed such ideas towards Leon Trotsky. Despite this, Vladimir Lenin was the first person to say that this element is fundamental to Marxist theory.\nAccording to Libertarian socialist thinkers, such as American anarchist Benjamin Tucker, socialism is a system in which the laborer receives the full product of his labor. This eliminates exploitation and unearned income accrued to the capitalist.\nThe term \"To each according to his contribution\" simply means that each worker in a socialist society receives \"wages\" and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed. That way, highly productive workers will receive more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. What is more, the more difficult the job is, the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. Difficulty can result from factors such as greater training requirement, job intensity or safety hazards. According to Trotsky, the idea is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. In the end, the principle comes from capitalism, but will vanish, according to Marx, as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and as goods become available in greater quantities.\nIn capitalism, the means of production are owned by a few people; these people are also known as the bourgeoisie. These people do not produce, but they live off the work others do for them. Socialism can fix this issue, because with socialism, the means of production are owned by all people, they are a common good."}

{"id": "339642", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339642", "title": "Architecture of Singapore", "text": "The architecture of Singapore shows influences and styles from different places and periods. Singapore architecture may be divided into two periods: the more traditional pre-World War II colonial period, and the modern post-war and post-colonial period.\nPre-colonial architecture.\nMalay houses built in the 'kampong' style were common before the British came..\nColonial period.\nAfter the British established a settlement near the mouth of the Singapore River in 1819, building construction in Singapore changed. The new settlement was small but very urban. Merchants built warehouses right next to each other along Boat Quay. Risk of fire became a problem because the buildings were so close together and had many valuable goods inside. Builders switched to brick masonry with clay tiled roofs, to reduce the fire hazard. Bricks and tiles were made at kilns on the island, and the mortar and plaster was made by grinding up corals from sea around Singapore.\nShophouse.\n Shophouses are common style of building in Southeast Asia. They are usually two or three storeys high. Each shophouse is usually very narrow and part of a long row of terraced buildings. But, shophouses may be very deep front to back. The first floor is usually for business and the upper floors are for living.\nThe front of the building usually has a covered area called the \"five foot ways\". An 1822 law in Singapore said that all houses made of brick or tiles should be similar in the front. They should have an open arcade making an open passage on each side of the street. This style of building shophouses soon spread to other states in British Malaya. More rules said that the verandah ways should be .at least seven feet from the edge of the road and the walkway must be at least five feet wide.\nBlack and White bungalow.\nA bungalow is usually a small one or one-and-half storey home with deep verandahs. In Singapore, Many Europeans lived in bungalows from the 19th century until World War II. They are called Black and Whites for their white paint and dark wood.\nThese homes were similar to the UK's Arts and Crafts and Art Deco movements. They were built large enough to give rich families homes with light, air, and space. Black-and-Whites were built by wealthy families, successful businesses, the Public Works Department, and the British Armed Forces. Many are still homes today, but some have become shops, restaurants, or bars.\nArt Deco.\nSingapore has many Art Deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. The style was especially popular in commercial architecture, like factories and offices. Sometimes the style was only on the surface. Often, Art Deco style ornaments were added to typical shophouses or bungalows. The Art Deco period was important as a style, but also for bringing modern construction technologies like reinforced concrete to Singapore.\nModern architecture.\nSingaporean architecture moved to a modern direction after the war. The need to save money meant less spending on ornaments or features that only looked good. Simple forms and surfaces became more common. Modern architecture was also better for building many public buildings with the same or similar designs such as schools, clinics, factories, and especially public housing.\nPublic housing.\nPublic housing started in Singapore in the 1930s. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) carried out a building programme because there was not enough housing in the city. The SIT mainly built housing for middle and lower-middle class Asians at first. The Tiong Bahru estate is a typical example. It is a group of four-storey Art Deco style apartment blocks, shops, and markets outside the city center. After the war, the style changed from Art Deco to a simple, modern style.\n1970s to present.\nModern architecture was most important during the 1970s and 1980s. Brutalist architecture was common. Some older commercial buildings, such as the OCBC Centre by I. M. Pei, and many government office buildings are examples of this style."}

This means the position is given to children or family after the death of the diarch.\nModern examples of Diarchys are Andorra, the Republic of San Marino and the Kingdom of Eswatini.\nHistorical examples Diarchys are Sparta, The Roman Republic and at one point India\nNot all Diarchys have the diarchs as the head of state nor do they necessarily rule for their life. In Andorra for example, the Diarchs are the President of France, an elected, temporary position not passed down to children, as well as the Catholic\u00a0Bishop of Urgell who is appointed to the position by the Catholic Church. Ancient Sparta had Diarchs who were given the hereditary job for life, but only had roles in the military and religion, not politics.

She was an inspiration for modern dance.\nDuncan was born in San Francisco, California. She preferred natural movement, instead of what she called the artificial movements of ballet. Her 'free dance movement' was based on simple, flowing movements of the body. It was inspired by nature, and by ancient Greek sculptures. Costumes were flowing and transparent. Dances involved simple runs, skips and jumps, big gestures and mime.\nDuncan was wildly unconventional. A bisexual who had two children but did not marry either of their fathers, she became a communist, and boasted about it. She went to the Soviet Union in 1922, but left in less than two years. At different times she lived in Paris, London and other European cities. She started dance schools in Moscow, Berlin and Paris. The schools did not last long, but Duncan had admirers who have continued her influence to the present day.\nPrivate life.\nDuncan's private life was tragic. Both her children were killed in a strange accident on the River Seine in 1913. The children were in a car with their nanny when the car stalled as the driver tried to avoid a collision. He got out to hand-crank the engine, but forgot to put the brake on. The car rolled across the road, down the bank and into the river. The children and their nanny drowned. Duncan married poet Sergei Yesenin (1895\u20131925) in 1922. He left her in 1923, and hanged himself two years later.\nDeath.\nDuncan liked long, flowing scarves. One of these scarves caused her own death. As \"The New York Times\" noted in its obituary: \"Isadora Duncan, the American dancer, tonight met a tragic death at Nice on the Riviera. According to dispatches from Nice, Miss Duncan was hurled in an extraordinary manner from an open automobile in which she was riding and instantly killed\". At her death, Duncan was a Soviet citizen.\nBorn in the United States, she lived in Europe from the age of 22 until her death at age 50. In the United States she was popular only in New York, and then only later in her life.\nLegacy.\nHer work was continued by some of her six adopted daughters. They were her pupils, the Isadorables, who continued to teach her methods after her death. There have been several revivals of interest in Duncan. There was a film, \"Isadora\" (1969) by Karl Reisz. There were two ballets. \"Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora\" by Frederick Ashton had its first show in 1976. Kenneth Macmillan created a two-act ballet \"Isadora\" for the Royal Ballet (1981).\nIn New York her tradition has passed to third generation Duncan dancer Lori Belilove. She founded The Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation in 1979 and The Isadora Duncan Dance Company in 1989.\nHer ideas on natural dance influenced a wide range of other dancers. Some of the ideas of the Denishawn School of Dancing are quite Duncanesque, and the growth of modern dance in general owes something to her."}

Standish became a assistant governor, and a treasurer of Plymouth Colony.\nEarly life.\nStandish's place of birth is uncertain. In his will he mentions Lancashire. Nathaniel Morton, secretary of Plymouth Colony, wrote that Standish was born in Lancashire.\nStandish was a soldier and fought against the Spanish in the Eighty Years' War.\nStandish and his wife did not believe in the Church of England and in 1608 they moved to Leiden Netherlands. After some years, they became concerned because their children were losing their English customs and culture. Since their religion was outlawed in England, they decided to travel to the New World.\nThere were many people in Leiden who did not believe in the Church of England and they also wanted to travel to the New World. They looked to employ someone who would protect them in the New World. They first asked John Smith. Smith was one of the founders of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia. He had explored and made a map of the North American coast. Smith's experience would have helped them but he asked for too much money. He was also too bold and they feared he might try to rule over them. They asked Standish instead and he agreed to help protect them. They decided to hire the ship \"Mayflower\" to take them on their long voyage.\nOn the \"Mayflower\".\nThe \"Mayflower\" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30\u201340 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" saw land. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.\nExploration Missions.\nWhile the Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod, Standish took some men ashore to find a good place for all to live.\nWilliam Bradford wrote of one of the exploration missions. They were Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty set off in small boats. Hopkins was the most experienced because he had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. Bradford said they set off in below freezing temperatures. Many of the men were ill, and when they left the salt spray froze on their coats. During their trip they saw Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men approaching the Indians fled. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians.\nAfter more trips in late December 1620 they picked a place to live. Standish gave good advice and they built a small fort and placed cannon for protection against any who might try to harm them. Standish's wife, Rose, died in January.\nMany passengers were sick but Standish stayed healthy. Standish was a source of great comfort and strength to those who suffered. Standish helped to care Bradford when he was sick and they became good friends. Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and worked closely with Standish.\nPlymouth Colony.\nIn March of 1621, a Native American named Samoset came to the colony and spoke to the people in English. He stayed one day and talked with the leaders about many things. When he returned he brought the tribe leader Massasoit to meet with the Pilgrims. Governor John Carver, signed a treaty with this chief and they became friends. They all promised to help and defend each other. \nIn August 1621 a leader named Corbitant tried to turn the people of Nemasket against Massasoit. Standish led a group of ten men to kill Corbitant. Three Native Americans, Squanto, Hobomock and Tisquantum went with them. When Tisquantum and Hobbamock went to Nemasket, Corbitant took Tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him. Hobbamock got away and warned the people of Plymouth.\nStandish planned an attack. Standish and Hobbamock went to where they thought Corbitant would be sleeping but he had already fled the village. They did not kill Corbitant but because the colonist were willing to fight, if necessary, nine other leaders, and Corbitant, signed a treaty with the leaders of Plymouth.\nIn November 1621, a Narragansett messenger came to Plymouth with a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin. The Pilgrims were told by Tisquantum and Hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from the Narragansett leader who was called Canonicus. This was one of the more powerful tribes in the area. Bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder to show them they were not afraid. Standish told the colonists to prepare for a possible fight. The ship \"Fortune\" had brought some more men to the colony but there were still not very many men. Standish put one man to each wall and gave them orders on how to protect themselves and the people in case of an attack.\nBradford called a public meeting. The Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight, including Hobbamock, to Wessagusset to kill the leaders who wanted kill them. The day after Pecksuot, a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group who threatened Wessagusset, came to the settlement with other warriors. Pecksuot approached Standish and, looking down on him, said, \"You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man. Though I not a chief, I am of great strength and courage.\" He said this to make Standish afraid of him. The next day, Standish attacked Pecksuot, and stabbed him with the Native American's own knife. Standish returned to Plymouth. The leaders who wished them harm had been killed and there was no more threat. The attack also caused many of the unfriendly Native Americans to leave the area.\nStandish showed great courage and skill as a soldier but sometimes was too harsh with the Native Americans. This would make both the Native Americans and the members of the colony angry.\nBy the 1640s, Standish was leading a quiet life on his farm in Duxbury. Standish also served as a surveyor of highways, as Treasurer of the Colony from 1644 to 1649. In 1642, his old friend Hobbamock, who had been part of his household, died and was buried on Standish's farm in Duxbury.\nStandish put Lieutenant William Holmes in charge of training the men. He died in his home in 1656. He was buried in Duxbury's Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Burial Ground.\nMarriages and family.\nStandish's first wife, Rose, died in 1621. She was buried in an unmarked grave at Cole's Hill as were many others who died the first winter and named on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb as \"Rose, first wife of Myles Standish\".\nStandish then married Barbara who died in 1659 They had seven children and her burial place is unknown. Their children were named, Charles, John, Myles, Loara, and Josiah and (again) Charles. The first child named Charles died.\nMonuments.\nThere are two monuments to Myles Standish. One is placed over his grave at the Myles Standish Burial Ground.\nThe site of Myles Standish's house is now in a small park in the town of Duxbury, Massachusetts.\nStandish, Maine, is named after Myles Standish. There are two forts named after Standish: a fort on Plymouth's Saquish Neck built during the American Civil War and a larger fort built in Boston Harbor in 1895."}

During this time, new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought; they also forced people to think differently, and started what is called science today. Better printing presses after Johannes Gutenberg's time caused a great rise in publishing. This period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century. \nGalileo Galilei invented kinematics and disproved Aristotle's old theory of gravity. One of his students said he dropped two balls of iron (one weighing one pound, the other a hundred) off the leaning tower of Pisa. The objects fell at the same speed which brought about new methods of thinking in that time period. In 1542, Nicolaus Copernicus published his work \"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\", in which he said that not the earth, but the sun was at the center of the universe. This theory is known as Heliocentrism today. In the same year, Andreas Vesalius pubilshed his work \"On the Structure of the Human Body\". This book is about the anatomy of the human body. \nThe philosopher Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (18921964) first used the term 'scientific revolution' for this time period."}

Sylvester Stallone and Christian Slater star. The earlier plays a hitman.\nPlot.\nIn New Orleans, hitman Jimmy Bobo and his partner Louis Blanchard kill a corrupt former Washington, D.C. policeman, Hank Greely. Bobo leaves a prostitute, Lola, alive. Later, at a bar, Blanchard is murdered by a man named Keegan. The man also threatens to kill Bobo.\nBobo and Detective Taylor Kwon meet each other in a bar. Kwon informs Bobo he knows Bobo and Blanchard killed Greely. Bobo leaves, and Kwon tries to follow him. Kwon is attacked by corrupt cops who were ordered by a man named Robert Morel to prevent Kwon from further investigating about Greely. Bobo rescues Kwon and takes him to a tattoo parlor. There, Bobo's estranged daughter, Lisa, treats Kwon's wounds. They later go to a massage parlor, where Bobo interrogates a middleman named Ronnie Earl, the man who hired Bobo and Blanchard on Morel's behalf. Ronnie Earl tries to kill Bobo. Bobo then kills Ronnie Earl, though his gun jams.\nBobo and Kwon agree to work together. They kidnap Morel's lawyer Marcus Baptiste and take him to Bobo's house. Baptiste is forced to give them a USB flash drive, which details Morel's plans to acquire housing projects and demolish them. Baptiste reveals Keegan is an ex-mercenary hired to be Morel's enforcer. After that, Bobo shoots him in the head.\nReception.\nRotten Tomatoes gave \"Bullet to the Head\" a 47% rating. Metacritic gave the movie a 48 score, meaning \"mixed or average reviews\". Jay Weissberg of \"Variety\" magazine called it a \"kickass actioner driven by personality rather than plot.\"\nBox office.\n\"Bullet to the Head\" was Stallone's worst opening weekend box office in 32 years.

They have a record from the latest stages of the Ediacaran to the early Cambrian period. Almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites. Most SSFs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate. This method of preservation is mainly limited to the later Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods, so the animals that made them may have arisen earlier and continued after this time.\nSome of the fossils represent the entire skeletons of small organisms, including the mysterious \"Cloudina\" and some snail-like molluscs. However, the bulk of the fossils are fragments or parts of larger organisms, including sponges, molluscs, slug-like halkieriids, brachiopods, echinoderms, and onychophoran-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of arthropods.\nOne of the early explanations for the appearance of the SSFs \u2013 and the evolution of mineralized skeletons \u2013 is a sudden increase in the ocean's concentration of calcium. However, many SSFs are made of other minerals, such as silica. The first SSFs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation, so it is likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well-defended prey. Nevertheless, it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible.\nThe small size and (usually) broken nature of SSFs makes them difficult to identify and classify. However, they provide evidence for how the main groups of marine invertebrates evolved, and for the pace and pattern of evolution in the Cambrian explosion. They include the earliest known representatives of some modern phyla, and they have the great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of early Cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts."}

The phrase dates back to at least World War II, when homosexual acts were illegal in the United States. Stating that, or asking if, someone was a \"friend of Dorothy\" was a euphemism used for discussing sexual orientation without others knowing its meaning.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of the phrase is most commonly attributed to the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\" because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example the \"gentle lion\" living a lie, \"I'm afraid there's no denyin', I'm just a dandy lion.\" Others claim that the phrase refers to celebrated humorist and critic Dorothy Parker, who included some gay men in her famous social circle.\nMisunderstanding.\nIn the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as \"friends of Dorothy.\" Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that a woman named Dorothy was at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel. The NIS launched an enormous hunt for Dorothy, hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay servicemembers."}

It was directed by Charles Walters and stars Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Eddie Bracken, Gloria DeHaven, Marjorie Main, and Phil Silvers. Nicholas Castle Sr. was the choreographer.\nJudy Garland struggled with many personal problems during filming, and \"Summer Stock\" was her last MGM movie. It was also her last pairing with Gene Kelly onscreen. MGM terminated Garland's contract - by mutual agreement - in September 1950.\nPlot.\nJane Falbury (Garland) is a farm owner. Her actress sister Abigail (DeHaven) arrives at the farm with her theater troupe. They need a practice stage, and Jane and her housekeeper Esme (Main) reluctantly agree to let them use their barn. The actors and actresses, including the director Joe Ross (Kelly), repay her hospitality by doing chores around the farm. Although Joe is engaged to Abigail, he begins to fall in love with Jane after Abigail leaves him in an angry fit. Jane is engaged to Orville (Bracken), but falls in love with Joe. The movie ends with a spectacular show in the barn itself, with the new leading lady, Jane.\nSoundtrack.\nAll songs were written by Harry Warren (music) and Mack Gordon (lyrics) except where noted. Orchestration chores were divided between Conrad Salinger and Skip Martin.\nBehind the scenes.\nShooting this movie was sometimes a struggle for Garland. She was coping with many pressures in her personal life, including a heavy reliance on prescription medication.\nAudiences noticed that in the last number \"Get Happy\" she appears thinner than in the rest of the movie. Before shooting the number, she had taken two months off and lost between 15-20 pounds. Garland finished the movie, and embarked on a long promised vacation from the studio. Soon, however, she was called back to star with Fred Astaire in the upcoming movie \"Royal Wedding\". Once again, Garland struggled to perform at her absolute best in the face of exhaustion and overwork. She was fired from the movie, and her contract with MGM was terminated through mutual agreement. Even though \"Summer Stock\" took six months to film, it was a box-office success.\nHighlights.\nThe film's most famous scene is the final song-and-dance number \"Get Happy\" performed by Judy Garland in a tuxedo jacket, black fedora, and black nylons to an arrangement by Skip Martin. This sequence was choreographed by Charles Walters and filmed two months after the rest of the movie, after Garland sought the help of a hypnotist in Santa Barbara and lost 20 pounds. With the sedative-hypnotic paraldahyde reportedly on her breath, which the number's male dancers described as sickeningly sweet, Garland performed the number perfectly in just a couple of takes, and the rest is history. According to \"New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther: \" 'Get Happy' finds Miss Garland looking and performing her best.\"\nIn another notable sequence, Kelly performs a solo dance in a darkened barn, using a newspaper and a creaky board as partners and props; the musical accompaniment reprises \"You Wonderful You\". The dance \"turned out to be one of the breakthrough numbers\" of his career."}

It was added to the World Heritage List at meeting of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairns in November 2000.\nDescription.\nThis area is one of rugged tablelands, cliffs, deep valleys and rivers and lakes. There are many rare and different plants and animals which tell the story of Australia's great age. It shows the story of the evolution of Australia's unique eucalypt trees and the other plants and animals which live among them.\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area covers about 10,300 square kilometres. It is mainly forest on a sandstone plateau 60 to 180 kilometres inland from central Sydney. The area includes large areas of wilderness and is about one third the size of Belgium, or twice the size of Brunei.\nThe Blue Mountains are a blue color. This is because rising air temperature makes the oil of Eucalypts evaporate into the air. This makes the mountains seem bluish.\nThe World Heritage Site includes eight protected areas. These are in two main blocks separated by land set aside for transport and housing. These areas are the:\nThe Blue Mountains are not really mountains, but a sandstone plateau rising from less than 100 metres above sea level to 1300 metres at the highest point. The plateau is cut through with deep valleys. There are basalt outcrops on the higher ridges. There are many different plants and animals which probably survived because they found shelter from climatic changes during recent geological history. \nVegetation.\nThe area is famous for its many different eucalypt habitats, from wet and dry sclerophyll grasslands, mallee heathlands, as well as swamps and wetlands. There are 91 species of eucalypts, 13% of all eucalypts, in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. Of these, 12 only grow here.\nThe area has been described as a natural laboratory for studying the evolution of the eucalypts. This is because there are so many of the different types growing in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. The area shows examples of how the eucalypts have changed to grow in the different Australian environments. These vary from tall forests at the margins or rainforest in the deep valleys, through open forests and woodlands, to shrublands of stunted mallees on the exposed tablelands.\nAs well as the eucalypts, the Greater Blue Mountains Area also contains ancient, relict species of world wide importance. The most famous of these is the recently discovered Wollemi pine. This tree is a \"living fossil\" dating back to the age of the dinosaurs. Thought to have been extinct for millions of years, the few surviving trees of this ancient species are known only from three small groups located in remote valleys within the area. The Wollemi pine is one of the world's rarest species.\nFauna.\nMore than 400 different kinds of animals live within the valleys and tablelands of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. These include threatened or rare species such as the tiger quoll, the koala, the yellow-bellied glider and the long-nosed potoroo. There are also rare reptiles and amphibians including the green and golden bell frog and the Blue Mountain water skink.\nThe largest predator of the area is the dingo. These wild dogs hunt for grey kangaroos and other prey.\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It has many of the world's rockwarblers, as well as flame robins, diamond firetails and pilotbirds. The endangered regent honeyeater is seen there regularly. It is also a migration bottleneck for yellow-faced honeyeaters.\nUNESCO listing.\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area was listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO on 29 November 2000.

It is a humanitarian act. It involves giving money, goods or time and effort to those who need it. It is done without expecting something in return. Giving money or food to poor people is an example of charity. Poor, sick or injured people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given. When such people are not supported, they often begin begging, which is directly asking for help from people they do not know. Others may rely on support from charitable organisations. These organisations collect money and goods and then give them to those in need.\nMost charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.\nCharitable giving can be a responsibility in many religions. This kind of charity is called almsgiving or alms. In Islam, for example, it is called \"zakat\". It is one of the five most important duties of being a Muslim."}

Feeling guilty for covering up Dent's crimes, Police Commissioner James Gordon writes a resignation speech telling the truth, but decides not to tell because it was not the right time. Batman has disappeared, with Bruce Wayne becoming an outcast. Cat burglar Selina Kyle steals Bruce's fingerprints from his home, kidnaps a congressman, then disappears. Selina hands Bruce's fingerprints to Phillip Stryver, an assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett, in hope of having her criminal record erased. Stryver double crosses Selina, but she uses the congressman's stolen phone to alert the police of their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, then chase the criminals into the sewers while Selina escapes. A masked man called Bane who had escaped from a hijacked CIA Plane captures Gordon. Gordon escapes, and is found by John Blake, a patrol officer who grew up as an orphan and has known Batman's true identity from their similar backgrounds. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him.\nWayne Enterprises is on the point of becoming bankrupt after Bruce wasted almost all of the companies money on a fusion reactor project when he learns that the core could be weaponized. Later, Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises. Alfred Pennyworth, concerned that Bruce has not moved on from being Batman, reveals to him that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and resigns in an attempt to dissuade him. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce and Lucius Fox asks board member Miranda Tate to take over his company. Bane later kills Daggett. After being promised to erase her records, Selina agrees to take Batman to Bane, but instead betrays him to a trap. Bane appears and reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows. He breaks Batman's back and takes him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping, the only prisoner to have ever done so; Bruce thinks the child is Bane.\nMeanwhile, Bane had kidnapped Fox, Tate, and Fredricks in order to turn on the bomb. While in the stadium, Bane triggers bombs under Gotham that causes the tunnels to collapse and traps most of the Gotham's police underground. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces an abducted physicist, Dr. Leonid Pavel, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb before killing him. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Prison, causing a revolution. The wealthy and powerful have their property destroyed or taken, are dragged from their homes, and given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane, where any sentence likely means death.\nAfter months of recovery and re-training, Bruce escapes from the prison; thanks to the prison doctor, and enlists Selina, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's forces fight at Gotham City Hall, Batman defeats Bane, but Tate later stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia, Ra's al Ghul's child, who escaped the prison thanks by her fellow prisoner, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by activating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, which makes the remote of detonation useless. Talia, then leaves to find the bomb. Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, an aircraft created by Fox, to bring the bomb back to the reactor, where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses The Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates.\nIn the months after, Batman is thought to be dead but is honored a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed The Bat's autopilot, and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refixed. While visiting in Florence, Italy, Alfred saw Bruce and Selina together. Blake resigns from the police force and finds the Batcave.\nBackground.\nThe movie is based on DC Comics character Batman. It is distributed under Warner Bros..

These include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christians, the Temple Mount for Jews, and the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims. The Old City formed the whole city of Jerusalem until 1860, when a Jewish neighborhood was built outside the Western Wall.\nThe Old City is historically divided into four quarters, although the current quarters were introduced only in the 19th century. Today, the Old City is divided into the Muslim Quarter, the Christian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter and the Armenian Quarter. After the war in 1948, the Old City was occupied by Jordan and the Jewish people living in the city were forced to move out. During the Six Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem. Today, Israel still controls the whole area, which it says is part of its national capital.\nIn 1980, Jordan asked UNESCO to make the Old City a World Heritage Site. It was added to the World Heritage list in 1981. Because of the conflict over the territory, it was added to the list of sites in danger in 1982. UNESCO policy is that East Jerusalem, including the Old City, is part of the occupied Palestinian territory.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

After distillation, it still contains chemical compounds with sulfur, oxygen and Nitrogen as well as other unwanted compounds, such as Alkalenes. Processed petroleum is used for lubricants; the substances mentione are unwanted in lubricants as they can speed up the aging process. For this reason, they are extracted using a process called hydrogenation. In hydrogenation, Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gases are produced. These gases require special handling, as they are very toxic.\nVegetable oil.\nVegetable oils and fats are produced by chemical or mechanical extraction from plants. This produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances, such as pigments and smell, which influence the quality of the refined product. In essence, the factors influenced are taste, shelf life, smell and color, as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations. Depending on the process, between four and eight percent of usable vegetable oil is lost. There are two basic procedures to refine vegetable oil, chemical refining, and physical refining.\nSugar.\nSugar is washed, and treated with concentrated syrup. Its colored because most customers expect sugar to be white. The white sugar sold in shops in almost pure sucrose. It has an extent of 99,8 percent of its weight.\nMetals.\nThere are two basic processes to refine metals: Refining by fire, and refining by electrolysis. Higher grades of purity require both processes, lower grades use only the first process. \nTable salt.\nSalt that is gained through evaportation of seawater needs to be cleaned; this is done by dissloving it in brine and then forcing it to crystallize. After the process, it is no lnoger possible to distinguish it from the salt extracted from rocks, by a mining process. Depending on the country, table salt for common use as a food additive may have iodine added. Sometimes Potassium fluoride is added as well."}

However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of Iran since then, except short duration after Mongol raid and establishment of Ilkhanate. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\nBefore the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian, however, there were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities. Eastern Iran (what is now Afghanistan) was predominantly Buddhist. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward Islam. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the \"dihqans\", or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.\nThough Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The Safavid dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran had become Shi'as, an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.\nNowadays Islam is the religion of 98% of Iranians, approximately 90% of Iranians are Shi'a and 8% are Sunni, mostly Turkomen, a minority of Arabs (mainly in Hormozgan Province), Baluchs, and Kurds living in the south, southeast, northeast and northwest. Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are Twelvers."}

This means that they will decay into other elements. Except for Plutonium, their half life is in the order of several minutes, to seconds. There is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives, there will be others with longer half lives. These are generally known as Islands of stability. These elements are expected to have isotopes with half lives in the range of several minutes. The hypothesis is that the atomic nucleus is built up in \"shells\" in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells.\nA filled shell would have \"magic numbers\" of neutrons and protons. One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126 \u2013 which would mean that the most stable spherical isotopes would be flerovium-298, unbinilium-304 and unbihexium-310. Of particular note is Ubh-310, which would be \"doubly magic\" (both its proton number of 126 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and thus the most likely to have a very long half-life. (The next lighter doubly magic spherical nucleus is lead-208, the heaviest stable nucleus and most stable heavy metal.)\nRecent research indicates that large nuclei are deformed, causing magic numbers to shift. Hassium-270 is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus, with deformed magic numbers 108 and 162. However, it has a half-life of only 3.6 seconds.\nIsotopes have been produced with enough protons to plant them upon an island of stability but with too few neutrons to even place them upon the island's outer \"shores\". It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well)."}

In the 17th and 18th centuries France gained and lost large territories in North America and India. Like the other empires of the time, was powered by slaves captured from Africa. The Haitian Revolution, when many of these slaves in the colony of Saint Domingue fought and defeated the French, caused major changes in the empire.\nSometimes, people say there was a first and a second French colonial empire. The \"First French Colonial Empire\" was from the French colonization of the Americas to the Napoleonic Wars. The \"Second French Colonial Empire\" is the French colonies in Africa.\nFrom the 16th to the 17th centuries, the First French colonial empire had a total area of over 10,000,000 square kilometres (3,900,000 sq mi), at its peak in 1680. At the time, it was the second-largest empire in the world, behind the Spanish Empire. In terms of land area, the Second French colonial empire extended to over 13,500,000 square kilometres (5,200,000 sq mi) at its peak in 1936. It was also the second largest in the world at the time, at 10% of the world's land area. The total land area of the first and second French colonial empire combined reached 24,000,000 square kilometres (9,300,000 sq mi).\nFrance began to establish colonies in North America, the Caribbean and India in the 17th century, but lost most of them after losing in the Seven Years' War. The North American colonies were lost to Britain and Spain. Spain returned Louisiana (New France) to France in 1800. Then, France sold it to the United States in 1803. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, mostly in Africa, but also in Indochina and in the South Pacific. It started to trade with the countries by supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire improved French reputation as an international power by spreading the French language and the Catholic religion. It also provided more men to fight in the World Wars.\nA major goal was the \"The Civilizing Mission\" (French: \"Mission civilisatrice\"). 'Civilizing' the populations of Africa by spreading language and religion was used to explain how the French colonial project worked. France sent small numbers of settlers to its empire, with the notable exception of Algeria, where the French settlers took power while being a minority."}

It was named a World Heritage Site in 2007.\nMine history.\nKamiya Jutei, a Japanese merchant, started the mine in 1526. By the early 1600s the mine was producing approximately 38 tons of silver a year. That was one third of the world's production at that time. \nWarlords fought over the mine until the Tokugawa Shogunate took control of it in 1600 after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Yamabuki Castle was built in the center of the complex. The mine produced less in the nineteenth century as it had trouble competing with other mines. It closed in 1923.\nPosition in the economy.\nIwami Ginzan Silver Mine was very important in East Asian trade because silver was the main currency. The silver mined at Iwami Ginzan was very high quality. From 17th century, coins made of the silver from the mine were not only one of the basic currencies in Japan but also used in the trade with China, Portugal and the Netherlands.\nWorld Heritage Site.\nThe Japanese Government named the mining town as a Special Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings in 1969. The government also applied for it to become a World Heritage Site. The application succeeded in July 2007, although the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOSMOS) did not find any \"outstanding universal value\" of the site."}

Today it is just a narrow strip along the east coast of Queensland. It starts just north of Townsville and continues to just south of Cooktown, a distance of about . \nThe wet tropics cover an area of in 730 separate blocks of land.

It is interesting because it is very old forest, and is a living record of 415 million years of evolution, going back to Pangea and Gondwana.

It is in the South Atlantic Ocean and is made up of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the island group called Tristan da Cunha. In total, there are eight islands and the main is St Helena with a total area for the territory of .\nIt was known as Saint Helena and Dependencies until 1 September 2009. At that time a new constitution gave an equal status to all the islands in the territory.\nHistory.\nOf volcanic origin, the islands of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha were all formerly separate colonies of the English crown, though separately discovered by several Portuguese explorers between 1502 and 1504.\nPortuguese discovery.\nGoing to India, in May 1501, the Portuguese admiral Jo\u00e3o da Nova saw the Ascension island in the South Atlantic. On his return journey, Nova is said to have discovered the South Atlantic island of St\u00a0Helena on 21 May 1502, the feast day of Helena of Constantinople.\nAnother Portuguese, Tristan da Cunha () discovered a group of islands in 1506 and gave its name to the principal island of the group () but it was soon changed to \"Tristan da Cunha\".\nThe Portuguese found that nobody was living in the St\u00a0Helena island, with forests and fresh water. They built a timber chapel in the valley where later Jamestown was built.Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island became very important for ships coming from Asia and going back to Europe.\nEnglish and British colonisation.\nDuring the first years of the 16th century, the island of St Helena was used as a place to stop by the Portuguese, Dutch, English and French on their way to India and other Asian countries.\nThe Netherlands took St Helena from 1645 to 1659. In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St\u00a0Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, and it is from this date that St\u00a0Helena claims to be Britain\u2019s second oldest (remaining) colony (after Bermuda). A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named \"James Fort\" and the town \"Jamestown\", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England.\nIn 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St\u00a0Helena.\nOn 22 April 1834, the island of St\u00a0Helena became a colony of the British crown. In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938 .\nDuring the Second Boer War (1899-1902), the island of St. Helena served as camp for about 5,000 prisoners of war.\nDuring the Second World War, the Ascension was leased to the United States who established a base for their airplanes.\nIn 1961, a volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha forced authorities to evacuate the entire population of the island to the United Kingdom. The people of Tristan da Cunha could not return to the island until 1963.\nGeography.\nThere is a huge distance between the northern and the southern points of the territory. The northern-most island, Ascension, is at latitude of the equator and the southern-most island, Gough Island is at . Between St\u00a0Helena and Tristan da Cunha is the Tropic of Capricorn. The distance between the northern tip of Ascension Island and the southern tip of Gough Island is . The whole territory lies in the Western Hemisphere and has the same time zone: Greenwich Mean Time. Daylight saving time is not observed.\nThere are eight islands in the Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha territory:\nAscension has a warm, arid climate, but it is more moderated (and arid near the sea) in St\u00a0Helena; Tristan da Cunha is much cooler. The highest point of the territory is Queen Mary's Peak on the island of Tristan da Cunha, with an elevation of above sea level.\nAlthough all three parts of the territory were formed by volcanic activity, only the Tristan da Cunha group of islands are active at the moment.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAdministratively, the territory is divided into the same three parts as the territory's geography, namely Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Each is governed by a council. The Governor of the territory is the representative of the British monarch across the territory and presides over the St\u00a0Helena Legislative Council, while he or she is represented by an Administrator on Ascension Island and an Administrator on Tristan da Cunha that preside over these two areas' Island Councils.\nThe island of St Helena is divided into eight districts.\nPeople.\nWith a population of 6,567 inhabitants in the census of 1998 (estimated to be 7,754 in 2013), the territory appears as one of the least populated British territory. The largest city of the territory is the capital, Jamestown, with a population of 1,000 in 2009.\nApproximately 50% of the population are of African origin while the descendants of Europeans (British and Scandinavian) and Chinese each represent a quarter of the population.\nThe inhabitants are mostly Anglicans, but there are Baptists, Adventists and Catholics.\nEconomy.\nThe islands had a very simple economy the mid-1960s, mainly based on the culture of New Zealand flax, a plant of the genus \"Phormium\", that was used to produce fibers and ropes. Agriculture is now mainly for food, except for a bit of coffee.\nFishing remains the only really important activity on the island, but the territory is almost entirely supported by the help from United Kingdom, particularly through the U.S. and British facilities in the Ascension Island, which employ about 25% of the population.\nThe tourism industry in St\u00a0Helena is not well developed and is based on the fact that Napoleon lived and died here."}

The person will be physically inactive and neglect what God has said. Very often, this will lead to resources being wasted. As an example, sloth is about a person not helping those in need, even though they would be able to. Sloth is one of the seven capital sins, which are also called seven deadly sins.\nFor Protestants, Diligence (or hard work) is one of the ways to please God. Max Weber (1864-1920) treats this in his work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. In his work \"Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht\", Immanuel Kant stated that of the capital sins sloth, cowardice and falsehood, the first one is the most despicable. However, he also sees this as a measure of self-protection of the individual, as long phases of hard work will lead a person to become tired, and to make short pauses between intervals of work. Without these pauses, the restles malice that is in the world would do a far greater amount of damage. In 1846, Louis Blanc wrote about the right to work. There was a financial crisis at the time, and many people were unemployed. The crisis led to the French Revolution of 1848.\nIn 1880, the Socialist Paul Lafargue published an essay called \"The Right to be Lazy\", where he explains that the worker should have a right to be lazy."}

Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the book-packaging Stratemeyer Syndicate, created the concept, but the books were written by several ghostwriters over the years under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. \nThe series overview is simple. Frank and Joe Hardy are two high school boys in their late teens. They live in the fictional city of Bayport with their famous private detective father Fenton Hardy. The boys sometimes help their father with his cases, but, at other times, they find and solve their own. The boys have enough money to pursue a WWE Tag Team Championship and are the current holders of the prestigious award. Joe and Scott are renowned for not only there flamboyant appearances, but acrobatic manoeuvres\nIn 1959, the books were revised to eliminate objectionable material, and rewritten in a simpler style. New series were launched in 1987, 1997, and 2005. The original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005. Some stories were adapted for television programs. Critics have offered many explanations for the Hardy Boys popularity including escapism, homosociality, and the triumph of good over evil.\nOverview.\nThe Hardy Boys are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. They live in the fictional city of Bayport on the Atlantic Coast with their father, internationally famous private detective Fenton Hardy. The boys are in their late teens, have their own car, and are in the same grade in high school. Friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper sometimes help the Hardys solve their cases. The boys have enough money to travel around the United States and even the world in pursuit of cases. Frank and Joe are very much alike, but \"Frank was the thinker while Joe was more impulsive, and perhaps a little more athletic.\"\nProduction.\nEdward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, came up with the idea of mystery-solving brothers in 1926. Publishers Grosset &amp; Dunlap approved the idea, and the name \"The Hardy Boys\" was chosen for the series. The books were written under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon, by ghostwriters who signed away their rights to authorship, pseudonyms, and future royalties. The first three books were published in 1927, and were an instant success. By mid-1929, over 115,000 books had been sold. The Stratemeyer Syndicate received all royalties, and their offices handled all correspondence. Public and school libraries agreed to keep the ghostwriters' names secret.\nEvolution of the series.\nThe earliest books are known for their atmosphere, detail, and clear writing style. Between 1938 to 1942 futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations were introduced to the series. The world in these early books is a dark and \"divided place\". Police and authority figures usually come off poorly; the rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish; and racial stereotypes abound. Parents complained and a revision project was undertaken in 1959. Texts were streamlined; stereotypes eliminated; plots were rewritten, lurid elements deleted, chapters per book were reduced, slang and difficult words were deleted, and the writing style was tightened. The revised versions focused on non-stop action rather than atmosphere and suspense, and were meant for a younger audience with short attention spans. Commentators thought the originals had been \"gutted\".\nThereafter, the books became more respectful of law and authority. Villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes involving guns and shoot-outs were removed. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and law: they drove within the speed limit, for example, even in pursuit of a villain. The Hardys became upscale and lost touch with the typical boy who bought their books. They became \"members and agents of the adult ruling class, acting on behalf of that ruling class.\"\nNew series were launched in the last decades of the 20th century: the Hardy Boys Casefiles in 1987 and the Clues Brothers in 1997. The boys have distinct personalities and carry guns in the Casefiles series. The long-running Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005, and was replaced with \"The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers\". In these books, the boys take turns narrating their adventures, and are given their cases by a secret group called American Teens Against Crime (ATAC). The Hardys were also featured in a graphic novel series (2005), and a chapter book series for early readers called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files (2010).\nSales.\nThe Hardy Boys have been called \"a cultural touchstone all over the world\". The books have been translated into over 25 languages. The books have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000\u00a0books had been sold, and as of 2008 the books were selling over a million copies a year. The first Hardy Boys book, \"The Tower Treasure\", sells over 100,000\u00a0copies a year. Worldwide, over 70\u00a0million copies of Hardy Books have been sold.\nThe longest-running series of books to feature the Hardy Boys is the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories, sometimes also called the Hardy Boys Mysteries. The series ran from 1927 to 2005 and comprises 190 books. Some consider only the first 58 volumes of this series to be part of the Hardy Boys canon. The Hardy Boys also appeared in 127 volumes of the Casefiles series and are the heroes of the Undercover Brothers series. The Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent \"a victory over anxiety\". The series teaches readers that \"although the world can be an out-of-control place, good \"can\" triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others.\"\nParodies.\nThe various Hardy Boys series offer readers an escape from the everyday world into one of mystery and adventure with two self-controlled, gentlemanly, homosocial, idealized young white males who are the equals of their father (and other men) in intelligence and powers of deduction. Their ignorance of sex, their \"squareness\" (socially conventional), their respect for the law, and their homosociality have generated parodies such as \"The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From\", \"The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical\", and \"A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery\".\nReading list.\n1. tower treasure\n2. house on cliff\n3. secret of old mill\n4. missing chums\n5. hidden gold\n6. shore road\n7. caves\n8. cabin island\n9. airport\n10. midnight\n11. clock\n12. footprins"}

That means we know for certain it was caused by an asteroid or meteorite strike. The crater is in the Free State Province of South Africa. \nIn 2005, the Vredefort Dome was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as a natural site of geologic interest.\nFormation and structure.\nThe asteroid that hit Vredefort was one of the largest ever to strike Earth since the Hadean eon. The Vredefort hit was some two billion years ago. The bolide is thought to have been about 5\u201310 km (3\u20136 miles) in diameter. \nThe crater has a diameter of roughly , larger than the Sudbury Basin and the Chicxulub crater. This makes Vredefort the largest known impact structure on Earth. If the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica is an impact crater then it is the largest known at diameter.\nThe Vredefort crater's age is about two billion (109) years ago, which puts it in the Palaeoproterozoic era. It is the second-oldest known crater on Earth, a little less than 300 million years younger than the Suavj\u00e4rvi crater in Russia. In comparison, it is about 10% older than the Sudbury Basin impact (at 1.849 billion years).\nIt was originally thought that the crater was formed by a volcanic explosion, but in the mid 1990s evidence showed that it was the site of a huge bolide impact. Telltale shatter cones were discovered in the bed of the nearby Vaal River. \nThe Vredefort crater site is one of the few multi-ringed impact craters on Earth, although they are more common elsewhere in the Solar System. Perhaps the best-known example is Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto, although Earth's Moon has a number as well. Geological processes, such as erosion and plate tectonics, have destroyed most multi-ring craters on Earth.\nThe nearby Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) and Witwatersrand Basin were created during this same period, leading to speculation that the bolide was big and fast enough to cause local volcanism. The BIC is where most of the world's known reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs) are found, while the Witwatersrand basin holds most of the known reserves of gold.\nThe Vredefort dome in the center of the crater is home to three towns: Parys, Vredefort and Koppies."}

The other is the Naracoorte Caves National Park in South Australia. The Riversleigh site is part of the Boodjamulla National Park. The fossil site covers an area of about 100\u00a0km\u00b2.\nThe fossils that have been found are the remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene epochs. The site was listed as a World Heritage site in 1994. The fossils at Riversleigh are rare because they are found in soft freshwater limestone which has not been compressed. This means the animal remains retain their three dimensional shape.\nFossils.\nFossils at Riversleigh are found in limestone by lime-rich freshwater pools, and in caves. They are from when the ecosystem was evolving from rich rainforest to semi-arid grassland. Thirty-five fossil bat species have been found at the site, which is the richest in the world. A skull, complete with all its teeth, of a 15 million-year-old monotreme, \"Obdurodon dicksoni\", shows how this Australia group of animals evolved. Fossil ancestors of the extinct thylacine, \"Thylacinus cynocephalus\", have also been found at Riversleigh. In 1993, \"Nimbadon\" skulls were found in newly discovered cave. Scientists think this prehistoric marsupial first appeared about 15 million years ago and died out about 12 million years ago, perhaps from the effects of climate change. Other fossils have shown how the koala has changed in response to Australia's change from rainforest to drier eucalypt forests."}

It is part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. UNESCO named the dome a World Heritage Site in 1996. The dome is the ruined Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall. It was kept as a memorial to the people who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The bombing killed 70,000 people instantly, and another 70,000 died later from the radiation.\nHistory.\nCzech architect Jan Letzel designed the building. It was completed in April 1915 and was named the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition. It was opened to the public in August that year. In 1921 the name was changed to the Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall. Finally in 1933, the name changed to the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. \nAtomic bombing.\nAt 8:15 on August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb to be used in war exploded almost directly above the dome. Everyone inside the building was killed instantly,but the building was not totally destroyed. There was more downward force on the building, but less side-to-side force right under the center of the explosion.\nAfter the war.\nAt first, the city planned to tear down the building, but did not because it was not as badly damaged. Some people wanted to remove the building, but others wanted to keep it. The city of Hiroshima was rebuilt around the ruined dome. In 1966 the city said that it planned to keep the building. As of July 2011, two construction projects kept the Dome from falling.\nIn December 1996, UNESCO added the A-Bomb Dome to the World Heritage List. Not everyone supported this decision. The United States did not join the decision. China said that the monument could take attention away from the countries that were victims of Japan during the war. Many more people died because of Japanese attacks in those countries. The United States said that having a memorial to a war site would not tell the whole history of the bombing."}

But sometimes preteens (people under 13) can become pregnant as well. The fact that teenagers become pregnant is related to many factors. These are related to the specific situation of the teenager, and the group that she interacts with. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary from country to country and are related to differences of sexual activities, the general sex education and contraceptives being available. Teen pregnancy will sometimes involve low birth weight. Social matters also play a role: Often, the teenager grew up in poverty. She also often has a lower level of general education. Pregnancy in teenagers in the developed world usually occurs outside of marriage. The lowest levels of teenage pregnancy are in Japan and South Korea. Teenage pregnancies are common among Romani people. Bulgaria and Romania have the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe.\nProblems.\nMedicalities.\nTeenage pregnancies have a number of problems:\nPotential Solutions.\nEducation.\nA large cause of teenage pregnancy is a lack of education about sex and pregnancy. The first to be blamed are schools and teachers, but the real starting point should be from within the family. Sometimes parents might think talking about sex is inappropriate or that it is automatically encouraging their children to have sex, so they avoid talking about it entirely. This leaves kids with information only from their peers, which often includes pressure to engage in sex acts to meet social standards. Parents should realize that in attempting to protect their children from the reality of human sexuality they are causing more harm than good. Open discussion about sex in a safe, nonjudgmental environment is essential to helping minors make educated decisions about sex. Pediatricians also take it upon themselves to make up for the information that has not been properly communicated to teens, and continually recognize better education as the key to helping reduce teen pregnancy.\nReferences.\n&lt;link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:Biological_reproduction\" /&gt;"}

It involved two trains, one run by Thames Trains, the other by First Great Western.\nEvents.\nA train run by Thames Trains left London Paddington railway station for Bedwyn in Wiltshire at 08:06am. \nIt was a \"Thames Turbo\", painted in Network SouthEast colours and made up of three carriages. \nAt Ladbroke Grove Junction, trains switched onto the usual route, one track for trains away from London, the other for trains to London. \nIt should have stopped at a red signal and waited until it could do this safely, but it failed to stop at the signal (called a Signal Passed at Danger or SPAD). \nIt collided nearly head on with a train run by First Great Western from Cheltenham Spa in Gloucestershire, after the signal that was changed failed to stop the train.\nThe train was a diesel high speed train, with 8 coaches and two locomotives, one at each end. \nThe front two coaches of the Thames Turbo were completely destroyed, and the front locomotive of the High Speed Train was badly damaged. \nThe diesel fuel in the Thames Turbo was scattered as a result and caught fire, which caused separate fires to burn in the wreckage, especially in Coach H of the high speed train which was completely burned by the fire. \nThe drivers of both trains were killed in the crash. Altogether, 31 people died: 24 people on the Thames Turbo and 6 people on the high speed train were killed by the crash itself, while another person was killed by the fire. 523 people were injured, of which 227 were taken to hospital. The remaining 296 people were treated where the crash happened.\nCause.\nThe immediate cause was the Thames Turbo failing to stop at a red signal at Ladbroke Grove Junction. A signal before it was amber, which should have prepared the driver for the red signal. Because the driver was killed, it was hard to find out why he did not stop at the signal. An inquiry was held in 2000 by Lord Cullen, one year later.\nContributing factors.\nLord Cullen took note of the fact that the railway line in London Paddington was prone to trains failing to stop at the same red signal that the Thames Turbo passed. \nOne reason for the driver not stopping was that it was difficult for him to see the signal. It was very early in the morning and the sun was very low in the sky. This made the amber signal difficult to notice. Overhead power lines had been put up for the Heathrow Express to run, which obscured the signals even more.\nThe crash also happened shortly after the Thames Turbo driver had qualified, after his 2 weeks of training. The trainer did not tell him about the signal and later claimed that he was \"not there to teach the routes\" and was \"totally there to teach how to drive a Turbo\". Thames Trains also had no standardised test system for drivers, and no clear pass or fail criteria. The driver had been in the Navy and had little experience on the railways, and had qualified 13 days earlier than British Rail drivers did (British Rail also did not allow new drivers to drive on difficult routes such as the Great Western Main Line between London and Bristol, on which this accident happened, until they got experience on easier routes).\nAnother reason was that the Thames Turbo had been fitted with a safety system called ATP (automatic train protection), which would have stopped the train if it failed to stop at a red signal, but it was switched off. The High Speed Train's ATP was also off. Although it was recommended after a rail crash at Clapham Junction many years earlier, it had proved annoying in the past and no company required its trains to have it working and switched on.\nAfter the event.\nOn 5 April 2004, Thames Trains was fined \u00a32 million for breaching Health &amp; Safety laws in connection with the crash. \nOn 31 October 2006, 7 years and 26 days after the crash, Network Rail pleaded guilty to charges under the Health &amp; Safety at Work act 1974, was fined \u00a34 million and ordered to pay a further \u00a3225,000. \nBoth the front locomotive of the high speed train and the Thames Turbo were written off. The back carriage of the Thames Turbo, however, is now a spare part.\nA memorial garden was created next to the Great Western main line near Paddington station, near the car park of a Sainsbury's supermarket."}

At West Palm Beach, it runs parallel to Interstate 95, and then in Orlando, it crosses Interstate 4, to its northern end at Interstate 75 near Wildwood.\nThe Turnpike itself has two sections. The first is the Mainline, a route from the Golden Glades Interchange (north of Miami) to Wildwood. This has the hidden designation of State Road 91 (SR 91). It was opened in stages between 1957 and 1964. The second is the long Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT). This was completed in 1974. Its hidden designation is State Road 821 (SR 821). This runs from Florida City (near Homestead) through the suburbs to the west and north of Miami, connecting to the Mainline four miles (6\u00a0km) north of the Golden Glades Interchange. Florida's Turnpike is considered one of the busiest highways in the country (according to the IBBTA, the highway is the nation's 3rd most heavily traveled toll road)."}

The blue is for hope. The red is for energy or dynamism of the people. The colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) is for the sun, sea, and sand.

He was depicted as having an oversized and permanent erection. Sources differ as to who his parents were. Some say he was the son of the god Dionysus and the goddess Aphrodite; Dionysus and Chione; Hermes and Aphrodite; Zeus and Aphrodite; or Pan and Aphrodite. According to the myth, Hera cursed him while he was still in the womb of Aphrodite, because she was jealous that the Trojan prince Paris had picked Aphrodite as being the most beautiful of the goddesses and had given the Golden Apple of Eris to her. Hera's curse made Priapus impotent, ugly and foul-minded. The gods did not want Priapus to live with them on Olympus, and he was left on a hillside on Earth. There, he was taken by shepherds who raised him. Priapus later tried to rape the goddess Hestia, but was hit by a donkey, and this caused Priapus to lose his erection.\nHe also became the patron god of merchant sailing, protecting and guiding them through rough seas. It was common for merchants to carry a Priapus figure or a phallus on their ships as protection."}

The term is also used for other similar flatworms. They are fresh water animals which move in a smooth wave-like manner. Planaria are free-living. They can live in fresh water or very damp soil, depending on the type. \n\"Planaria\" are hermaphrodite: they produce both eggs and sperm. To reproduce, a planarian releases eggs and sperm into the water, where the eggs get fertilized. Planaria can repair damage by regenerating any part of their body. \n\"Planaria\" are the one of most simple creatures to develop a nervous system. Their nervous system consists of ganglia under the eyespots and a cord of nerves that run down the body, under the gut (ventral nerve cord). The three pairs of ganglia under the eyespots make a inverted U shape that have nerves sticking out to the outside of the head so that the head of the planarian is more sensitive than the rest of the body. If the light hits the animal near the eyespots, they usually move away into darker water. \nThe digestive system of \"Planaria\" consist of a mouth a pharynx and a gut cavity. Its mouth is on the underside of the body. Digestive enzymes are released from the mouth onto the food to soften it, Then the half digested food is sucked up the pharynx and into the stomach. From there the nutrients diffuse into the rest of the body. \nThere are no circulatory or respiratory systems. Oxygen enters and carbon dioxide leaves the planarian's body by diffusing through the body wall. \"Planaria\" do not have a skeleton. They have an extendable crumpled muscle that allows them to move. Also, planarians have three layers of body-wall muscles that are constructed of circular muscle fibers as well as longer muscle threads.\nPlanarians have both ovaries and testes. To reproduce, they can have sex with another planarian; this is called sexual reproduction. Another way planarians reproduce is called asexual reproduction. This is when a planarian splits and regenerates the parts that are missing. However, asexual reproduction is uncommon."}

The area was originally called the Severn Gorge.\nThe area was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, because the industrial revolution started around here in the mid-1700s.\nIronbridge Gorge has mines, factories, workers' housing, and the transport infrastructure that was created in the gorge during the Industrial Revolution. Coke production in the area helped start the Industrial Revolution. The Iron Bridge was the world's first bridge built from iron.\nHistory.\nThe gorge takes its name from its famous \"Iron Bridge\", the first iron bridge of its kind in the world. It is a monument to the industry that began there. The bridge was built in 1779 to link the industrial town of Broseley with the smaller mining town of Madeley and the growing industrial centre of Coalbrookdale.\nThe Iron Bridge was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron. a material which was previously far too expensive to use for large structures. However, a new blast furnace nearby lowered the cost. This encouraged local engineers and architects to solve a long-standing problem of a crossing over the river.\nThere are two reasons the site was so useful to the early industrialists. The raw materials, coal, iron ore, limestone and clay, for the manufacture of iron, tiles and porcelain are exposed or easily mined in the gorge. Second, the deep and wide river allowed easy transport of products to the sea."}

They were placed at cross-roads and on the borders of lands as protection. \nIn Athens, they were placed outside houses, temples and gymnasiums for good luck and to avert harmful or bad influences, like the evil eye. They would be adorned with garlands, wreaths, offerings and anointed with oil to obtain luck and protection."}

For other people called Tipton, see Tipton (disambiguation).\"\nBilly Lee Tipton (December 29, 1914 \u2013 January 21, 1989) was an American jazz musician and bandleader. Tipton had been assigned female gender at birth.\nEarly life.\nTipton was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. His aunt raised him after his parents' divorced. He became interested in music in high school, especially jazz. He studied piano and saxophone. He went back to Oklahoma for his last year of high school and joined the school band there. His nickname in high school was \"Tippy\".\nTipton later took his father's nickname, Billy, when he started a music career. He also began to try to appear to be male by dressing to hide his breasts. At first, Tipton only behaved as a male while performing. However, by 1940 Tipton was living as a man all the time. Very few people knew both sides of his life. They were two of his female cousins and maybe his later lovers.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nIn 1936, Tipton lead a band playing on the radio station, KFXR. In 1938, Tipton joined Louvenie\u2019s Western Swingbillies. This band played on another rado station, KTOK, and at Brown's Tavern. In 1940, Tipton was touring the Midwest and playing at dances with Scott Cameron's band. Starting in 1941, he played for two and a half years at Joplin, Missouri's Cotton Club with George Meyer's band. He then toured for a time with Ross Carlyle. Later, he played for two years in Texas.\nIn 1949, Tipton began touring the Pacific Northwest with George Meyer. A local radio station recorded the band's appearances at Roseburg, Oregon's Shalimar Room. Recordings of Tipton's early playing include \"If I Knew Then\" and \"Sophisticated Swing\". The band was well known for the song \"Flying Home\". They played the song like Benny Goodman's band did.\nGeorge Meyer's band became more successful, and they began getting better chances to perform. They played with The Ink Spots, the Delta Rhythm Boys, and Billy Eckstine at the Boulevard Club in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\nBandleader.\nTipton began playing piano alone at the Elks club in Longview, Washington. In Longview, he started the Billy Tipton Trio. This band was Tipton on piano, Dick O'Neil on drums, and Kenny Richards (and later Ron Kilde) on bass. The trio became popular in the area.\nA talent scout from Tops Records heard them play at King's Supper Club in Santa Barbara, California and got them a contract to record songs. The Billy Tipton Trio made two albums of jazz standards for Tops, \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" and \"Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano\", in 1957. The albums sold 17,678 copies. This was a good number for a small independent record label.\nAfter the albums' success, the Holiday Hotel in Reno, Nevada asked them to become play there regularly. Tops Records asked the trio to record four more albums. Tipton said no both offers. Instead, he moved to Spokane, Washington worked as an agent. The trio played every week at Allen's Tin Pan Alley as the house band. He played mainly swing standards and less jazz, even though he preferred jazz. His performances also included skits like vaudeville performers did. He imitated celebrities like Liberace and Elvis Presley. In some of these comedy skits, he played a little girl. He helped young musicians at the Dave Sobol Theatrical Agency.\nIn the late 1970s, Tipton's arthritis got worse and he had to retire from music.\nPersonal life.\nEarly in his career, Tipton appeared as a male only as a musician. He appeared as a woman at other times. He lived with a woman named Non Earl Harrell. Other musicians thought this was a lesbian relationship. The relationship ended in 1942. Tipton's next relationship was with a singer known only as \"June\". This lasted for several years.\nThen, or seven years, Tipton lived with a young woman named Betty Cox. She was 19 when they started their relationship. Cox said they had a heterosexual relationship. Betty remembered Tipton as \"the most fantastic love of my life.\" Tipton kept the secret of his physical sexual characteristics a secret from Betty with a story. Tipton said that he had been in a serious car accident which had badly damaged his genitals and broken some ribs. He said he had to wear bandages protect his damaged chest. He told his female partners this story later in his life. Tipton was never legally married, but several women had drivers' licenses naming them Mrs. Tipton. \nIn 1960, Tipton ended the relationship with Cox. He settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper, Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes). Her professional name was \"The Irish Venus.\" They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton died, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, \u201cHe gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a musician.\u201d She was taking about trying to be part of 1920\u221230s music industry. His son William described Tipton as a good father who loved to go on Scout camping trips.\nThey had trouble with their adopted sons during their adolescence. The couple often argued over how they should raise the boys. Tipton left Kitty in the late 1970s and moved into a mobile home with their sons. He restarted an old relationship with Maryann. He was poor, but stayed there until his death.\nDeath and after.\nIn 1989, at the age of 74, Tipton had medical problems. He said it was emphysema and refused to call a doctor. Actually he had a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer. He died because he did not get medical care for this serious problem. His son William watched while paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life. That is how William learned that his father was born female. Tipton was pronounced dead at Valley General Hospital. The coroner shared the secret with the rest of the family. Kitty had his body to be cremated so that nobody would find out, but one of their sons did not keep the secret. A newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and wire services picked it up. Stories about Tipton appeared in papers including tabloids such as \"National Enquirer\" and \"Star\", as well as more serious papers such as \"New York Magazine\" and \"The Seattle Times\". Tipton's family even made talk show appearances.\nWorks inspired by Tipton.\n\"Kill Me, Por Favor\" is a short story including a section about Billy Tipton in Ry Cooder's 2011 volume entitled \"Los Angeles Stories\". Pub. City Lights Books 2011."}

They feed on the acidic bacteria from vinegar and other things, like fermented apples. They range from 1mm to 10mm long or larger. These nematodes go through a six-stage life cycle. The stages are: an egg, four larval stages, and reaching adulthood. They live about 10 months.\nAnatomy.\nThe nematode's reproductive system is sexual. Female vinegar eels have ovaries and produce eggs. Their reproductive system is in the form of a tube. The females also have a short sac-like seminal receptacle that stores sperm. A fertilized egg hatches in the uterus before leaving the womb. Vinegar eels give birth to as many as 45 babies every 8-10 days. A male vinegar eels\u2019 reproductive system is smaller than the female\u2019s. They have testis and a vas deferens. The testes open into a wide sperm duct and then into a muscular duct which can push out the sperm. The duct empties into a cloaca. \nNematodes, such as the vinegar eels, have no circulatory system. Through their body\u2019s wall, gas and excretion waste are diffused. Oxygen from the outside environment is diffused into the body, and carbon dioxide is diffused out of the body. Vinegar eels have to live in liquids that have enough oxygen so that it can diffuse into their bodies.\nAging research.\nExperiments with \"T. aceti\" were done to understand the cause of ageing. DNA damage accumulates when the rate of damage occurrence is more than the rate of DNA repair. Accumulation of DNA damage leads to a decline in gene expression. There is a consistent decline in DNA repair capacity with age in the nematode. A second report measured the ability to repair DNA damage in young and old nematodes after exposure to ionizing radiation. They observed that the old nematodes were strikingly less able to carry out this type of DNA repair than young nematodes. These experiments suggest that a decline in DNA repair capability occurs with age. This is the \"DNA damage theory of aging\"."}

It has a population of 231 (2011) and an area of 9,15 km2 (density : 25,2/km2). Its patron saint is Saint Anna, mother of Saint Mary and therefore, grandmother of Jesus. \nHistory.\nThe Castle of Ribalonga was a fortress that probably began to be inhabited on the Iron Age and continued on the Ancient Rome.\nRibalonga belonged on the 13th century to the parish of Vila Ch\u00e3, on 1839 to Vila Real, on 1852 to Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada and on 1872 to Alij\u00f3.\nLegends.\nLegend of the red cross.\nThe legend tells that in the year 2000, a man of the family Sampaio, whose descendants still live in the village, coming from the fair of Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, brought with him some meat. Suddenly, he was followed by a pack of wolves and he became very scared, because he realized that the wolves were very hungry. When he arrived near the village, the wolves began to close the circle. When he saw himself lost, he got off his horse and knelt and asked the Lord of the Afflicted to save him from the wolves. At this moment, the dogs in the house of Mr. Sampaio began barking anxiously and the wife of the man let them go. They ran fast to the place where the man was and drove the wolves away. In recognition, he built a cross where he asked the Lord to help. A few days later, one of the dogs appeared, all hurt.\nThis cross can be seen today, a little bit degraded, on the place that has the name \"Red Cross\" and that is in the South of Ribalonga.\nLegend of St. Ana.\nThere is another legend of Ribalonga, referring to its place of St. Ana. There is a huge rock, rectangular, with three grooves at the top, the head, the torso and the limbs of a person.\nThe voice of the people, that same voice that describes the legends word by word, says that these signs were left there by St. Ana when she was on pilgrimage to holy places.\nThe legend tells that St. Ana, very tired and seeing no other place to lie down, took this rock to rest. And so the stone became soft for her to be comfortable and cosy, taking the shape of her body. And the next day, at dawn, her forces restored, she continued her journey. After that, people began to pass the rock to go to work and, noticing the furrows, they were amazed. Nobody knows how they came to the conclusion that it was St. Ana. Was it because they were devotees? No one can answer, the fact is that currently the village patron saint is St. Ana and the hills and the land around the place where the famous rock is, are known as \"Santa Ana\".\nGeography.\nRibalonga borders to Rapadoura, Vila Verde, Pop\u00falo, Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Vila Ch\u00e3 and to the region of Douro. It has a lot of mountains, hills, pines and it's very stony.\nCulture.\nThe cuisine of Ribalonga is based on meat. There are a lot of different specialities like \"cozido \u00e0 portuguesa\" ('Portuguese stew'), \"feijoada \u00e0 transmontana\" (rice and black beans), \"alheiras\" or \"lingui\u00e7as\" (both sausages).

As for Grevenmacher, the first town was behind the Holy Cross Chapel at the place called \"Buerggruef\", not far from the Roman road to the city of Luxembourg.\nA few centuries later, the Counts of Luxembourg chose a safe place to protect their land against the powerful archbishops of Trier. They found it in Grevenmacher, that was the place where the road going from the city of Luxembourg to Trier meet with the one going from Trier to Thionville. Here a strong fortress was built, probably on the orders of Count Henry V.

Members of the family Ichneumonidae are usually larger than members of the Braconidae, and the family has three times as many species as the braconids.

Being in the same order, ichneumonoids are closely related to other hymenoptera such as ants and bees. Many species in both families use polydnaviruses (with double strand DNA) to suppress the immune system of the host insect.\nSome species use many different insects as hosts, others are very specific in host choice. Various ichneumons are used successfully as biological control agents in controlling pests such as flies or beetles.\nIchneumon wasp species are highly varied, ranging from to long. Most are slender, with the females of many species (particularly in the genus \"Megarhyssa\") having an extremely long ovipositor for laying eggs. The female finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. Upon hatching, the larval ichneumon feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when they themselves are ready to pupate. Despite looking formidable, the ovipositor does not deliver a sting like many wasps or bees. It can be used by the wasps to bore through rotten wood, and lay eggs in grubs hiding under the wood."}

To the west, it includes the Valdivia through Tierra del Fuego archipelago.\nThe name Patagonia is from the word \"patag\u00f3n\" used by Magellan in 1520. The word was for the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. Now people think the Patagons were actually Tehuelches. They had an average height of 180\u00a0cm (~5\u203211\u2033) compared to the 155\u00a0cm (~5\u20321\u2033) average for Spaniards of the time.\nAnimals.\nThe guanaco, the cougar, the Patagonian fox, the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk, and the Magellanic Tuco-tuco are the most common mammals of the Patagonian plains. There are also many birds. Southern Caracara, Austral parakeets, and Green-backed Firecrowns are some. Waterfowl include Chilean Flamingo, Upland Goose, and steamer ducks.\nFamous marine fauna include the southern right whale, the Magellanic Penguin, the orca and elephant seals. The Vald\u00e9s Peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its importance as a nature reserve."}

It is the largest species of snail. Apple snails are most commonly found in Africa, South and Central America, West Indies, Southern USA, and Asia, but can be found all over the world. They are well adapted to their region and therefore can also be sold as pets and bought at most pet stores in the US. Apple snails are the preferred type of pet snail because of their appearance and size. Apple snails are also called golden mystery snails, golden snails, and mystery snails.\nHabitat.\nApple snails live in water. They prefer water temperatures between 18\u00b0-28\u00b0 Celsius, or 65\u00b0-82\u00b0 Fahrenheit. They eat things like fresh fruits, lettuce, other vegetables, algae and wafers. However, they are not called apple snails because they eat apples. They get their name from the fact that one species of apple snails can grow to be the size of an apple. Apple snails are also common aquarium pets because of their size. They also prefer to be with other snails. They are good pets because they can live in almost any water condition, for example, water with low/high levels of oxygen, and various temperatures. Although they can live in water with high oxygen, this makes them move slower.\nAnatomy.\nA snail has a basic anatomy like any other mollusk. They have a shell, a nervous system, a circulatory system, a respiratory system, and a reproductive system. The circulatory system has an open heart system, which pumps blood which flows over all of the organs in the snails body without veins or arteries. The respiratory system includes gills and lungs. They need gills to be able to live in water. They have lungs because their bodies adapted to their environment because of frequent droughts; so they need lungs to breathe during the droughts. Their nervous system includes their brain, which controls their body. They are one of the only species of snails that are not hermaphrodites. Each gender has its own reproductive parts.\nFood and Digestion.\nApple snails are herbivores, so they eat mostly aquatic vegetation, and algae. In captivity, they are commonly fed fish food, along with supplements of rotting organic waste, such as vegetables.. To digest food, apple snails first break up food with the radula teeth, and then the food will be swallowed, and travel down the esophagus and to the stomach. It will eventually exit through the anus as feces. Apple snails will eat most aquatic vegetation, and can \"ruin\" the look of an aquarium very quickly, as they are scavengers.\nThe heart.\nApple snails have an open circulatory system. This means that the heart pumps blood, but instead of it pumping through veins and arteries like humans have, the blood washes over the organs, and the organs absorb it on contact. After the blood is pumped and the nutrients have been absorbed, it flows back to the heart to take the carbon dioxide away and to get new oxygen.\nReproductive System.\nThe apple snails are not hermaphrodite, like most snails, meaning that they have two genders.\nThe male snail has two kinds of sperm. One is for attaching onto the female's egg, and the function of the other sperm is unknown.\nThe female's eggs are stored in the \"ovaria\" which is near the digestive gland. It goes to the receptaculum seminis, where the male's sperm is stored. The eggs are fertilized here. Then, after the eggs are fertilized, they are sent to the shell gland which will give the eggs a protective shell. After, they shall continue down their tube and leave the mother's body, waiting to be hatched."}

The list of problems turned out to be very influential. After Hilbert's death, another problem was found in his writings; this is sometimes known as Hilbert's 24th problem today. This problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible.\nOf the 23 problems, three were unresolved in 2012, three were too vague to be resolved, and six could be partially solved. Given the influence of the problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute formulated a similar list, called the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.\nSummary.\nThe formulation of certain problems is better than that of others. \nOf the cleanly-formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus. On the other hand, problems 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 18+, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but there exists some controversy as to whether it resolves the problem.\nThe solution for problem 18, the Kepler conjecture, uses a computer-assisted proof. This is controversial, because a human reader is unable to verify the proof in reasonable time. \nThat leaves 16, 8 (the Riemann hypothesis) and 12 unresolved. On this classification 4, 16, and 23 are too vague to ever be described as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also be in this class. 6 is considered as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics.\nTable of problems.\nHilbert's twenty-three problems are:\nOther websites.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0source texts, documents, translations, media"}

That way they will either be classified as substitutes or complementary goods. Two goods are substitutes if the demand of one good increases and the price of the other good increases. In this case, consumers will replace one good with the other. \nClassic examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, or tea and coffee. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demand for the two kinds of good will be bound together by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if they get an advantage by to do so.\nPerfect substitutes can replace each other, without trade-off in costs, or quality. For imperfect substitutes, the customer has to make a trade-off, either in price, or in quality. Artificial leather is much cheaper than real leather, and can replace it in many situations - artificial and real leather are substitute goods. Real leather is much more durable, and has a different look and feel. When these factors are important, the two are not interchangeable. For this reason artificial and real leather are imperfect substitutes."}

He has a fling with 36-year-old Alex Forrest (played by Close). Alex has borderline personality disorder and self-harms. When Dan ends the affair, she refuses to accept it and reacts with hatred against him and later tells him she is pregnant. Despite him moving to Bedford, New York, she stalks him and uses violence. Dan then approaches the police for a restraining order against her, but the lieutenant claims that he cannot violate Alex's rights without probable cause and must own up to his own adultery.\nOne day, when Dan and his family are out, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit and leaves it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan confesses to the affair and of Alex's pregnancy. Beth then kicks Dan out, but not before he calls Alex to tell her of Beth's knowledge of the affair.

It is named after Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who first had this idea. Kepler supposed that the ways to pack spheres of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are face-centered cubic or hexagonal packings. Those two things are crystal structures, meaning ways to put things together in a repeating pattern. These packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent, this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available."}

Very often, the spheres all have the same size, and the space used is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem is part of packing problems. When it is generalised, not all the spheres need to have the same size, and spaces can be n-dimensional Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space.\nA typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume."}

{"id": "341852", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341852", "title": "M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle", "text": "The Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was a group of American automatic rifles and light machine guns. It was used by the United States and several other countries. The most-used type of BAR was the M1918. It was designed by John Browning in 1917. It was supposed to replace the French Chauchat and the M1909 Benet-Mercie machine guns.\nThe BAR was designed to be carried by soldiers that were moving forward. It was supposed to be put over the shoulder on a strap and fired from the hip. This was called \"walking fire\". It was thought that walking fire was needed for trench warfare. However, it was usually used as a light machine gun and fired from a bipod.\nHistory.\nWhen the United States joined World War I, they did not have very good machine guns. One reason for this was because there was no military doctrine for their use. The U.S. declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. At this time, the commanders were told that the U.S. only had 670 M1909 Benet-Mercies, 282 M1904 Maxims and 158 Colts, M1895 to fight the war. After a lot of arguments, they decided that the U.S. would have to build up more American weapons. However, until then, U.S. soldiers would have to take what the French and British could give them. The machine guns given to the U.S. by the French were often not very good. They also fired different cartridges from what the U.S. soldiers usually used. This meant that soldiers and machine gunners had to be given different kinds of cartridge.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1917, before the United States joined the First World War, John Browning brought two weapons to Washington, D.C. These were: a water-cooled machine gun (later named the M1917 Browning machine gun) and an automatic rifle. Back then, this automatic rifle was called the Browning Machine Rifle or BMR. Both of these weapons fired the standard U.S. cartridge. John Browning had set up a demonstration of the weapons at Congress Heights. Congress Heights is just outside of Washington D.C. On 27 February 1917, Browning tested the automatic rifle in front of 300 people. The crowd was so impressed that he was immediately given a contract for the weapon. It was quickly brought into service. The water-cooled machine gun was tested further.\nMore tests were done for U.S. Army weapon officers at Springfield Armory in May 1917. Both weapons were recommended to be brought into service immediately. So that the BAR was not confused with the M1917 machine gun, it was officially named the M1918 or Rifle, Caliber .30, Automatic, Browning, M1918. On 16 July 1917, 12,000 BARs were ordered from Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company. They were allowed to make the BAR under Browning's patents (Browning's patent 1293022 was owned by Colt). However, Colt was already making as many weapons as they could (as they were making the Vickers machine gun for the British Army). They asked for the military to wait a while, as they were opening a new factory in Meriden, Connecticut. Because of how much the weapon was needed, the request was turned down. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company (WRAC) would make the weapons instead. Winchester also helped out with the BAR's final design.\nMaking of the M1918.\nSince work on the gun did not begin until February 1918, Winchester was hurrying to make many BARs. They were in such a rush that the first 1,800 guns were delivered with things wrong. The contract with Winchester said that they had to make 25,000 BARs. Winchester were making many BARs by June 1918. By July, they were making 9,000 guns a month.\nColt and Marlin-Rockwell Corp. also began making BARs just after Winchester started making a lot of them. Marlin-Rockwell had a contract to make BARs for the Belgian government. They bought the Mayo Radiator Co.'s factory. They only used it to make the BAR. The first BAR from Marlin-Rockwell was delivered on 11 June 1918. The company eventually started making 200 BARs per day. Colt had only made 9,000 BARs when the armistice was signed. This was because they were busy with other orders. Together, the three companies made 706 BARs every day. Around 52,000 BARs were delivered by all companies by the end of WWI. Between 1918 and 1919, 102,125 BARs were made. Colt made 16,000, Winchester made 47,123 and Marlin-Rockwell made 39,002 BARs.\nBy July 1918, the BAR had arrived in France. The first unit to get BARs was the U.S. Army's 79th Infantry Division. The division used them for the first time on 13 September 1918. Even though it was brought in very late in the war, the BAR made a large effect. It was used a lot during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The other Allies were impressed by the BAR. France asked for 15,000 BARs to replace their Chauchat.\nDesign.\nThe M1918 is a selective fire automatic rifle. It fires from an open bolt.\nThe weapon's barrel can not be removed quickly. The M1918 gets its ammunition from a 20-round box magazine. 40-round magazines were also used to shoot down aircraft. However, these stopped being used in 1927. Not many bayonets for the BAR were made. Because of this, they are very rare.\nBecause the M1918 was supposed to be used as a support weapon, it did not have a place to put a bayonet. No bayonets were ever used on a BAR. Winchester did make one BAR with a place to put a bayonet, but it was only for testing.\nDifferent types of M1918.\nDuring its long time in service, the M1918 was developed further and further. It was upgraded many times. The first big try at making the M1918 better made the M1922 light machine gun. The M1922 was taken into service with the United States Cavalry in 1922. The weapon used a new type of barrel. It also had a bipod with spikes on the end. The handguard was also changed.\nIn 1931, the Colt Arms Co. made the Colt Monitor Automatic Machine Rifle (R 80). This was mostly meant to be used by prison guards and the police. The Colt Monitor did not have a bipod. The Colt Monitor weighed around 16\u00a0lb. 3\u00a0oz. without any ammunition in it. It had a rate of fire of around 500\u00a0rpm. Around 125 Colt Monitor automatic rifles were made. 90 of these were bought by the FBI. Eleven rifles went to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. The rest went to many prisons, banks, security companies and police departments.\nIn 1932, a much shorter version of the M1918 BAR designed for 'bush warfare' was made by USMC Major H.L. Smith. Captain Merritt A. Edson wrote a report on this rifle. Edson was the Ordnance officer at the Quartermaster's Depot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The barrel was made nine inches shorter (229\u00a0mm), and there were some other changes as well. The changed BAR weighed 13\u00a0lb. 12\u00a0oz. and was only long. This version was more accurate than the BAR when firing automatically and while lying down, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder. It was also very loud. Though the report written by Edson said that six of the 'jungle' BARs should be built for testing, no more work was done on the project.\nThe M1918A1 had a light bipod with spikes on it, along with some other new features. It was brought into service on 24 June 1937. Not many M1918s were rebuilt to be M1918A1s.\nIn April 1938, work was started on an improved BAR for the U.S. Army. Early prototypes had bipods that were put onto the barrel. It also had a special mechanism to make the rate of fire less. However, in 1939 the Army\nFinal development of the M1918A2 started on 30 June 1938. The M1918A2's buttstock (the part of the gun which sticks out at the back) is about one inch longer than the M1918 BAR buttstock. Late in the war, a handle was put onto the barrel to carry the weapon around.\nBecause the companies did not have a lot of money, the first M1918A2s were just older M1918 BARs that were changed. A small amount M1922s and M1918A1s were also changed. After WWII started, it was tried to make more M1918A2s. However, the World War I tools used to make the M1918 were either worn out or could not be used with modern machines. In 1942, there was not enough wood to make the buttstocks, so a black plastic buttstock was made for the BAR. Firestone Rubber and Latex Products Company made the plastic buttstock for the U.S. Army. This was brought into service on March 21, 1942.\nOther models.\nIn 2008, one company made a modern, semi-automatic version of the Browning Automatic Rifle. This was called the 1918A3 SLR (\"self-loading rifle\").\nCivilian use.\nWhen the war ended, Colt Arms Co. were given the Browning patents to make the BAR that was not given out during the war. This allowed Colt to make the BAR for sale to civilians. This BAR was called the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919. It was first made up of M1918s from the contract with the military which were not delivered. It was one of several Colt BARs. However, the weapon had a high price. It was also not very useful to civilians. Because of this, it did not sell much. Ad Topperwien was a famous shooter of the early 1920s. He bought one of the first Colt BARs to shoot things out of the sky. When the National Firearms Act of 1934 was passed, civilian BARs were restricted. Machine guns for U.S. civilians were banned in 1968. Also, making machine guns for U.S. civilians was banned in 1986.\nCriminal and police use.\nClyde Barrow, a gangster, liked the army's M1918. He got his BARs by robbing the Army National Guard. Barrow taught his girlfriend Bonnie Parker to fire the M1918 as well.\nAutomatic weapons were becoming more popular with gangsters in the United States. Because of this, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover told the FBI to train agents with automatic weapons. Examples were the Thompson submachine gun and the BAR. The FBI bought its BARs from Colt. Colt sold 90 BARs to the agency. Some of the FBI's BARs were sent to FBI offices. They were to be used as support weapons if they were needed. The rest were kept at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. They were there for training. Colt sold another 11 BARs to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. 24 guns were sold to prisons, banks, security companies and police departments.\nIt has sometimes been said that the M1918 or M1918A2 BAR was used by Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) members in a shootout with Los Angeles police. This happened on 17 May 1974. However, no SLA members ever used such a weapon. This confusion happened because Browning decided to call its semi-automatic hunting rifle the Browning BAR. The SLA changed a Browning BAR hunting rifle to automatic fire. It was this weapon that was used in the shootout.\nThe M1918 in U.S. service.\nWorld War I.\nWhen it first came into service, the M1918 was supposed to be fired from the shoulder. It was meant to be a rifle that could give both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. The M1918 was first given out in September 1918.\nAs well as being fired from the shoulder, M1918 gunners were given a belt which had pouches on it for the magazines. They were also given a sidearm.\nThe BAR was not used much during World War I. This was partly because of the Armistice, and also because the U.S. Army did not want the enemy to be able to capture an M1918. 85,000 BARs were built by the war's end.\nIn between World War I and World War II.\nIn between World War I and World War II, the M1918 was given to all U.S. naval landing forces. The weapon could be found on board most U.S. ships. Each BAR had a spare barrel. Big ships often had over 200 BARs on board. Many of the U.S. Navy BARs were still used until the 1960s.\nWorld War II.\nWhen the threat of a new war rose, U.S. Army Ordnance realized they did not have a squad light machine gun that could be moved around easily. They tried to use the M1918 BAR as a light machine gun when the M1918A2 was brought into service with the U.S. Army on 30 June 1938. The BAR was given as the only automatic gun for a squad of eight soldiers. All men were trained how to use the BAR in case the gunner(s) were killed or injured.

Very often, the term is shortened to ER model. ER models are used to create relational databases. They show how the different parts of a data model interact with each other.\nPeter Chen proposed to use this modelling approach in an article he wrote in 1976. Chen was not the first to have this idea. After the publication of the article, the idea was modified as well.\nER modelling.\nIn an ER model, there are three different types of objects:\nSince the database must be able to find an entity or a relationship, it must be able to identify it with a set of attributes that is unique. This set of attributes is usually called \"primary key\".\nAfter all the relations have been mapped, they are usually also revised to include cardinalities; a cardinality specifies the number of entities related in a relationship. This information is needed when the database is created. Depending on cardinality and the level of database normalisation, it may be necessary to introduce additional entities and relationships. \nCreating a database.\nWhen everything has been described, it is easy to create a relational database, as follows:\nLimitations.\nAn ER model describes the relations between entities. It is adapted to represent relational data. Data that cannot easily be put into this form should not be modelled with an ER model. ER is aimed at designing a database from scratch; using it to describe and change a database that already exists may be more difficult to do.\nEven where it is suitable in principle, ER modeling is rarely used as a separate activity.\nOne reason for this is that there are many tools that allow diagramming and that have other design support directly on relational database management systems.\nThese tools can extract database diagrams that are very close to ER diagrams from existing databases, and they provide alternative views on the information contained in such diagrams.\nIn a survey, Brodie and Liu could not find a single instance of entity-relationship modeling inside a sample of ten Fortune 100 companies. Badia and Lemire blame this lack of use on the lack of guidance but also on the lack of benefits, such as lack of support for data integration."}

He is a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 1996. \nThe proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\nIn the summer of 1986, Wiles decided to prove the theorem. Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet had done successful research in the last few years. Wiles realised that he could prove a limited form of the modularity theorem. So, he decided to solve this problem. This was done somewhat secretly. In 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. In August 1993, however, it turned out that the proof contained a gap. Wiles tried to fill in this gap. But the error he made was a very basic one. Wiles got the crucial idea for avoiding, rather than closing this gap. This came to him on 19 September 1994. Together with his former student Richard Taylor, he published a second paper. This avoided the error and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the \"Annals of Mathematics\".\nRecognition by the media.\nWiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was scrutinized by mathematical experts.

This means that all solutions of the second equation must also be solutions of the first one and vice versa. The equation formula_1 is equivalent with formula_4. So the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials.\nIf an algebraic equation is over the rationals, it can always be converted to an equivalent one, where all the coefficients are integers. For example, in the equation given above, we multiply by 42 = 2\u00b73\u00b77 and group the terms in the first member. The equation is converted to\nThe solutions of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true. But for algebraic equations there are also called roots. When solving an equation, we need to say in which set the solutions are allowed. For example, for an equation over the rationals, one can find solutions in the integers. Then, the equation is a diophantine equation. One may also look for solutions in the field of complex numbers. One can also look for solutions in real numbers.\nAncient mathematicians wanted the solutions of univariate equations (that is, equations with one variable) in the form of radical expressions, like formula_6 for the positive solution of formula_7. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 (that is equations in which the highest power of the variable is 2) in this manner. During the Renaissance, Gerolamo Cardano solved the equation of degree 3 and Lodovico Ferrari solved the equation of degree 4. Finally Niels Henrik Abel proved in 1824 that the equation of degree 5 and the equations of higher degree cannot always be solved by using radicals. Galois theory, named after \u00c9variste Galois, were introduced to give criteria deciding if an equation is solvable using radicals."}

He cuts off Rick's right hand and rapes Michonne many times. The Governor lets the three escape. He hopes they can be followed back to where they came from. Before leaving, Michonne attacks the Governor. She tortures him and causes much damage to his body.\nThe group at the prison get ready for an attack by the people from Woodbury. As time passes and there is no attack for weeks, they start to feel safe. Lori, Rick\u2019s wife, gives birth. Glenn marries his girlfriend Maggie. The two of them \u201cadopt\u201d Sophia, a girl in the group whose mother died. Rick and Hershel are out in the yard looking at their vegetable garden when the Governor and a small army comes to the prison fence.\nThe group from Woodbury have better weapons and more people but Rick's group kills many of them and they move back away from the prison. Glenn and Maggie think they will attack again. They take Sophia and leave the prison with another family. Michonne and Tyreese are caught while trying to attack Woodbury. Michonne escapes but the Governor kills Tyreese outside the prison gate. He then begins a second attack on the prison.\nThe Governor\u2019s forces use a tank to break down the fence. Many people in Rick's group are killed in the fighting. These include Hershel, Lori and the baby. Rick and Carl escape from the battle. Zombies move in through the broken fence. They begin to attack the Woodbury forces. One of the Woodbury soldiers shoots the Governor in the head. The people of Woodbury fight on, but there are too many zombies.\nRick and Carl find Michonne and those who left the prison earlier. They soon find three people who are traveling to Washington, D.C. One of them, Eugene, says he is a government scientist. He tells them he is in radio contact with survivors in the capital.\nMaggie tries to kill herself after the death of her family. Rick and Abraham go out looking for supplies. Abraham is a U.S. Army sergeant who is traveling with Eugene. The two become friends when they tell each other about the killings they have had to do to survive.\nThe group\u2019s oldest member, Dale, is bitten by a zombie. He leaves the group in the dark to go into the forest so he can die alone. He is captured by a group of cannibals. They eat his leg before he dies. Rick and the other adults find and kill the cannibals. A reverend is the only person among them who think they way they killed the cannibals was bad.\nWhen they get near Washington, Eugene tells the group that he was actually a high school science teacher and has no contact with the government. Washington is full of zombies like other cities. A man comes to the group and tells them about a peaceful walled-off town of about 40 people. It is called the Alexandria Safe Zone. He takes them to this town.\nRick is worried that the Alexandrians have forgotten how dangerous the world is. He slowly starts to not follow their rules. As town constable, he secretly carries a gun and disobeys Alexandria's leader, Douglas, to stop a domestic dispute. After the newcomers help stop an attack on Alexandria by other survivors, Douglas sees that Rick is a better leader and steps down.\nThe gunfire during the attack causes a herd of zombies to move toward the town. They break through Alexandria\u2019s wall and begin to kill people. The people hide in their houses while zombies fill the town. Rick, Carl and Alexandria resident Jessie try to escape the town. Jessie is killed by the walkers.\nWhen Rick and Carl are surrounded by zombies, Douglas tries to help them. He accidentally shoots Carl in the eye before being killed. Rick carries Carl to Alexandria\u2019s surgeon. He then goes back outside. Rick, Michonne and other residents destroy the entire herd. This shows Rick that zombies can be dealt with. He decides to rebuild civilization at Alexandria.\nCarl wakes from a coma but he does not remember everything that has happened over the past few years.\nRick stops a small rebellion in Alexandria but forgives the rebels.\nAndrea tells Rick that she loves him. He does not love her back.\nA man named Paul soon comes to the town. He says he is from a nearby community of about 200 people. Paul wants to trade supplies with Alexandria. He tells them that he already does so with several other survivor groups in the area. Rick thinks this may be a trap and captures Paul. He gets Alexandria ready to defend against an attack. Rick soon changes his mind and decides to trade with Paul's group. He tells Andrea that Carl is in the house and asks her to watch him while he is gone. Rick then leaves with Paul and several other to go to Paul's group.\nReception.\nThe series is very well liked by critics. It won the Eisner Award for \"Best Continuing Series\" in 2010. Eric Sunde of IGN comics called it \"one of the best monthly comics available\". Max Brooks told Kirkman that he read \"The Walking Dead\" and liked it.\nIGN ranked Rick Grimes as the 26th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time in 2011.

It is the national sport of Argentina.\n\"\" is Spanish for \"duck\". The early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. Pato has been written about since 1610. The playing field would often go between neighboring ranches. The first team to reach its own ranch house with the duck was the winner.\nPato was banned several times during its history. This was due to the violence\u2014not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot. Some lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest said that pato players who died this way should not get Christian burial. Laws saying people could not play pato were common in the 19th century.\nDuring the 1930s, pato had rules added by ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse. He made a set of rules based on modern polo. President Juan Per\u00f3n made pato Argentina's national game in 1953.\nGameplay.\nIn modern pato, two four-member teams ride on horses. They try to get a ball which has six handles. They score by throwing the ball through a ring that is vertical. The rings have a 100\u00a0cm (3.3\u00a0ft) diameter. They are on 240\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0ft) high poles. A closed net, going up for 140\u00a0cm (4.6\u00a0ft), holds the ball after goals are scored.\nThe winner is the team with most goals scored after the time is done. Game time is six 8-minute \"periods\".\nThe field is: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40\u00a0cm (15.7\u00a0in) handle-to-handle. The weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8\u00a0lbs).\nThe player that has control of the ' (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched. He offers the pato so rival players have a chance of tugging the pato and stealing it. Not holding his arm out while riding with the pato is an offense called ' (refusal).\nDuring the tug itself, or \"\", both players must stand on the stirrups and not sit on the saddle. The hand not tugging must hold the reins. The tug is usually the most exciting part of the game.\nPato is similar to the game of horseball played in France, Portugal, and other countries."}

It is named after Plymouth, Devon, England. This district includes New Plymouth City and a few smaller towns. The district has 1.7 percent of the country's people.\nNew Plymouth Airport is the 11th busiest airport in New Zealand, with regular flights to Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch.\nHistory.\nIn 1828, Richard Barrett set up a trading post at Ngamotu after he arrived on the ship \"Adventure\". Barrett dealt with the local M\u0101ori and bought land from them.\nThe British tried to occupy the area during the early 1840s. But when they arrived, they found an area with few M\u0101ori - remaining survivors of a number of inter-tribal wars. At first, land was easily bought but then as time went on, it became more difficult and Europeans wanted more and more of Maori farmland, as Maoris were returning to the area and did not want to sell the land. War finally started in 1860 and lasted for nearly 10 years, resulting in land confiscations by the British government.\nGeography.\nThe area is known for its dairy farms and its location. It is very close to both sea and mountain, with Mount Taranaki just south of the city. The volcanic cone of Mt Taranaki gives a view of the coastline. Taranaki, which is 2518 metres high, is one of the most climbed mountains in New Zealand. It is one of the places in New Zealand that attracts the most rainfall and the mountain has created a unique environment perfect for plants, alpine herb fields, and native and tropical forest. This attracts many bird species that can be observed in the National Park and surrounding areas."}

The result was the removal of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and the forming of a local government now called the \"Primera Junta\". In Argentina this is now celebrated as \"May Week\" ().\nThe May Revolution was a direct reaction to Spain's Peninsular War of the previous two years. In 1808, King Ferdinand\u00a0VII of Spain abdicated in favor of Napoleon. Napoleon gave the throne to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte. \nThe May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence.
