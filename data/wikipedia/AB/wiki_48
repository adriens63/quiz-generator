Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a constitutional monarchy. Until the 20th century, all Ireland had a constitutional monarchy and was a part of the United Kingdom since 1801. Monarchies were in existence through most of the history of Ireland.\nIn the High Middle Ages, the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland ended when the Normans invaded Ireland. Ireland became a fief of the Papal States (the government of the Pope). The King of England's government started to control many of the lands of Ireland. This continued until the English Reformation, when the Kingdom of England got full ownership of Ireland. The Kingdom of Ireland came into existence in the reign of Henry VIII. Henry VIII was the first to be both King of England and King of Ireland.\nThe Kingdom of Ireland started in 1542. Before 1603, Ireland shared a monarch with the Kingdom of England (but not with the Kingdom of Scotland) in a personal union. When Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth I died in 1603, James VI and I became the first to be King of Ireland, King of England, and King of Scotland in a three-kingdom personal union. Between 1603 and 1707, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. Anne was the Queen of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence in 1707. Anne was Queen of Ireland and Queen of Great Britain. Between 1707 and 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the British monarchy with the United Kingdom of Great Britain. (During the government of Oliver Cromwell, the British Isles became a republic: the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.) George III was King of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into existence at the start of 1801. George III was the first to be king of the new kingdom, which combined the whole British Isles (except the Isle of Man) into one kingdom for the first time.\nIn December 1922, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become part of the Irish Free State, a dominion within the British Empire; the rest, Northern Ireland, remained within the United Kingdom. In 1937, after George V died, the Free State changed its laws to give the British monarchs much less power. In April 1949, the Republic of Ireland stopped having a monarchy entirely, and left the Commonwealth of Nations. Since then, the only part of Ireland to have a monarchy is Northern Ireland (because it is part of the United Kingdom). Elizabeth II is the present queen. Charles, Prince of Wales is the heir apparent."}

Texas, 539 US 558 (2003), is the primary piece of case law which ultimately decriminalized sodomy in the United States. Ruled upon by the United States Supreme Court in 2003, \"Lawrence v. Texas\" concerned a Texas law that criminalized consensual, adult homosexual intercourse which was found unconstitutional under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nBackground of the case.\nHouston Police were tipped off to a weapons disturbance purportedly from the residence of John Lawrence. Upon entering the apartment, police found Lawrence and Tyron Garner engaging in sexual intercourse. At the time, a statute was in place which banned such homosexual sex acts and further deemed homosexuality a \"deviance.\" Both Lawrence and Garner were arrested and convicted under this statute.\nUpon appeal, the Texas State Court of Appeals affirmed the men's convictions citing \"Bowers v. Hardwick\", 478 US 186 (1986), as the controlling case.\nLawrence filed for certiorari to the Supreme Court which was granted in 2003.\nRuling.\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court voted to overturn Lawrence's conviction and declared the Texas anti-sodomy statute unconstitutional. The decision hinged on the right of Lawrence and Garner to engage in private conduct under the Due Process Clause. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing the majority opinion, stated \"[Lawrence and Garner's] right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.\" The decision to overturn \"Bowers v. Hardwick\" was 5-4, with Justice O'Connor (a member of the \"Bowers\" majority back in 1986) refusing to overturn \"Bowers\" and instead supporting the \"Lawrence\" ruling on narrower Equal Protection grounds because the challenged Texas law made male-male sodomy illegal but not male-female sodomy.\nCriticism.\nIn a 2004 law review article, U.S. law professors Nelson Lund and John McGinnis criticized \"Lawrence v. Texas\" due to its alleged judicial hubris and expressed fears that its extremely broad language could have unexpected consequences in the long(er)-run.\nRelated pages.\nUnited States Obscenity Law\nFurther reading.\nCarpenter, Dale.

Her scar is heavily toned down, and she is aged to her twenties. Hilmar described her character as challenging to play. Christian Rivers, the director of the film, addressed the fan criticism over Hester's scar, stating that audiences would be \"put off the film\" if it were more true to the books. The author acknowledged the difference. Other changes include: she lost her mother when she was eight and she fought Valentine aboard his airship."}

It is also called Mafia. The game is usually between two teams. There is an evil team that less players belong to. This group knows who is good and who is evil. They have to hide that they are evil from the good team. There is the good team, called the village, that has most of the players. People in this team have to find out who is good and bad. Everyone is given their role at the beginning of the game by a person who is not playing, called a moderator. The game has two stages, day and night. At night, everyone closes their eyes. The moderator tells the evil team to open their eyes. They choose someone to kill or remove from the game. Some other roles on both teams can do things at night. In the day, everyone opens their eyes. The players that are still alive will talk to each other about everyone's roles. They also each choose someone to kill, and the person that the most people choose will be killed. The game keeps going until only the members from one team are left.\nHistory.\nDmitry Davidoff (, \"Dmitry Davydov\") is usually said to have made the game. He says he first made the game in Spring 1987 at the Psychology department of Moscow State University. He made it to do psychology research and his job of teaching high school students. It got popular in other Soviet colleges and school in the 1990s. It also started to be played in some parts of Europe and the United States.\nAndrew Plotkin made a werewolf theme for the mafia rules in 1997. He said that mafia was not that big of a cultural reference. He also said that werewolves made sense in the rules. Werewolves are bad creatures that hide in the day. Many science fiction writer groups and people at tech events started playing mafia.\nA person with the username \"mithrandir\" ran a game of werewolf on the website The Grey Labyrinth's forum in August 2000. The Grey Labyrinth is a website about solving puzzles. The website says that this was the first werewolf game that was played on a forum.\nSome parents in Rockingham complained to a school there. They were scared of bad effects that the game could have on their kids. Davidoff said that the game could \"teach kids to distinguish right from wrong.\" He also said that the good lesson of being honest was stronger than the scariness of the game.\nAbout.com said that Werewolf one of the 50 most important games since 1890.\nPlaying.\nSimpler games have players put into two teams. This is the evil team and the good team. The evil team is called the werewolves. The good team is called the village. Games will need someone who is not playing. This person is called the moderator. Everyone will get a card before the game starts. This card will give them a role. Each role is part of a team. The role might also have powers. These powers can do many things. An example is finding out a player's team.\nThe game has two stages. These are night and day. At night the werewolves open their eyes. They silently choose who to kill. At day all players vote on someone to lynch. The village also finds out who was killed at night."}

They live in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThey have large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet. Nuthatches advertise their territory with loud, simple songs. Most species have grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.\nThey live in forests, often pine coniferous forests, on higher land (montane forests). As usual in such places, insects, nuts and seeds are their food.\nNuthatches use holes in trees for nests. This means they compete with squirrels and woodpeckers for these holes. In fact both squirrels and the great spotted woodpecker kill nuthatches if they can. Owls and hawks also kill these small birds, but that is not to do with their nest-holes. In defence of their nests, nuthatches make the entrances smaller by packing the edges with mud or tree resin. Predation is not really a threat, just a fact of life for them. Loss of coniferous forest in some countries is a threat. They cannot live except in trees.\nAll nuthatches store food, especially seeds. They hide seeds in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes. These stores are remembered for as long as 30 days."}

{"id": "731461", "revid": "1121896", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=731461", "title": "Philo of Alexandria", "text": "Philo Judaeus, also known as Philo of Alexandria, was a Jewish philosopher who lived from c. 20 BC to c. 50 AD. Philo wanted to prove that the Torah and Greek philosophy actually agreed with each other and he used allegory to do that. In 38 AD, Philo was one of many Egyptian Jews to meet with the Roman Emperor Caligula and he wrote a book about it.\nLife.\nEither Philo\u2019s father or his father\u2019s father was a Jew who became a Roman citizen based on a decision of the dictator Julius Caesar. Philo went to the Second Temple of Jerusalem at least once. Philo lived at the same time as Jesus did.\nEmbassy to Gaius.\nWhen Philo was living in Alexandria the Jews were treated badly by the Greeks. According to Philo\u2019s book Against Flaccus, Egypt\u2019s Roman ruler Aulis Avilius Flaccus persecuted the Jews because the Jews refused to worship Caligula as a god. Philo wrote his book Against Flaccus attacking him for doing that. Philo was one of many Jews who went to Rome to convince Caligula not to build a giant statue of himself as the god Jupiter and put it inside the Second Temple of Jerusalem because if Caligula did that the Jews would rebel against him. Philo wrote a book describing his mission to Caligula called Legatio ad Gaium (The Embassy to Gaius) because Gaius was Caligula\u2019s real name.\nJosephus\u2019s Version.\nAccording to the Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus, born Yosef ben Matityahu, in his book The Antiquities of the Jews, Philo was the brother of the Roman-appointed Jewish tax collector Alexander. In Josephus\u2019s version, the Jews refused to worship Caligula even though he commanded them to and Philo believed the Jews were right and that to worship Caligula would be a sin against God. A Roman named Apion came to Alexandria to convince the Jews that they were traitors to the Emperor and that Caligula would punish them but Philo convinced them that \u201c they should be of good courage, since Gaius\u2019s words indeed showed anger at them but in reality had already set God against himself\u201d. According to Josephus, the Jews of Alexandria chose Philo to represent them to Caligula and Philo said yes because he wanted to end the violence of the Greeks against the Jews.\nPhilo\u2019s Books.\nQuaestiones(Latin for the Inquiries) is a series of books by Philo explaining the Torah, verse by verse with the first four books being about Genesis and the last two about Exodus.\nAllegorical Commentary- a book by Philo about hidden meaning in the Book of Genesis.\nExposition of the Law, a classification of all the general topics in the Torah written for both Jews and Gentiles.\nOn the Life of Moses, a biography of Moses meant to show Moses as a philosopher.\nOn the Jews, a defence of the religion of Judaism.\nOn the Contemplative Life, a book by Philo arguing that [\nnot only does Greek philosophy not disagree with Judaism it was created by Judaism.\nAgainst Flaccus, a book by Philo attacking Flaccus for his persecution of Egyptian Jews.\nThe Embassy to Gaius, an eyewitness account of the mission to Caligula.\nEvery Good Man is Free, about moral philosophy.\nOn the Eternity of the World, about Metaphysics.\nOn Animals, about Animals\nOn Providence, about God.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilo tries to prove that the teachings of Plato and of Moses actually work well together. He also thinks to be a good person, you have to control your emotions.\nThe Bible.\nPhilo believed that all truth was in the Hebrew Bible and that everything in the Torah came from God. Philo believed that all philosophy comes from the Torah and even Greek philosophers got their ideas from there. Philo also said that every person in the Hebrew Bible actually represented a human quality. Adam represents mind, Eve represents the senses and Noah represents (\u201ctranquility\u201d) .\nPhilo believed that God does not have a body or emotions. Philo says that no one really knows anything for sure except that God exists. Based on Plato, Philo argued that everything that exists has always existed as an idea in the mind of God. \nPolitics.\nBecause of his mission to Caligula people know that Philo was involved in politics but not what his political beliefs actually were. Philo did write that someone who told a tyrant what he really thought about him put not only his own life in danger but also the lives of his wife and children and that one should therefore not do that except if doing that were likely to work.\nInfluence.\nFor years, Philo was an influence on Christians like Eusebius and Jerome but was ignored by Jewish scholars. Then in 1575, an Italian Rabbi named Azariah die Rossi wrote a book in which he criticized Philo for reading the Torah in Greek instead of Hebrew, for believing that God created the Universe from matter that had always existed instead of believing that He created the Universe out of nothing, for relying too much on allegory in his approach to the Hebrew Bible and for not consulting\nJewish tradition. Rossi then tries to defend Philo and decides that he can\u2019t be sure if Philo\u2019s work is compatible with Judaism or not."}

Three fingers are used when signing the cross in Orthodoxy, to represent the three parts of the Trinity. In history, Serbs used the three-finger salute when they were making oaths. Often, the salute was done with both hands above the head.

It has a unique look and good hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically native to the state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.\nNobody knows for sure how the Maine Coon got to the United States, so there are several different ideas. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but it almost became extinct because of long-haired breeds from overseas in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since been brought back and is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the USA.\nThe Maine Coon is a large and friendly cat, which is how it got its nickname, \"the gentle giant.\" It is characterized by a big ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat, and a long, bushy tail. The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. People often say the Maine Coon has \"dog-like\" characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems recurring in the breed, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems."}

The House passed two articles of impeachment which charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. If Trump had been found guilty, he would have been removed from the presidency. On February 5, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump (decide that he was not guilty), for both charges.\nJanuary 2020.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi refused to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate after the House approved it. Senator Lindsey Graham proposed that he and Senator Mitch McConnell \"change the rules of the Senate so we could start the trial without [Pelosi], if necessary\".\nOn January 9, 2020, Pelosi said she would deliver the articles soon, but continued to cite a need for Republican transparency in the Senate; the same day, McConnell informed members of his caucus that he expected the trial to begin next week, and Senator Josh Hawley announced that McConnell had signed on as a co-sponsor to his resolution to dismiss articles of impeachment not sent to the Senate within 25 days. \nOn January 10, Pelosi announced that she had \"asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate\".\nAt the end of the January 21 session, the Senate voted along party lines to pass Mitch McConnell's proposed trial rules and reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats. The prosecution's opening arguments and presentation of evidence took place between January 22\u201324. Trump's defense presentation began on January 25. The primary arguments were a lack of direct evidence of wrongdoing, and that Democrats were attempting to use the impeachment to steal the 2020 election. Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict the president.\nOfficers of the trial.\nThe presiding judge.\nThe only mention of the chief justice in the entire constitution is that he is the presiding officer in the impeachment trial of the president. Under senate rules adopted in 1998, he also exercises this function in the trial of a vice president.\nAttorneys for the defense.\nThe White House has formally announced its Senate trial counsel as being led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, alongside Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Pam Bondi, Jane Raskin, Eric Herschmann, and Robert Ray. Additionally, Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin will participate in the trial.\nOn January 20, the White House named eight House Republicans to serve on Trump's defense team: Doug Collins, Mike Johnson, Jim Jordan, Debbie Lesko, Mark Meadows, John Ratcliffe, Elise Stefanik, and Lee Zeldin.\nWitness hearings.\nThere were many witnesses who wished to testify before the Senate. The Senate voted on whether or not to allow witnesses to testify. Fifty-one votes were required to allow witnesses. There were 47 Democrats* and 53 Republicans in the Senate. All the Democrats* voted to allow witnesses to testify. Of the Republicans, Mitt Romney from Utah and Susan Collins of Maine voted to allow witnesses. This did not meet the required number of votes, and so no witnesses were allowed to testify.\nSenate verdict.\nOn February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both charges. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count. All Democrats, both independents, and only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to convict. The remaining Republicans all voted to acquit."}

The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama \"Casualty\". It was first shown on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as \"Casualty\" in the fictional city of Holby. Some episodes have characters and plots shared with \"Casualty\". There have been episodes broadcast as \"Casualty@Holby City\". Some episodes have characters and plots shared with the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off \"HolbyBlue\".\n\"Holby City\" is shown once a week, all year round. Each series now contains 52 episodes.\nThe show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital.\nAs of January 2020, twenty-one series of \"Holby City\" have been shown. It is made at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire. It has featured episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, \"Holby City\" moved to high definition broadcasting.\nThe series uses a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy. Surgeons check the scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures. They spend time on hospital wards for research. \n\"Holby City\" has been nominated for over 100 television awards. It has won ten awards. The 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Continuing Drama, one Black Entertainment Film Fashion Television and Arts (BEFFTA) award, two Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards, two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four Screen Nation awards. \nThe first series averaged 9.27\u00a0million viewers. The eleventh series averaged 5.44\u00a0million viewers. Later series have had over 4 million viewers per week.\nProduction.\nThe first series had eleven main characters. All have since left the show. New main characters have been written in and out of the series. There are fifteen main characters. Well known actors regularly appear. Cast members have included Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Ade Edmondson, John Michie, Al Hunter Ashton, Alex Walkinshaw and Jemma Redgrave.\nIn September 2016 the BBC said the show would be put up for tender. \nThe tender document said the contract would be open to independent producers and BBC Studios. It would be for three series of at least 50 episodes each. It would be delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission. It would be produced at BBC Elstree Centre. \nBBC Studios was the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show to 2020.\nDevelopment.\n\"Holby City\" was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama \"Casualty\". It is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital. \nYoung wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in \"Casualty\" once they were taken to the hospital's surgical wards. \nThe stories on \"Casualty\" are limited to the \"accident of the week\". \"Holby City\" has stories about long-term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions. \nThe series was commissioned by BBC One Controller Peter Salmon. It was first shown on BBC One on 12 January 1999.\nSince its beginning, it has expanded to cover other wards. These include a gynaecology ward, an acute assessment unit and a maternity ward. \nYoung explained that new wards are necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets.\nEpisodes of \"Holby City\" cost around \u00a3370,000 to produce. This is more than the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" which costs \u00a3130,000 per episode. \"Casualty\" costs \u00a3450,000 per episode. As \"Holby City\" is a high-volume, year-round production, it has relatively low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years. Sets can be re-used. This is not the case for shorter series or one-off dramas.\nFormer \"Casualty\" producer Johnathan Young was an executive producer of \"Holby\" first series. \nMal Young was executive producer of \"Holby City\" until 2004. \nKathleen Hutchison worked with Mal Young as co-executive producer from 2003 to 2004. She left the series to become executive producer of \"EastEnders\". \nIn March 2011, Johnathan Young returned to the BBC as executive producer of both \"Casualty\" and \"Holby City\".\nWriting.\n\"Holby City\" storylines are planned eight months in advance. The series has a number of scriptwriters. They are found and scheduled by script development editor Simon Harper. \nHarper finds some writers through the BBC Writers Academy. This is a course which gives its graduates the chance to work on prime time television. McHale teaches at the academy, and graduate Abi Bown went on to become a regular writer for \"Holby City\". \nHarper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme. \nMcHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. \nHis 2006 promotion to executive producer was part Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke's plan to \"put writers back at the heart of the process\". Yorke said McHale's promotion was \"fantastic. It means that for the first time you've got a writer running one of our big powerhouse BBC1 shows.\" \nAfter McHale resigned the lead writer was Justin Young. He wants a more writer-led process from series 13 onwards. Writers will create more of the story of their episodes than before.\nMedical accuracy.\nThe serial employs a team of researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo appearance in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon. Another advisor, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in \"Holby City\" as a scrub nurse. \nThe programme uses different types os surgeons to check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is important as viewers might copy what they see in the show, such as CPR. \nActor Amanda Mealing said: \"We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones.\" \nCast members are taught how to give injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some watch procedures in hospitals. \nOriginal cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer. Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.\nFilming and on-screen output.\n\"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" are both set in Holby City Hospital. This is in the fictional county of Wyvern in the southwest of England close to the Welsh border. \nBristol is used for city exteriors. Interior filming of \"Holby City\" is at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.\nThe \"Casualty\" set in Bristol was not large enough for the surgical ward and operating theatre needed for \"Holby City\". So some scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the \"Casualty\" set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. \nIn October 2007, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the Elstree site would be sold, and \"Holby City\" moved to share a set with \"Casualty\", possibly in Cardiff. \nIn March 2009, the BBC said that \"Casualty\" would move to a new set in Cardiff. In April 2009, \"The Guardian\" said that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios for at least another four years.\nSome episodes have been shot on location abroad. In 2004, the romance between nurse Jess Griffin (Verona Joseph) and anaesthetist Zubin Khan (Art Malik) had an episode set in Paris. \nIn 2005, registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) followed consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) to Ghana. This was part of the BBC's \"Africa lives\" series, a week of programmes bringing African culture to UK audiences. \nIn 2006, an episode in Switzerland had consultant Elliot Hope's (Paul Bradley) wife Gina (Gillian Bevan) committing assisted suicide after her motor neurone disease worsened. \nA 2007 episode in Dubai focused on \"Holby\" registrar Joseph Byrne (Luke Roberts) meeting new nurse Faye Morton (Patsy Kensit).\nIn 2008, Joseph and consultant Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow) travelled to Cape Town. \nIn November 2008, series producer Diana Kyle said that they would not be filming abroad again for the \"foreseeable future\". \nOn 10 December 2012, it was announced that the show had filmed one episode in Stockholm. This focussed on Jac tracking down hospital CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry).\n\"Holby City\" is shot using the single-camera setup. \nFilming occurs from 8\u00a0am until 6\u00a0pm daily, 50 weeks a year. \nFrom July 2007 onwards, the show took on the filmising technique, giving the impression of having been shot on film. \nOn 28 May 2010, the BBC announced that \"Holby City\" would move to HD by the end of the year. \nThe series moved to HD broadcasting, with a BBC HD simulcast, from the start of series 13 in October 2010.\nMusic.\nFrom the eleventh series a musical montage segment was included in each episode. This was introduced by McHale to modernise the show. This use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\". McHale stated he was unaware of this until after \"Holby City\" had used the technique. \nMusic is selected by each episode's scriptwriter. Sometimes the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors have had some input: Hugh Quarshie selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle said: \"they are an excellent way of telling stories visually\".\nBroadcast.\n\"Holby City\" was first shown on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. \nThe show's first series ran for nine episodes. \nIn June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of \"Holby City\". \nThe second series ran for 16 episodes.\nThe third series ran for 30 episodes.\nEpisodes were shown weekly from the fourth series onwards. \nSeries four to nine ran for 52 episodes. Series ten ran for 53 episodes, including the stand-alone finale episode \"Mad World\", set outside the hospital. Series eleven ran for 52 episodes. Series twelve had 55 episodes.\nAll series from then on had 52 episodes. The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.\nIn the first series episodes were 50 minutes long. From the second series episodes have been one hour. \nThe first series was shown on Tuesday nights at 8.10\u00a0pm. The second series moved to Thursdays. Halfway through the third series in 2001, Holby moved back to Tuesday night at 8.05\u00a0pm. It then moved into the 8pm timeslot, where it has remained. The show is occasionally shown on a different day. \nIn 2007, the show moved to Thursday nights to allow HolbyBlue to be shown in the 8pm Tuesday timeslot. BBC One Scotland has often shown the series at a later time.\nIn February 2019, it was announced that repeats of \"Holby City\" would begin on the channel Drama. This would begin with the first series.\nIn Finland it is shown on the channel Yle TV2 and is called \"Holby Cityn sairaala\".\nSeries twenty-two started on 7 January 2020.\nCharacters and cast.\nCharacters.\n\"Holby City\" follows the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at Holby General. It has an ensemble cast of main and recurring characters. The show has 10 to 20 main characters.\nThe original cast of 11 characters featured in the show's first episode was consultants Anton Meyer (George Irving) and Muriel McKendrick (Phyllis Logan), registrars Nick Jordan (Michael French) and Kirstie Collins (Dawn McDaniel), senior house officer Victoria Merrick (Lisa Faulkner), ward sister Karen Newburn (Sarah Preston), theatre sister Ellie Sharpe (Julie Saunders), senior staff nurse Ray Sykes (Ian Curtis), staff nurses Julie Bradford (Nicola Stephenson) and Jasmine Hopkins (Angela Griffin), and ward clerk Paul Ripley (Luke Mably).\nCasting.\nFor the first series, Young selected actors who were already established and had a soap opera background. Young had previously worked on the soap operas \"Brookside\" and \"Family Affairs\" \nFrench had starred in the BBC's \"EastEnders\", while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in \"Brookside\". Griffin had also appeared in ITV's \"Coronation Street\". Hiring of established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former \"Brookside\" actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, \"Star Wars\" actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and \"Family Affairs\" star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later, roles were given to comedian Adrian Edmondson, film actress Patsy Kensit, and \"Jesus of Nazareth\" star Powell. \nThere is a casting department at Elstree Studios which casts actors for \"Holby City\" as well as \"Casualty\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Doctors\". The programme also has two casting directors who bring in actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in minor \"Holby City\" roles. \nCurrent characters include acting chief executive officer and consultant neurosurgeon Max McGerry (Jo Martin), consultant general surgeon and medical director Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), consultant cardiothoracic surgeons lead Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) and Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo), consultant general surgeons Ben Sherwood (Charlie Condou), Ange Godard (Dawn Steele), Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett), and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell), speciality registrars Dominic Copeland (David Ames), Xavier Duval (Marcus Griffiths), and Chloe Godard (Amy Lennox), foundation training doctors Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) and Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman), director of nursing Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw), and senior staff nurses Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg).\nGuest stars.\n\"Holby City\" has had a number of famous guest stars.\nIn the first few series:\nIn the fiftieth episode\nOther notable guest stars include\nWalk-on roles.\nIn 2003, the BBC reached an agreement with the actors' union Equity to cease offering walk-on drama series roles to members of the public as prizes. When an untrained person won such a role in \"Holby City\" in a competition, Equity complained to the broadcaster that such prizes were \"demeaning\" to actors, depriving them of paid employment. The competition winner was allowed to visit the \"Holby City\" set, but did not appear on-screen as a result of the policy change.\nAdaptations and other appearances.\n\"Casualty@Holby City\".\nThe BBC has shown occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled \"Casualty@Holby City\". It has a number of characters from each of the two casts. \nBefore \"Casualty@Holby City\", the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before. For example developing a romance between \"Holby City\" Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and \"Casualty\" Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). \nThe first full crossover was made by \"Casualty\" executive producer Mervyn Watson, and \"Holby City\" McHale. Work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release cast members to appear in the special.\nA second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season. This aimed to raise public awareness of organ donation and to decide to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of \"Casualty@Holby City\" was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. \nThe third \"Casualty@Holby City\" crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A&amp;E demonstration at an inner-city school. \nAnother crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.\nIn February 2010, another crossover occurred when \"Casualty\" Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) was operated on by \"Holby City\" Elliot Hope after suffering a heart attack. The storyline was shown as \"Casualty\" and \"Holby City\" episodes, rather than under the \"Casualty@Holby City\" title. \n\"Casualty\" series producer Oliver Kent commented that, while it is \"fantastic\" to be able to produce crossover episodes, they are logistically difficult, and it is unlikely that another \"Casualty@Holby City\" episode will be produced in the \"foreseeable future\". \nIn September 2010, \"Holby City\" nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) appeared in \"Casualty\", and Kent hopes that characters from the two shows will begin to crossover two or three times a year.\nHolbyBlue.\nOn 27 April 2006, the BBC announced \"Holby Blue\", a police procedural spin-off from \"Holby City\". It was created by Tony Jordan.\n\"Holby City\" was moved to Thursdays for the duration of \"HolbyBlue\" first series, with the spin-off broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8\u00a0pm. \nIn 2008, a two-part crossover episode with \"Holby City\" was developed for the beginning of the show's second series. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan. \"Holby City\" registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder. \nYorke compared the crossover to the American \"CSI\" franchise, in that: \"You really believe it's a world.\"\nThe second series attracted 5.6\u00a0million viewers to its opening episode. By the end of May 2008 viewer numbers had fallen to 2.5\u00a0million. \nIn August 2008, the BBC announced that, due to lower ratings, \"Holby Blue\" would not be recommissioned for a third series.\nOther appearances.\nIn June 2002, cast members from \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" competed against the \"EastEnders\" cast for the first \"Sport Relief\" fundraiser, dubbed \"Sport in the Square\". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. \nThe competition was shown on BBC One, and the event raised \u00a310\u00a0million. \nIn October 2003, BBC One aired a \"Kenyon Confronts\" documentary by \"Panorama\" reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the \"Holby City\" cast in specially written scenes. \nIn March 2004, the documentary \"Making It at Holby\" was made as part of a BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\", from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes.\nIn November 2006, the \"Children in Need\" charity telethon included a segment featuring the \"Holby City\" cast performing a comical version of \"Hung Up\" by Madonna. \nIn November 2007 \"Children in Need\" appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, \"Respect\".\nOn 28 June 2008, \"Holby City\" stars competed against their \"Casualty\" counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show \"The Weakest Link\". \nIn February 2010, \"Holby City\" and \"Casualty\" cast members performed a dance rendition of \"Jai Ho\" for \"Let's Dance for Sport Relief\".\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Holby City\" has been compared to other medical dramas, often unfavourable. \nIn November 2002, John Whiston, then head of drama at Granada Television, accused the BBC of producing inferior \"parodies\" of ITV drama. He commented \"With \"Holby City\" cloned out of \"Casualty\", the BBC has even ended up copying itself.\" \nPaul Hoggart of \"The Times\" says that the differences between the two shows are \"mild\", calling \"Holby City\": \"\"Casualty\" cute little sister\". \nKevin Lygo, director of television at Channel 4, referred to \"Holby City\" as \"sudsy drama\", deeming it, \"Casualty\" and \"HolbyBlue\" \"all decent programmes, but strikingly similar in many aspects of their tone and construction.\" \n\"Holby City\" has been unfavourably compared with the American medical drama \"ER\". Television producer Paul Abbott has commented that although he watches \"ER\", he does not watch \"Holby City\" as: \"it looks like you've crammed one hour's drama into 26 episodes.\" \nIn October 2009, former \"Holby City\" writer Peter Jukes wrote a critical piece for \"Prospect\" magazine, contrasting the show negatively with the standard of American television dramas. Jukes wrote that \"Holby City\" has become a soap opera, rather than a drama, and deemed the episodes he worked on \"the most dispiriting experiences in [his] 25 years as a dramatist.\"\nIn August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being \"humdrum\" and \"formulaic\", saying of \"Holby City\" and the police procedural \"Mersey Beat\": \"One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different.\" Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were \"highly selective\" as well as \"hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like \"Holby City\" \u2013 week in, week out\". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told \"The Guardian\": \"Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons.\" \nAt the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that \"Holby City\" be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: \"This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold.\"\nIn 2003, former BBC host Sir Ludovic Kennedy complained that ethnic minorities were over-represented on television, prompting a BBC spokeswoman to explain that \"Holby City\" has more ethnic characters as it is set in an area where minorities account for up to 30% of the population. According to the 2001 census, the population of Bristol \u2013 which the city of Holby is loosely based upon \u2013 is 88% white and 12% ethnic minorities.\nIn October 2003, \"Holby City\" was praised by campaigners for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), when an episode which coincided with \"Learn To Sign Week\" used deaf actors, and featured characters communicating through British Sign Language. RNID chief executive John Low stated: \"Too often individuals have to rely on family members or friends to communicate complicated personal information to professionals. This is the reason the RNID is calling on the government to channel funding into the training of British Sign Language interpreters who could then be available to NHS staff treating deaf patients.\" Stokes commented: \"The writer had a great story he wanted to tell \u2013 for us, that's what matters first and foremost.\"\nIn June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of \"Holby City\", \nA 2008 a Channel 4 report into ethnic diversity on television, cited \"Holby City\" as a positive example of \"diverse British programm[ing]\". \nIn January 2010, Janet Street-Porter in \"The Independent\", said \"Holby City\" had \"come to the end of [its] natural life\" and should be cancelled.\nRealism.\nThe show has been criticised for its lack of realism. \nIn February 2004, nurse Vici Hoban said that there were three nurse stereotypes. \"Sex object, doctor's handmaiden, or angel\". She felt that the media had increased these misconceptions. She said that with \"the syringe-toting serial killer Kelly in \"Holby City\", realism has never been top of TV's agenda.\" Hoban felt that the worst offender at the time was the Channel 4 medical drama \"No Angels\". She described as: \"so inaccurate that it makes \"Holby City\" look like a factual documentary.\" \nIn November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticising \"Holby City\" for misrepresenting real hospital life. \nIn December 2009, Tom Sutcliffe of \"The Independent\" reviewed an episode, finding it \"astonishing\" that any patients leave Holby General alive, as the staff are \"so busy looking stricken or lovelorn at each other\".\nMisuse of alcohol has been criticised.\nIn December 2003, \"The Times\" Libby Purves wrote a critical opinion piece, observing that \"Holby City\" medical staff are often depicted getting drunk in clubs, but afterwards are able to function properly at work, and that as a result, alcohol \"is made to look innocent\". \nIn October 2004, Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of Alcohol Focus Scotland, criticised an episode of \"Holby City\" which saw doctors downing tequila slammers, stating that it glamorised irresponsible drinking. \nIn October 2007, drinks' industry body the Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about a scene in \"Holby City\" which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show the negative consequences of this action, the series was presenting a \"highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking\". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident.\n\"Holby City\" has also been accused of medical inaccuracies. \nIn January 2004, the British Medical Association denounced an episode which showed organ donation being done despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: \"This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme.\" \nIn 2005, the British Medical Association said that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this \"a terrible distortion of the truth.\" \nIn 2009, \"The Times\", Vivienne Parry highlighted the fact that in reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial event. Of those, only a third live to leave hospital. \nIn April 2010, at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth, \"Holby City\" was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling a compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: \"In A&amp;E it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in \"Holby City\", I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it.\"\nImpact.\nIn October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident &amp; Emergency consultant at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised the number of patients visiting the department for minor problems without first seeing their GP. Ryan attributed this to patients watching \"Holby City\" and falsely seeing hospitals as glamorous. \nIn September 2008, a three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting, claimed that watching \"Holby City\" and similar medical dramas such as \"Casualty\" and \"ER\" had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health.\nIn 2008, Conservative Party strategists identified four archetypes based on TV programmes to help the party target swing voters. Alongside \"\"Top Gear\" man\", \"\"Apprentice\" generation\" and \"\"Grand Designs\" couple\", they identified \"\"Holby City\" worker\", a middle-ranking health service worker. In 2009, they identified \"\"Holby City\" woman\" as a key voter demographic who may help the party win the 2010 General Election. The \"\"Holby City\" woman\" is a female voter in her 30s or 40s, employed in a clinical or clerical position or some other public sector job. She is a swing voter in General Elections, The \"\"Holby City\" woman\" archetype is modelled on the character of Faye Morton.\nIn January 2009, Jill Berry, president of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as \"Holby City\" as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: \"The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, as long as they give a realistic impression.\" Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from \"Holby City\" as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"Holby City\" has been nominated for over 100 awards.

Most kafanas feature live music.\nThe idea of a social meeting place for men to drink alcohol and coffee started in the Ottoman Empire and spread to the Balkans while it was under Ottoman rule. Over time, this became the modern kafana.\nEtymology.\nThe word 'kafana' is taken from the Turkish word \"kahvehane\" (\"coffeehouse\") which is in turn taken from the Persian word \"qahveh-khaneh\" (a compound of the Arabic \"qahve\" [coffee] and Persian \"khane\" [house]).\nIn Macedonia, the word \"kafeana\" is sometimes used as if it means the same as \"meana\", while the variant \"kafana\" (adopted from Serbian folk-songs and made popular by artists) may be used for the kafana described in this article; however, both terms are used as if they have the same meaning by some people.\nNowadays in Serbia, the term \"kafana\" is used to describe any informal restaurant serving traditional cuisine, as well as some other kafana dishes like Kara\u0111or\u0111eva \u0161nicla.\nHistory.\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, running a kafana (then usually called \"mehana\") was a family business, passed on from generation to generation.\nAs the Balkan cities grew in size and became more urban, the kafana also changed. Some started serving food and offering other things to customers since the owners now had to compete with other similar places around the city. Most bigger towns and cities in this time had a \"Gradska kafana\" (City kafana) located in or around main square where the richest and most important people of that city would come to see and be seen. Prices in this kafana would usually be higher than others around the city that didn't have such an exclusive location.\nLive music was first used in kafane in the early 20th century by kafana owners looking to offer different kinds of entertainment to their guests. Naturally, since there was no mass media these bands were local and would only play folk music that was popular in the local region.\nAs the 20th century began, Balkan cities saw lots of rural people move in, especially after World War II, and kafane changed for this. Some stayed the same, caring for the upper-class, while others began to change to be better for the new rural population who mostly worked in factories and on construction sites.\nThis is when the word \"kafana\" slowly began to mean something that you did not want and that was only for lower classes of society, like a ghetto. By the 1980s, calling a restaurant a \"kafana\" almost became an insult and most owners would not call their restaurants kafane. Instead, they used words like \"restaurant\", \"cafe\", \"bistro\", \"coffee bar\", &amp;c. instead.\nNow, the kafana is thought of as a place where sad lovers cure their sorrows in alcohol and music, gamblers waste lots of, husbands run away from mean wives while shady businessmen, corrupt local politicians and small criminals do business. Going to kafane often is seen as something that more men would do than women, and \"honest\" women dare only visit finer ones, and usually while they are with men.\nThis is mentioned in late-20th century folk songs, like \"I tebe sam sit kafano\" (\"I'm Already Sick of You, Kafana\") by Haris D\u017einovi\u0107, \"Kafana je moja sudbina\" (\"Kafana is My Destiny\") by Toma Zdravkovi\u0107, and \"\u010ca\u0161e lomim\" (\"I'm Breaking Glasses\"), by Nezir Eminovski."}

The mold is made by using two hardened tool steel dies which are machined into shape. These work like an injection mold.\nMost die castings are made from non-ferrous metals (meaning they do not have iron). These metals are zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and tin-based alloys. Depending on what type of metal is being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.\nThe casting equipment and the metal dies are expensive. This means it is used only on things that need to be made a large number of times. It is simple to make things using die casting, and it has only four main steps. This helps keep the cost of the items lower. Die casting works well for many small- to medium-sized castings, which is why it is used to make more castings than any other casting process. Die castings have a very good surface finish (compared to other types of casting) and consistent sizes."}

He is known for inventing the Segway and founding the non-profit organization FIRST with Woodie Flowers.\nCareer.\nInventions.\nKamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT. It is an electric, self-balancing vehicle. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine had a lot of attention after parts of a book quoting Steve Jobs and other notable IT inventors talking about its revolutionary potential were leaked in December 2001.\nKamen was already a successful inventor: his company \"Auto Syringe\" manufactures and markets the first drug infusion pump. His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in portable dialysis machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology), and an all-terrain electric wheelchair known as the iBOT, using many of the same balancing technologies that were later used on the Segway.\nKamen has worked a lot on a project involving Stirling engine designs. It tries to create two machines: one that would generate power, and the Slingshot that would be a water purification system. He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries. Kamen has a patent on his water purifier, and other patents pending. In 2014, the film \"SlingShot\" was released, which showed Kamen's quest to use his machine to fix the world's water crisis.\nKamen is also the co-inventor of a compressed air device that would launch a human into the air. This would be used to quickly launch SWAT teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, hard-to-reach buildings.\nIn 2009 Kamen stated that his company DEKA was now working on solar powered inventions.\nKamen and DEKA also made the DEKA Arm System or \"Luke\", a prosthetic arm replacement that gives much more fine motor control than other prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.\nFIRST.\nIn 1989, Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a program for students to get people interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2017, FIRST chose to host two international competitions, one in St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Houston, Texas, each a week apart. From 2018 to 2020, it will be held in Detroit, Michigan, instead of St. Louis, Missouri.\nFIRST has many robotics programs for students in grades K-12, including FLL JR. (FIRST Lego League Jr.) for younger elementary school students, FLL (FIRST Lego League) for older elementary school and middle school students, FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) for middle and high school students, and FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) for high school students. In 2017, FIRST held the inaugural event of its first olympics-style competition \u2013 FGC (FIRST Global Challenge) \u2013 in Washington, D.C. \nKamen says that FIRST is the invention he is most proud of. He predicts that the 1 million students who have taken part in the contests so far will create important inventions in the future."}

He worked on engineering design and product development. He also held the Pappalardo Professorship and was a MacVicar Faculty Fellow.\nBiography.\nFlowers was born in Jena, Louisiana on November 18, 1943. He was named after his grandfathers Woodie and Claude. His father, Abe Flowers, was a welder and inventor. His mother, Bertie Graham, was an elementary-school and special education teacher. As a boy, he showed mechanical aptitude like his father, Abe, and he earned the rank of Eagle Scout. When he was seventeen, he and four friends were driving on Louisiana Highway 127 when they were hit head-on by another vehicle that was traveling at about . The accident killed two people in Flowers' vehicle and one in the other. It made him believe what he called \"genetic opposition to violence\" and created his \"fierce, vocal loathing of any spectacle that involves crashing pieces of machinery into each other with deliberate force.\"\nFlowers went to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute and graduated with his B.S. in 1966. He then went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning his M.S. (1968), M.E. (1971), and Ph.D. (1973) under the direction of Bob Mann. His thesis, called \"A man-interactive simulator system for above-knee prosthetics studies,\" was on a robot-like prosthetic knee inspired by Mann's Boston Arm.\nAfter receiving his doctorate (Ph.D.), Flowers began as an assistant professor at MIT. He worked with Herb Richardson on the \"Introduction to Design and Manufacturing\" class. Known by its course number as 2.70 (now 2.007), the class had a design competition to build robotic devices to accomplish a challenge. Flowers took over the class in 1974, changing it into one of the most popular classes at MIT. He changed the challenge every year, always trying to make it more complex and exciting. The competition was shown on TV several years on the PBS show \"Discover the World of Science\". The competition became like a sporting event, and was even jokingly referred to as MIT's true homecoming game. In 1987, Flowers handed the class over to Harry West.\n\"Discover the World of Science\" changed its name to \"Scientific American Frontiers\" in 1990, and Flowers served as its host until 1993 when he was replaced by Alan Alda. In 1990, Flowers began working with Dean Kamen on FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a project to promote science and technology. Taking parts from 2.70, they created the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in 1992. Flowers brought the phrase \"gracious professionalism\" to FIRST, an idea which has since become very important in FIRST rules and culture. Flowers served every year as National Advisor to FIRST. He was active at FIRST events, working as an MC and treated along with Kamen \"like heroes.\"\nAt the 2017 VEX Robotics World Championship, Woodie Flowers was inducted into the STEM Hall of Fame.\nFlowers was a \"Distinguished Partner\" at Olin College, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2007, he received a degree \"honoris causa\" from Chilean university Universidad Nacional Andr\u00e9s Bello. He died on October 11, 2019, in Massachusetts following complications from aorta surgery.\nFRC Woodie Flowers Award.\nIn 1996, the FIRST Robotics Competition created the Woodie Flowers award, which was given to Flowers that year. In years since, the award has served as a way for FRC teams to honor adult mentors. At each FRC regional competition a Woodie Flowers Finalist Award is presented to one adult who was nominated. This qualifies them for the Championship Woodie Flowers Award (WFA) presented at the FIRST Championship."}

Abuse of power is often associated with corruption. Often, presidents are charged with abuse of power because they pressure all of the less powerful politicians into doing things that the other politicians disagree with. Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, was impeached on December 2019 because of a scandal where he agreed with Ukraine to manipulate the 2020 presidential election in exchange for foreign aid."}

The letter may warn to the individual or business that if they do not stop certain behaviour by deadlines set in the letter, then that individual or business may be sued. The same letter may also warn the individual or business to take specified actions in order to avoid being sued. When a cease and desist letter is issued by a public authority, it is called a \"cease and desist order\".\nAlthough cease and desist letters are not exclusively used for stopping copyright infringement, such letters are also used to protect other issues related to intellectual property. The holder of an intellectual property right (i.e. either a copyrighted work, a trademark, or a patent) may send the cease and desist letter to tell a third party (i.e. an individual or business who is not related to the holder of the intellectual property right) that they are infringing intellectual property. The letter may contain either an offer to license the intellectual property or a very clear threat of a lawsuit. A cease and desist letter often causes both parties to make licensing negotiations, and is very often the first step towards a lawsuit.\nIf someone receives many cease and desist letters, it will cost a large amount of money to manage them. Each claim in the letters must be evaluated, and the person or group who receives it will have to decide what to do to sort out the cease and desist letter. Either, they would have to obtain an attorney's opinion letter, prepare for a lawsuit, and perhaps start making suitable alternatives that do not break the holder's intellectual property.\nCease and desist letters are sometimes used to intimidate the offending groups and can be used by corporations to relax the online critical speech of such groups. A company owning a trademark may send such letter to them that they are doing trademark infringement, although the actual use of the trademark by the offending group may fall under a fair use exception (which follows, in the U.S., the protection of free speech under the First Amendment)."}

{"id": "732763", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732763", "title": "Ryukyuan people", "text": "The Ryukyuan people (\u7409\u7403\u6c11\u65cf, Okinawan: \"Ruuchuu minzuku\"; Japanese: \"Ryuukyuu minzoku\") are the natives of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands, a collection of islands located in Japan.\nHistory.\nThe Ryukyuans descend from the J\u014dmon and Yayoi peoples.\nBy the 14th century, numerous chiefs ruled the Ryukyu Islands. In Okinawa, a new chief named Tamagusuku was unpopular among local lords, causing the island to be split into three kingdoms (Ch\u016bzan, Nanzan and Hokuzan). By the 15th century, the island was re-united, causing the Ryukyu Kingdom to be born. In the following centuries, the Ryukyu Kingdom would expand its rule over the Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama islands. They would also become a vassal state of China.\nIn 1609, the Japanese domain of Satsuma took over the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Amami Islands were then ruled by Satsuma, whereas the rest of the Ryukyu Kingdom was turned into a vassal.\nIn 1872, the Ryukyu Kingdom became the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain. In 1879, the Japanese Empire took control of the country.\nAfter Japanese annexation happened, the local cultures and languages of Ryukyu were suppressed. Children who spoke the native Ryukyuan languages at school were punished with dialect cards.\nDuring the Battle of Okinawa (World War II), between 40,000 and 150,000 Okinawans were killed. After World War II ended, the Ryukyu Islands were placed under American administration. The Amami Islands were returned to Japan in 1953, whereas the ofher island groups were returned in 1972.\nCulture.\nIdentity.\nMany Ryukyuans (especially the diaspora communities in Hawaii and Brazil) consider themselves to be different from the Japanese, who mainly inhabit the mainland (Honsh\u016b, Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Shikoku and Hokkaid\u014d).\nOn the other hand, a lot of other Ryukyuans identify as \u201cJapanese\u201d, which is the result of assimilation that dates back to the Meiji Era.\nLanguage.\nHistorically, the Ryukyuans spoke the Ryukyuan languages. Because Japan suppressed them in the past, they are all endangered, with most speakers being elderly. A Japanese speaker wouldn't be able to understand any of the six Ryukyuan languages without any knowledge out of it. Despite this, the Japanese government calls the Ryukyuan languages \u201dJapanese dialects\u201d for political reasons. Most linguists on the other hand refer to the Ryukyuan languages as separate languages.\nReligion.\nThe native religion of the Ryukyuans is the Ryukyuan religion, an animistic faith that believes in ancestor worship. Other religions practiced in Ryukyu include Shintoism, Buddhism and Christianity."}

There is evidence of more than 300 years of celebration, with an active participation of the local population in both religious and festive celebrations. These parties include unique events such as the delivery of the baton, costume contests (both children and adults) as well as the elaboration of \"coca\" and \"pa bene\u00eft\". They take place during the first half of February, they are considered as the winter celebrations of the town and since 2018 they have been recognized as a Festival of Tourist Interest in Aragon.\nOrigin and history.\nIt exists proof of at least three centuries of celebration of Saint Blas and Saint \u00c1gueda in Mequinenza, a tradition that stressed when, with the construction of the reservoir of Riba-red in the years 70, the Old Village remained under the river Ebro and the urban core of the place had to move to his current location to few kilometres water up, to river banks Segre. Historically, the procession of Saint Blas ran to charge of the men and the one of Saint \u00c1gueda to the women, but the natural evolution of the tradition has comported that in the actuality the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa \u00c1gueda are exclusively formed by women that purchase a special leadership during the days of celebration. Saint Blas and Santa \u00c1gueda took importance during the Franco regime, since although it was forbidden to disguise, Mequinenza continued challenging the prohibition imposed by the authorities, a fact that boosted even more the popular rooting and the singular character of the tradition.\nFestivity.\nThe festivity initiates with the delivery of the Clave of Control to the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa \u00c1gueda, to continue the day 3 February with the religious celebrations of Saint Blas and the day 5 with the ones of Santa \u00c1gueda. The day concludes with the known contests of costumes artesanales for small and greater, at the same time that diverse and colourful r\u00faas visit the population accompanied of music in direct. During the celebrations elaborate \u201ccokes\u201d, a sweet typical traditional to base of oil, flour and water, to which adds a secret ingredient that knows only each Commission. The process of preparation of \u201ccokes\u201d transmits of generation in generation through the members of the Commission of Saint Blas and Santa \u00c1gueda.\nTradition, party and colour join during the parties, filling the population during these days of national visitors and foreigners attracted by the big espectacularidad of the handmade costumes. The groups parade by the streets of the place disguised with attires of historical characters, imaginary or of fiction to rhythm of musics varied. The works of preparation of the costumes initiate months before the festivity with an intense work done entirely manually, fruit of the creativity and the wit in which it involves all the population. The festivity of Saint Blas and Santa \u00c1gueda is the expression of the collective effort and the artistic expression of all the population of Mequinenza, as well as a signal of identity and referent in all the Region of the Low/Baix Cinca."}

It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War.\nRifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, givesa spin to a bullet, greatly increasing the range and accuracy of a gun. Before the Mini\u00e9 ball, balls had to be jammed down the rifle barrel, sometimes with a mallet, and after a relatively small number of shots, gunpowder leftovers built up in the spiral grooves, which then had to be cleaned out. The development of the Mini\u00e9 ball was significant, because it was the first projectile that was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons used during the American Civil War, used the Mini\u00e9 ball.\nThe Mini\u00e9 ball did a lot if damage in the American Civil War.

It was shown on ITV. It began in 1964 and finished in 1988. There was a revival from 2001 to 2003.\n\"Crossroads\" was set in a fictional motel in the Midlands. \"Crossroads\" was later called a hotel. The show became a byword for cheap production values. Despite this, the series regularly attracted huge audiences. It had as many as 15 million viewers.\nIt was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling and produced by ATV. In 1981, Central Independent Television took over ATV's broadcast licence and continued the programme until it was cancelled in 1988. In 2001, the series was revived by Carlton Television. It was cancelled again in 2003.\nStorylines.\n1964\u20131988.\nThe original idea of \"Crossroads\" was based around two feuding sisters, Kitty Jarvis, played by Beryl Johnstone, and Meg Richardson, played by Noele Gordon. Meg is a wealthy woman. She had her late husband Charles' insurance money, and compensation money from the council. The compensation was for them building a motorway through her land. Meg used her money to turn her large Georgian house into a motel.\n\"The Crossroads Motel\" was located near the fictional small village of King's Oak. This was on the edge of Birmingham. Meg had two children. A girl named Jill, played by Jane Rossington), born in 1946, and a boy Alexander, born in 1950. Alexander was called \"Sandy\" and played by Roger Tonge.\nThe other sister, Kitty, is married to the unemployed Dick played by Brian Kent. She is not wealthy. Dick and Kitty bought a newsagents and tobacconists shop in the nearby town of Heathbury a few years after the show started. Kitty and Dick had a son called Brian, played by David Fennell, born in 1945. The story idea of the sisters feuding was dropped early in the series.\nCharacters in the show's early years included Meg and Kitty's brother, Andy Fraser, played by Ian Patterson. In 1965, Andy marries motel secretary Ruth Bailey, played by Pamela Greenhall. Other characters in the first series include\nAmy was briefly arrested as a suspected Soviet spy.\nIn 1966, long running character Diane Lawton, played by Susan Hanson arrived. Other additions included\nPerhaps the most memorable character was the \"village idiot\" Benny Hawkins, played by Paul Henry. His trademark was a woolly hat that he wore all the time. His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War. In 1982, they nicknamed the Falkland Islanders \"Bennies\" after the character. Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with \"Stills\" for locals - because they were \"still Bennies\".\nThe series had storylines which were controversial at the time. These include\nThe series also saw black characters appearing regularly. This followed from the 1960s BBC soap \"Compact\". This was also created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling. Melanie Harper, played by Cleo Sylvestre, arrived at the motel in 1970 as Meg's foster daughter. Sylvestre was given the role by producer Reg Watson after press coverage of racial tensions in Birmingham.\nIn 1977, an interracial summer romance took place between Cockney garage mechanic Dennis Harper, played by Guy Ward, and motel receptionist Meena Chaudri, played by Karen David.\nIn 1978, garage mechanic Joe MacDonald, played by Carl Andrews, arrived.\nIn 1981, a storyline about a false accusation of rape.\nIn 1983, a storyline about a test tube baby born to Glenda and Kevin Banks, played by Lynette McMorrough and David Moran.\nIn 1983, the subject of Down syndrome was also raised when a little girl was befriended by three of the regular characters.\nThe character of Meg Mortimer was axed in 1981. She was thought to have died in a motel fire. Later she turned up alive aboard the QE2, about to sail to a new life overseas. Newspapers reported that two endings were planned for Meg. She would either die in the fire or disappear and turn up on the QE2. Viewers were surprised to see producers had used both. Meg returned briefly in 1983 for a reunion with Jill and Adam on their honeymoon in Venice.\nIn 1985, new producer Phillip Bowman was planning to bring the character of Meg Mortimer back into the show as a \"permanent occasional.\" Plans were well advanced when Noele Gordon died in April of that year, aged 65. Edward Clayton was brought back as Jill's ex-husband Stan Harvey to read the lines originally written for Gordon.\nIn 1986, the new character Ray Grice played by Al Hunter Ashton was introduced as part of an attempt to create wider storylines. \n2001\u20132003.\nIn 2001, the show was revived. Changes were made to characters and stories. Jill Chance had married John Maddingham, played by Jeremy Nicholas. She had been widowed and was calling herself Jill Harvey again. This had been her name before her marriage to Adam Chance in 1983. References were also made to the Russell family taking over a \"failing motel\", despite Crossroads having become a hotel in the late 1980s. In the final episode of the original series, the name 'King's Oak Country Hotel' was seen over the entrance doors.\nLack of real links to the past, and the killing of Jill a few months into the new run, turned many fans away. Popular characters in the new \"Crossroads\" included new owner Kate Russell, played by Jane Gurnett. Receptionist Virginia Raven, played by Sherrie Hewson, and womanising deputy manager Jake Booth, played by Colin Wells. The storyline of the final episode was the revelation that the revived series and glamorous hotel had been a dream of supermarket worker and Crossroads fan Angela, with all the other characters revealed as shoppers. Angela even approaches a female customer in the supermarket and tells her she recognises her as \"Tracey Booth from Crossroads\". Tracey's mother-in-law, Kate, was also shown as one of Angela's colleagues in the supermarket.\nProduction history.\nATV era.\n\"Crossroads\" began its run on Monday 2 November 1964. It was shown five days a week. The episodes were recorded \"as live\", a common practice at the time, with few opportunities for retakes. Within a few months, 10 of the ITV companies had started broadcasting the series. Granada never screened it during the 1960s. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) decreed in 1967 that \"Crossroads\" should be reduced to four episodes per week to improve its quality.\nThe series was no longer networked and each ITV station broadcast the show on different days.\nThe series was widely derided by critics who criticised the wobbly sets and fluffed lines, but gained many fans. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's wife Mary complained when the newly formed Thames Television decided to stop showing it in 1968. The decision proved unpopular with viewers and was reversed six months later. As a result of the gap in transmission, viewers in the Thames region were six months behind the rest of the country for several years. In 1972, Granada became the last ITV company to show \"Crossroads\". By the early 1970s it was second only to \"Coronation Street\" in the ratings. In the mid-1970s it beat \"Coronation Street\" gaining audiences of up to 15 million viewers.\nFrom April 1980, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), commercial television's regulator, decided production should be reduced further to three episodes a week. The chairman of the IBA Lady Plowden described the soap opera as \"distressingly popular\".\nATV planned to replace the fourth episode with a spin-off series called \"A Family Affair\" but this idea was dropped. Series star Noele Gordon, who played Meg Richardson, regularly won the \"TV Times\" Most Popular Female Personality viewers award during the 1970s.\nViewers reacted negatively at the dismissal of Gordon in 1981, an action taken by head of programming Charles Denton. He became a \"national hate figure\".\nThe series producer Jack Barton agreed with Denton that Gordon's character had become too dominant.\nWhy Gordon was sacked remains a mystery to TV historians as she was the most popular character on the soap and no real reason was given other than that producers felt it was time for a change. The actress herself was terribly upset by the decision. She was the only cast member on a permanent contract. She had been misled that the meeting where she was dismissed was to be the annual negotiation for the next years contract. In interviews she made it clear that she did not want to go. There is debate about the reason for her dismissal. Some people have said that Gordon's attitude within the company had upset some executives and they simply wanted rid of her. Gordon was very passionate about the soap and would regularly defend it against the many critics. Others believe that ITV found Crossroads an embarrassment and wanted to find a way of decreasing the viewing figures by sacking Gordon. She was the biggest audience draw. With fewer viewers it could be justified to axe it. Whatever the reason, the series never recovered from her loss.\nCentral era.\nATV lost its ITV franchise at the end of 1981. It was ordered by the IBA to reform into Central Independent Television. It took over the franchise on 1 January 1982. It was thought to have little enthusiasm for the programmes it inherited.\nFurther changes were introduced in March 1985, when new filming locations, sets and characters were introduced. Many storylines were about the new motel owner, Nicola Freeman, played by Gabrielle Drake. Long-term characters, such as David and Barbara Hunter, were axed. The theme tune was updated and the opening titles replaced with a longer version. Finally, the show was renamed \"Crossroads Motel\" with the word \"Motel\" added in the opening titles. The closing titles, which had scrolled in multiple 'crossroad' directions since the start, were replaced with conventional scrolling credits.\nIn 1986, a new producer, William Smethurst, took over the series following the sacking of his predecessor, Philip Bowman. Smethurst had been brought in by Central Television's new head of drama, Ted Childs. He ordered changes, creating a wittier serial and improving the production values of the show. Smethurst shifted the story to the nearby village of King's Oak. Yet more long-running characters, such as Diane Hunter and Benny Hawkins, were dropped. This was unpopular with viewers, who telephoned Central in protest.\nFurther changes included the series being renamed \"Crossroads Kings Oak\" for a time, with the intention in the future of shortening this to \"King's Oak\". This final change was overtaken by the decision in June 1987 by Andy Allen, Central's director of programmes, to axe the series. The familiar theme tune was replaced in September 1987 by a new theme composed by Max Early and Raf Ravenscroft. New titles were introduced to accompany the new theme, which featured stills of King's Oak and the new King's Oak Country Hotel. Michele Buck guided the show through its final few months on air as series producer, with William Smethurst still on hand as executive producer.\nIn January 1988, the series was reduced to only two episodes a week, with \"Crossroads King's Oak\" finally coming to an end on 4 April 1988 (the Easter bank holiday). The last, extended episode saw the character of Jill (Jane Rossington) riding off with her lover, John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas). Asked what name she would give the hotel she would be running in her new life, the character remarked, a little sadly, \"I always thought Crossroads was an awfully good name\".\nCarlton era.\nIn 1994, Carlton Television bought Central Television.\nIn April 2000, Carlton announced that they would be reviving \"Crossroads\" for the daytime slot on ITV. The first episode was shown on 5 March 2001. The revived series was sponsored by washing detergent Surf and was broadcast each weekday at 1.30pm and 5.05pm on ITV, with a Sunday omnibus on ITV2. The revived series was also broadcast in Ireland on RT\u00c9 One and in New Zealand on TV One.\nFour characters from the original series returned: Doris Luke (Kathy Staff), Jill Harvey (n\u00e9e Richardson), Jill's ex-husband Adam Chance (Tony Adams), and Jill's daughter Sarah-Jane Harvey (Joanne Farrell/Holly Newman). Initial reactions were favourable. However, changes in the story from the original puzzled fans and did not help ratings. Kathy Staff left in dismay at the amount of sex. She told ITV Teletext she felt it was no longer the family-friendly show she had originally been part of.\nThe story where original character Adam Chance murders ex-wife Jill Harvey three months into the new series' was unpopular with fans. Jane Rossington said she did not want to commit herself to another long run in the show, but warned Carlton it would be suicidal to kill Jill.\nEpisode 137 of the second revived series remains the only episode never to be shown in full on ITV. The lunchtime screening on Tuesday 11 September 2001 began at 14:10 BST. At the halfway commercial-break point however, the programme was interrupted to hand over to ITV News for then very sketchy details of the 9/11 attacks in New York City, USA. As the afternoon went on and the seriousness of the situation became clear, all ITV Network daytime programmes, starting with CITV transmissions at 15:15, were relegated to ITV2 to continue rolling news coverage. The semi-dropped episode was therefore transmitted in full on ITV2 at 17:30 BST. However, at the time, the channel was only available to a small number of viewers able to view the subscription-based ITV Digital, Telewest or NTL. As a result, the episode remains unseen by most of the programme's regular fanbase, including the entire Channel Islands who could not receive ITV Digital. A short re-cap of events in Episode 137 was screened before both the 14:10 and 17:05 showings of Episode 138 on 12 September 2001. The episode was included in the Omnibus edition that Sunday. This also only was shown on ITV2.\nThe series was reduced to four episodes a week from November 2001 until January 2002.\nThe series paused in August 2002. In January 2003, a changed series, under producer Yvon Grace, reappeared. It seemed to be a self-consciously camp parody, with Jane Asher playing a new central character - the glamorous and bitchy Angel Samson. The series also had appearances from Kate O'Mara, and people associated with light entertainment, such as Lionel Blair, Les Dennis and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The revived series also launched the careers of Freema Agyeman (\"Doctor Who\", \"\"), Luke Roberts (\"Holby City\" and \"Mile High\"), Lucy Pargeter, Shauna Shim and Jessica Fox.\nYvon Grace admitted she was aiming the new \"Crossroads\" towards the LGBT TV audience.\nPlans were in place to bring Adam Chance back on a three-month contract in a last attempt to bring in more viewers; actor Tony Adams said that a down-on-his luck Adam would have been taken under Angel's wing as her personal assistant.\nWith ratings continuing to decline, the revived series was axed in March 2003. The final episode was shown on Friday 30 May 2003.\nThe 2003 series was criticised by fans who felt the series had moved away from the 1964-88 series and the 2001-02 series, as well as being \"too gay\".\nTheme tune.\nThe \"Crossroads\" theme tune was composed by Tony Hatch. In 2004 Hatch said:\nA selection of cues were recorded, including \"Meg's Theme\" which eventually became the standard opening theme, \"Kitty's Theme\" which was phased out as action focussed on the motel, the closing theme which combined both \"Meg's\" and \"Kitty's\" themes, and a variety of background pieces.\nA rerecording by The Tony Hatch Sound was issued as a single by Pye Records in 1965. A special arrangement of the theme by Paul McCartney and Wings, was also used from the late seventies, usually when an episode ended with a dramatic event. Central Independent Television's head of music Johnny Patrick rearranged the tune in 1985 for piano and synthesiser, upon the show's relaunch as \"Crossroads Motel\" by producer Philip Bowman. Following William Smethurst's arrival as producer in 1987, this recording was overdubbed with added synthesisers.\nAn entirely new theme aired in late 1987 when the series was relaunched as \"Crossroads, Kings Oak\", composed by Johnny Patrick, with Raf Ravenscroft and Max Early, with the CBSO. This later formed the basis of the single released by actress Shona Linsdey, \"Goodbye\", to commemorate the end of the show in 1988.\nThe 2001 revival brought back the original Tony Hatch theme, this time arranged and performed by TV theme composer Tony Flynn. Another version, in 2003, was arranged by Patrick Dineen and performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic.\nLocations.\nThe fictional Crossroads Motel was in a fictional village near Birmingham called Kings Oak. There are real suburbs in south-west Birmingham called Kings Heath, Kings Norton and Selly Oak). A number of real-life hotels doubled for location filming. The 1982 \"Crossroads Special\" said that the Longshoot Motel in Nuneaton) was used in designing the motel. It is likely that some scenes were filmed there.\nIn 1970, the series gained an O.B unit, giving it the freedom to do location shooting. Originally, Tanworth-in-Arden was used for King's Oak. Outside scenes were only occasionally used. From 1981 more location filming was used. Some early King's Oak location material was also filmed in Wolverhampton.\nThe most famous location, seen in the programme during the 1960s and 1970s, was not a motel. It was the Shropshire Agricultural Institution, now called North Shropshire College. In October 2019 two of the buildings used during filming, a teaching block and Bridden accommodation block were demolished.\nIt has been suggested that \"Crossroads\" was filmed at a 1960s motel on Stratford Road in Alcester Warwickshire. It was called CherryTrees. The buildings were demolished in 2001. A nearby petrol station, since closed, was used in the early 1980s to film a couple of outdoor scenes of the Crossroads garage.\nIn 1982, the fictional motel was destroyed by fire. The revamped motel was filmed at the Golden Valley Hotel (now Jurys Inn) in Cheltenham.\nFrom 1985 filming moved to the Penns Hall Hotel (now Ramada Jarvis Birmingham) in Sutton Coldfield. The changed appearance was explained as being due to rebuilding. New studio sets were also introduced.\nOther locations included the canal (including Gas Street Basin) behind the studios in Birmingham. in the story this was the King's Oak Canal, on which Vera had a barge. The Chateau Impney Hotel, called the Droitwich Hotel in the story, was also used. In 1983, St Laurence's Church in Alvechurch was the setting for Jill and Adam Chance's wedding. Hagley Hall was used for the wedding reception. Helios Health Club in Brierley Hill was used as the location for the Motel Health Club. It was filmed on Mondays when the health club was closed.\nIn 1985, \"Crossroads\" gained its first set of full length opening titles, filmed around Sutton Coldfield, Tanworth-in-Arden and in Birmingham city centre.\nThe revived \"Crossroads\" from 2001 was still set in the West Midlands. Exterior shots were filmed at locations in and around Nottingham, such as Bingham and Redmile.\nThe original series was recorded at ATV's/Central's Broad Street studios in Birmingham, while the revived series was filmed at Carlton Studios in Nottingham.\nCritical reception.\nDespite the popularity of \"Crossroads\" with the viewing public, the show was often criticised by TV reviewers and ridiculed by British comedians. Television historian Hilary Kingsley stated that \"Crossroads\" never failed \"to provide its critics with ammunition. Some of the acting would have disgraced the humblest of village halls; many of the plots were so farcical they could have been written in a bad dream, and much of the dialogue was pathetic.\" \"The Guinness Book of Classic British TV\" noted that \"\"Crossroads\" was the series that no-one seemed to love. Yet at its peak, it was watched by more viewers than any other soap except \"Coronation Street\".\"\nThe revived series also received mixed reviews from critics.\n\"Acorn Antiques\".\nSpoof soap opera \"Acorn Antiques\", created by comedian Victoria Wood as part of \"Victoria Wood As Seen On TV\", is a deliberate parody of \"Crossroads\". The final episode of \"As Seen on TV\" in 1987 features a hoax documentary, 'The Making of Acorn Antiques', in which the actress playing Mrs Overall (Julie Walters) - a character based on \"Crossroads\" characters Amy Turtle and Mavis Hooper - is revealed as a rather grand character who considers herself a huge star. This portrayal, plus a later pretend news item in which it is revealed she has been sacked from the show, both suggest the actress character (later given the name Bo Beaumont in the musical based on the sketches) is based on Noele Gordon, with Bo making her 'goodbye' appearance to the press in headscarf and large sunglasses and making a dramatic speech, just as Gordon did.\nDVD release.\nIn 2005, Network DVD issued four volumes of the series on DVD (UK Region 2). Each volume has 12 of the original ATV episodes. The first volume includes Meg's 1975 wedding, the highest rated episode.\nIn February 2007, \"Crossroads Volume 3\" was released. There are two versions of the DVD, one being a special limited edition, which contains an extra third disc - featuring recently found episodes from 1976.\nIn September 2007, \"Crossroads Volume 4\" was released.\nIn 2008, Network DVD started to release all the surviving episodes in transmission order through its website. The first set of 16 episodes was released in January 2008 and contained some episodes not available on earlier DVD releases.\nThere are 1,700 episodes of \"Crossroads\" in existence; most of these are from Central Television's run of the show from 1982 to 1988.\nA black and white \"Crossroads Archive Volume 1.1\" has also been released, containing the episode from April 1965, along with 2 further episodes, numbered 1884 and 1886 from March 1973. These were both originally made in colour but now survive only as black and white telerecordings.\nOn 2 November 2009, to coincide with the show's 45th anniversary, Network DVD re-released 21 volumes in a 41-disc box-set. Susan Hanson, who played Diane Hunter, appeared on \"The Alan Titchmarsh Show\" and \"Loose Women\" on 6 and 13 November 2009 respectively, to promote the box-set.\nRepeats.\nFrom 1996 until 2001, episodes of the original series were repeated on UKTV channel \"UK Gold\".\nFrom February to September 2015, the original series aired on Big Centre TV on Freeview channel 8 in the Midlands or available online live at 9.00pm each evening Monday to Saturday, which could also be watched free on their catchup service.\nSpin-offs.\nComic strip.\n\"Crossroads\" was adapted into a weekly comic strip in 1972 by Dutch comics artist Alfred Mazure, published in TVTimes."}

It is one of the main styles of international relations theory. It gives the theoretic background to Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. According to Realism, world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors who want power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism.\nDepending on what they see as the cause of the conflict between states, realists can be divided into three classes: Classical realists believe it follows from human nature; neorealists attribute it to the dynamics of the anarchic state system; neoclassical realists believe it results from both, in combination with domestic politics. Neorealists are also divided between defensive and offensive realism. Realists trace the history of their ideas back through classical antiquity, beginning with Thucydides.\nJonathan Haslam defines realism as \"a spectrum of ideas.\" Its theories revolve around four main rules:\nRealism is often associated with Realpolitik, as both deal with the pursuit, possession, and application of power. Realpolitik, however, is an older prescriptive guideline limited to policy-making, while realism is a wider theoretical and methodological paradigm to describe, explain, and predict events in international relations. As an academic pursuit, realism is not tied to ideology; it does not favor any particular moral philosophy, nor does it consider ideology to be a major factor in the behavior of nations. Priorities of realists have been described as Machiavellian, single-mindedly seeking the power of one's own nation over others."}

{"id": "733341", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733341", "title": "Public", "text": "In communication science and public relations, \"public\" mostly means people. The meaning of this is different than other ideas, such as gatherings in social life to talk about people (public sphere). The meaning of this is also talked about in the learning of government (political science), the learning of how humans think (psychology), and the learning of giving things to people (marketing). This word's meaning is very hard to make, as people think that public has different meanings.\nHow the word is created.\nThe word \"public\" comes from the Latin \"publicus\", or \"of the people\".\nDifferent meanings.\nIn the learning of government (politics), \"public\" means a group of people who are related to government (leader group). In psychology and public relations, public has even more different meanings.\nMeaning in psychology.\nIn the year of 1929, John Dewey had the meaning of \"public\" as a group of people who answer the same problem. This means that this meaning is about problems (situational). This definition of \"public\" with \"problem\" is so misunderstood that people made a whole new learning place, called as \"the idea of the public being about problems\" (situational theory of publics) created by James E Gruning, who was so into \"the idea of the public being about problems\u201d that he also thought of \u201cthe idea of the public \"not\" being about problems\", and so made sets that put the ideas of the meaning of public in order. This includes \"the idea of a public without a problem\" (nonpublics), \"the idea of public with a problem\" (latent publics), and \"the idea of public who know they have a problem\" (active publics).\nMeaning in public relations.\nIn this meaning, the meaning of \u201cpublic\u201d is not someone who likes business (stakeholder) or a system of getting and giving things for money (market). This meaning of \"public\" here is that it is a part of a group of multiple people who like business (stakeholder) who all need to solve a problem. This is not a market because it does not have any money moving system (exchange system), and that a \"public\" is created by itself (self-forming) and puts itself in order by itself (self-organizing). The people who are in public relations do things for the \"public\". People who are needed to make a group's dreams come true are named as \"target publics\", and people that help the target publics are named as \"influentials\". Influentials are important, because they give answers to the target public's problems. The \"target publics\" are also important, because their answers to the government problems (like electoral votes) are very important.\nThe public also has rules of being in the public (\"social norms\"), that play a major role in how information is moved.\nSituational or non-situational meaning.\nPublic relations theory shows that the meaning of publics is situational, according to John Dewey and James E. Gruning, and is simply a group of people. According to Gabriel M. Vasquez, a public has people that all know about their common problem and all try to solve that problem (\u201chomo narrans\u201d [Latin for \"storytelling human\"]), and create a list of problems to be solved (agenda-building). For example, Schools are commonly talked about for their agenda-building, on whether they should teach about religion or not (secular). Some people think publics are about the government (political) and last forever.\nBut, other people think that the meaning of public is non-situational. Kirk Hallahan, professor at Colorado State University, thinks that the meaning of public is about another organization, and has public as that it is people who are about (relate) to an organization, who show different amounts of activity\u2014passivity (getting information without giving it), and who might (or might not) talk with others about their relationship with the group.\nTypes of \"public\".\nSocial publics.\nSocial publics are people who like the same ideas or hobbies.\nNetworked publics.\nNetworked publics are social publics who are organized by the new technology. Because of this, networked publics are the result of technologies that connect people (networked technologies, like social media), and the whole result from a combination of the people in the networked public, their technologies, and their ideas.\nPublics and problems.\nThe situational theory of publics, is about the idea that publics can be used and organized by how much they know (are aware of) their common problem, and how much action the group has taken to resolve that problem. This theory shows when people communicate ideas and when the ideas are about the people who are important in solving the common problem. This theory is almost the same as John Dewey's theory of publics and Blumer's theory of publics.\nKey concepts.\nThe five key concepts in this theory are:\nHistory.\nThis theory comes from James E. Grunig's writing, \"The Role of Information in Economic Decision Making\" in 1966. This writing was the beginning of the situational theory of publics, as it had the first key idea, problem recognition, in the writing. Then, when he wrote about the decisions of people who own land in Columbia to become a professor, he also wrote about the second key idea, constraint recognition. He then added Herbert Krugman's idea of the third key idea, level of involvement, to explain the difference between the fourth and fifth key ideas, information seeking and information processing. After that, he wrote a book in 1984 which was named \"Managing Public Relations\", which further made the situational theory of publics make more sense, based on John Dewey's book, which was named \"The Public and Its Problems\".\nDevelopment.\nPeople who use the theory created equations which used the theory to organize the different types of publics, and the most real effects of communication for each public. Because these math rules were created, it made the theory more understandable and became used in a more common way in learning the theory (academic studies) and in some professional learning. This theory is like the learning of the actions of people buy things (consumer behavior), health communication, how media works (media exposure), and the communication of government related ideas (political communication), which are common in other parts of the learning of communication (communication research). But, this theory has more common key ideas and a more developed system of learning and analysis because of the equations. Because of this, it can become more common (popular) and include other smaller less common theories inside it (subsume).\nExtension.\nEven though the theory is well developed, it develops even more common. The theory has been used to show why people join groups who really want things to happen (activist groups), to organize the external (real, actual) and internal (perceived) parts (dimensions) of problem recognition, and to learn whether information that is used in information processing (processed information) can create publics. Also, some more research was done on the internal and external dimensions of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and level of involvement (Grunig &amp; Hon, 1988; Grunig, 1997). The research is about whether the ideas are internal or external. The research shows that if the concepts are internal, they can be changed by communication, and that if they are external, then the holdable things that are around the person need to be changed in order for the person's concept of the variables to change (Grunig, 1997, p.\u00a025). But, there is a small amount of research on the internal and external dimensions of the three key concepts, so there can be more studies on these concepts (Grunig, 1997). Then, in 2011, Jeong-Nam Kim and Grunig extended the theory to the situational theory of problem solving."}

Lots of sans-culottes became radical supporters and fighters for the French Revolution. This was because of their poor quality of life under the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". The word sans-culotte, which is the opposite of aristocrat, was said for the first time on 28 February 1791 by officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan in a bad way. He was talking about a \"sans-culottes army\" - an army of peasants. The word became popular during the demonstrations of June 1792. \nThe name, though it is about clothing, is actually a way to talk about the sans-culottes' social status. \"Culottes\" were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie. The working class \"sans-culottes\" wore \"pantaloons\", or trousers, instead. The \"sans-culottes\", most of them urban labourers, were the force behind the French Revolution. The other members of the revolution thought that they were \"radicals\" because they wanted a direct democracy. This would mean that the people would vote on laws themselves, and that there would be no legislature. Though they had bad clothes and equipment, and got little or no support from the rich, they were most of the Revolutionary army and executed many people during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars."}

The 24 essays in the book come from many sources, including journals, book introductions, and award-acceptance speeches. Le Guin was well known as a fantasy and science fiction author. But her criticism was not easy to find before this collection. \"The Language of the Night\" has [Le Guin]'s most important ideas about writing. It is about topics such as Americans' attitudes towards fantasy fiction, the strengths and weaknesses of science fiction, and how children's literature is special. She also discusses the background of her major works such as \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" and \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". However, some critics complained that \"The Language of the Night\" has both more important and less important writing. The collection was nominated for a Hugo for Best Related Non-Fiction Book category in 1980. The title comes from Le Guin's description of fantasy literature. She said, \"We like to think we live in daylight, but half the world is always dark; and fantasy, like poetry, speaks the language of the night.\""}

He put his photographs into a video and released it on YouTube.\nIn December 2006, because \"Everyday\" was so popular, VH1 asked Noah to take photographs of himself in the same pose as he did in \"Everyday\", but with some celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Lance Bass, David Hasselhoff, Jenna Jameson, will.i.am, Flavor Flav, lonelygirl15 and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. The photographs were taken backstage at the VH1 Big in '06 Awards. In the ceremony, which was shown on television, several of the pictures were shown before and after commercial breaks. Kalina also posted the photographs on Flickr.\nOn July 16, 2012, Noah announced an longer version of the video, called \"Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 12.5 years\", on his website. The video, which came out on YouTube on September 4, 2012, shows 12 years and 5 months of his photographs of himself over 7 minutes and 34 seconds (10 frames per second, or 1 month every 3 seconds).\nOn January 14, 2020, Noah released \"Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 20 years\" on YouTube. This video shows 20 years of his photographs of himself over 8 minutes and 17 seconds (15 frames per second, or 1 month every 2 seconds).\nNoah Kalina.\nNoah, who was born on July 4, 1980, lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Centerport, New York, and went to Harborfields High School. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts.\nIn popular culture.\n\"The Simpsons\" episode \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" includes a parody of the video, in which all 39 years of Homer Simpson's life are shown in the same way.\n\"Family Guy\" also has a parody of the video, in which Peter Griffin takes a picture of himself every day for one year in the same way, except the song \"Hey There Delilah\" by the Plain White T's is used.\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) used the song in \"Where Amazing Happens\", an advertising campaign that happened from 2007 to 2008."}

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of February 19, 2021, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories. More than three million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 85 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease. \nThe virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining.\nThe outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic.\nRacism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.\nIn November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Both are over 90% effective. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people.\n 17 other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed. \nThe United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 600,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country. \nEpidemiology.\nEpidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.\nBackground.\nOn 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.\nOn 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends.\nCases.\nCases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University.\nDeaths.\nMost people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. This data are recorded by the WHO.\nDuration.\nOn 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled.\nSymptoms.\nAccording to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, which can often be confused with the flu virus. \nAccording to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea, but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.\nName.\nIn February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name \"2019-nCoV.\" \"Covi\" is for \"coronavirus,\" \"D\" for \"disease,\" and \"19\" for the year 2019 \u2013 the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word \"Wuhan.\" They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.\nMortality rate of COVID-19.\nAccording to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study.\nOn March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate.\nRace and racism.\nCOVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, \"The New York Times\" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick.\nCamara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work. This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem.\nIn June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status.\nIn the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons.\nIndigenous peoples.\nNative Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands.\nScientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane.\n The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own.\nGeorge Floyd protests.\nIn May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest.\nAfrican Americans.\nAfrican Americans are more likely to catch the virus compared to their white counterparts in the United States, and are also more likely to die from it. 50,000 African Americans died of COVID-19 in 2020. African Americans are the least likely to get vaccinated against the disease.\nRomani people.\nRomani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19.\nHispanics.\nLatinos have been at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in the United States.\nConspiracy theories.\nIn early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks.\nOn March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in \"Nature Medicine\" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.\nTimelines of COVID-19.\nOn December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province. \nOn January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, including in every province-level division of China. A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. but another source reported:\n\"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan\".\nThere has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, some of whom are healthcare workers.\nConfirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States (Everett, Washington and Chicago), Singapore, Vietnam, France and Nepal.\nThe World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.\nBloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures, travel restrictions, and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak.\nAs of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nOn November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories.\nFood and hunger.\nThe pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat.\nIn April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems.\nThis hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home.\nAll over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down.\nScientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said one in seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns.\nOld people.\nIn the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death, \n40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.\nMany people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.\nSome of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients.\nEnvironment.\nBecause so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work.\nThe pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less.\nPollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.\nThe shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins. With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one.\nNot all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed.\nStopping the next pandemic.\nResearchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people.\nPrevention and treatment.\nAvoiding traveling and staying home will greatly reduce your risk from catching COVID-19. Staying home doesn't apply if one is sick and needs medical care. Get enough rest and stay hydrated. Wearing a mask and washing your hands can prevent the virus from spreading. Masks should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing, have a respiratory or other medical condition which renders one unable to wear a mask safely, or anyone who is unable to remove the mask without help. Covering coughs and sneezes also reduce the risk of spreading the virus, but one can infect someone else by touching things with coughed/sneezed-in hands. Making sure not to share drinking glasses, cups and particularly other objects which people will drink or eat out of is important if one assumes they are infected or tested positive in the past. Washing eating utensils and other oral eating objects is preferable and cleaning surfaces or possessions which have been repeatedly touched is also important. These include, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with your hands. Avoiding public transportation, taxis or taking rides with others can stop one's exposure to the virus. Rumors spread about high doses of Vitamin C preventing COVID-19, but these as of October 14, 2020, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. However, there has been evidence pointing to the fact that dosing patients with Vitamin C, either through mouth or IV can reduce time on mechanical ventilators for seriously ill patients by 14%.Drinking tea such as black tea and green tea can inhibit the virus. Staying home for the holidays, having a small gathering of close friends and family members who are consistently taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and celebrating virtually through social media can prevent being infected by the virus. Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to catching the virus. Eating a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, getting rest and sleep, exercising, consuming raw honey, probiotics, garlic, mushrooms and elderberry can boost the immune system. Playing video games to pass time during quarantine can prevent the virus from spreading. Flavanols and proanthocyanidins which are chemicals found in dark chocolate, grapes and green tea may block SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Places you are most likely to catch the virus are churches, hair and nail salons, cruise ships, hospitals and the doctor\u2019s office, restaurants and bars, theaters, sporting events, concert venues, buses, restrooms, elevators, the gym, airplanes, hotels, public swimming pools, nightclubs and the beach. Vaccinated people still need to wear a mask. Flying in a private jet can prevent the spread of coronavirus. Smoking marijuana and tobacco can further damage your lungs. Getting vaccinated can prevent new virus strains."}

{"id": "733962", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733962", "title": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "text": "SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19. It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe virus started the 2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak. The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.\nMany early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic.\nOrigins.\nThe genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronaviruses (96%). This means the virus may have originally come from bats. Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host, meaning another animal in between bats and humans. The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans. Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries. But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines, so they are often sold on the black market.\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it. They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation. Scientists are studying bats because of this.\nScientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks which has become a huge problem worldwide. It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery.\nName.\nIn early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus \"2019-nCoV,\" for \"novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019.\" The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number.\nHow the virus causes disease.\nFirst, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 \".\" ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors.\nSARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs. Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze.\nThe expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.\nLung damage.\nScientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels.\nCOVID-19.\nIn February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. \"Covi\" for \"coronavirus,\" \"D\" for \"disease,\" and \"19\" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like \"Wuhan,\" or \u201cpangolin,\u201d because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.\nSymptoms.\nAccording to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things.\nAccording to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.\nPainkilling.\nA study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain. It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor. This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain.\nShape.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA) Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the \"viral envelope\", or outer layer, of the virus.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a \"positive-strand\" RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do.\nConspiracy theories.\nIn early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon. When the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: \"I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?\" said Khamenei.\nOne survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.\nOn March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in \"Nature Medicine\" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. The paper in \"Nature Medicine\" soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time.\nMedicines.\nThere are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19, but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable.\nIn April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice.\nAnother team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce.\nIn late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.\nIn mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.\nHydroxychloroquine.\nSome people think hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients.\nUnited States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In early April, the \"New York Times\" reported that President Trump has \"a small personal financial interest\" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth.\nIn early April, Fauci said, \"The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect.\" Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems. Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis. Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk.\nScientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine. They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment. Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects. Both studies were published in May 2020.\nRemdesivir.\nSome scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against some viruses. Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.\nIn one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.\nThe chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.\nIn October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive."}

There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted."}

It is about what happens after a terrorist attack at a football match. It is directed by Sharon Maguire. It stars Michelle Williams, Ewan McGregor, and Matthew Macfadyen. It is about a suicide bombing at the Emirates Stadium during an Arsenal F.C. match, and about the life of a woman who loses her husband and young son in the attack. It is based on the 2005 novel \"Incendiary\" by Chris Cleave.\nPlot.\nA young East Ender woman, played by Michelle Williams, is married to bomb-disposal officer Lenny, played by Nicholas Gleaves. They have a four-year-old son, played by Sidney Johnston.\nThe young mother is having an affair with a reporter called Jasper, palyed by Ewan McGregor. Lenny, their son, and about 1000 others are killed in a terrorist attack carried out by six suicide bombers at a football match. \nTerrence Butcher, played by Matthew Macfadyen, is in charge of the anti-terrorist division.\nJasper and Terrence try to comfort the mother. Both are also romantically interested in her.\nThrough Jasper's investigation into the bombing, the mother discovers the identity of one of the terrorists. She befriends his teenage son, played by Usman Khokhar. He only knows that his father is missing since the attacks. When he finds out what his father did, he panics and runs. This causes the police to suspect him to be a terrorist. When he tries to take something out of his pocket they think he has a gun or wants to trigger a bomb. They shoot at him, but he is unarmed. The mother, who tried to protect him, is wounded, but not severely. Later, the terrorist's wife and son apologize to the mother for his part in the killings.\nTerrence confesses to the mother that he knew that a suicide attack was going to happen and could have stopped it. He did not stop it so that he was able to continue his investigation of the terrorist group. He says that he did not know in which stadium it would happen, and also thought it would be of a smaller scale. Although he knew Lenny and his son would be going, he did not warn them.\nSometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack.\nProduction.\nFilming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge.\nThe production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded.\nReception.\nThe film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an \"ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone.\"\nPhilip French called it an \"ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script.\"\n\"Time Out\" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote \"there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire\u2019s first film since \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis\"; the film at times seems like a \"study of guilt and grief\" and at other times a \"conspiracy thriller\" but \"ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film\u2019s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character.\""}

The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie \"Escape Room\".\nPlot.\nAfter escaping the \"sole survivor\" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City\u2013based headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying.\nThe pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the \"winners\" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain.\nThe next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before.\nThe next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.\nZoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die.\nThe next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down.\nFilled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she realizes her therapist was in on it and that the plane is another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin.\nCast.\nIsabelle Fuhrman and James Frain appear in the film's alternate version as Claire and Henry, respectively, in a plotline revealing the puzzlemaker's story. Tanya van Graan makes an uncredited appearance as Sonya, who is Henry's wife and Claire's mother in this cut.\nAdditionally, Lucy Newman-Williams appears as Zoey's therapist and Scott Coker portrays an FBI agent in the theatrical cut. In both versions, Matt Esof portrays the vagrant who lures Zoey and Ben into Minos' trap.\nProduction.\nOn January 27, 2020, director Adam Robitel posted on social media confirming that filming on the movie had wrapped."}

It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records.\nWhen the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles \"Welcome to the Jungle\", \"Paradise City\" and \"Sweet Child o' Mine\". It was first on \"Billboard\" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time.\nAlthough critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, \"Appetite for Destruction\" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too.\nBackground.\nGuns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after forming, with \"Don't Cry\", a cover of \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"Think About You\" and \"Anything Goes\". However, the EP did not happen, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band.\nAfter playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP \"Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide\", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP.\nSinger Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for \"Appetite for Destruction\", such as \"Back Off Bitch\", \"You Could Be Mine\", \"November Rain\" and \"Don't Cry\". \"November Rain\" was not put on the album because \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad.\nProducer Spencer Proffer was hired to record \"Nightrain\" and \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"Don't Cry\", \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and \"Shadow of Your Love\". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)\nThe band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded \"Shadow of Your Love\" first with Clink as a test.\nIn 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman) to \"spruce up\" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie \"Big Daddy\" in 1999.\nTrack listing.\nSuper deluxe edition.\nThe \"Locked N' Loaded\" Edition and the \"Super Deluxe Edition\" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album.\nA fifth disc is included; a Blu-ray disc, which has 96\u00a0kHz 24-bit 5.1 Surround Sound &amp; Remastered Stereo mixes, mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti. It includes all of \"Appetite for Destruction\", alongside bonus tracks \"Shadow of Your Love\", \"Patience\", \"Used to Love Her\", \"You're Crazy\", and \"Move to the City (1988 Acoustic version)\".

{"id": "735013", "revid": "109566", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=735013", "title": "The Brittas Empire", "text": "The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.\nChris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.\nThe show ran for seven series and 52 episodes \u2014 including two Christmas specials \u2014 from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.\n\"The Brittas Empire\" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" poll.\nThe show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in \"The Brittas Empire\".\nPlot summary.\nGordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives.\nHelen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent.\nBrittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss.\nEpisodes.\n\"The Brittas Empire\" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called \"Get Fit with Brittas\".\nFor the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank.\nHowever, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.\n'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre.\nIn 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix.\nDVD and VHS releases.\nAll seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s.\nCritical response.\nCritics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that: \nIn its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, \"The Brittas Empire\" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch.\nInfluence.\nThe show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and \"The Office\".\nSetting.\nThe exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire."}

An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.\nMax Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals."}

Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a \"wash out\" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.\nThe tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that \"to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test\". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects \"in vitro\" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.\nOther tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs. "}

Its administrative center was the small city of Misurata on the Mediterranean coast.\nIt was divided in three sections (\"Circondari\" in Italian):\nThe population in the 1939 Census was of nearly 225,000 inhabitants, most of which were Arabs and Berbers. The Italians were nearly 10,000 and were concentrated in Misurata, Homs and some newly created villages for Italian colonists (Gioda, Crispi, Littoriano, Corradini, etc.)\nMost of the population was Muslim, but there was a growing community of Catholics due to the Italian colonists immigration. Additionally there were nearly one thousand Jews in Misurata.\nThe province from 1939 was considered officially part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so-called \"Quarta Sponda\" (Fourth Shore) of Mussolini's Greater Italia. Indeed on January 9, 1939, the colony of Italian Libya was incorporated into \"metropolitan Italy\" and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state (the French, in 1848, had incorporated \"French Algeria\" in the same manner)."}

Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes. Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey directed three episodes each.\nIt was made by Hartswood Films and Stagescreen Productions. The series also got funding from BBC America.\nThe series is a sequel to the novella \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", and not an adaptation of it. The Robert Louis Stevenson tale is used as a backstory within the series.\nIt stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll. He has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman appears as Claire, Tom's wife.\nFilming took place around southern England in late 2006. The series was first shown on BBC One in June and July 2007.\nPlot.\nDoctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) is a married father of two. He has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Katherine, he straps himself into a metal chair and undergoes a transformation.\nKatherine observes that Tom's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, strength and speed, and a flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Tom's. She asks for guarantees he will not harm her. Tom's alter ego takes Hyde's name. The two agree an uneasy truce. They share a body, but neither remembers what the other did while in charge. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other.\nWhen Tom began transforming into the violent Hyde, he feared for his family's safety. He chose to isolate himself from them. He visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During the visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Tom's family.\nMiranda Callendar, played by Meera Syal, is a detective employed by Claire. She tells Tom that \"Jekyll and Hyde\" was not fiction, but a version of actual events. Miranda shows Tom a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh in the 19th century. Tom is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him.\nTom is also being watched by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin, played by Paterson Joseph. The team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson. The team is directed by his friend Peter Syme, played by Denis Lawson.\nWhen Benjamin puts Tom's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, and kills a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears.\nTom confronts Peter, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Peter and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Tom's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin. Peter says that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Tom is captured and locked inside a metal coffin.\nKatherine and Miranda confront Peter, claiming they know the truth about Tom. Miranda thinks that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Tom is Jekyll's clone. Peter denies this and orders them taken away to be killed.\nPeter reveals to Claire that Tom's treatment will make him into one persona. If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research. They will make the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde. If it is Tom, she will be free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant.\nIn a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Tom's own life show his Hyde first appeared during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans.\nEnraged by further threats to Tom's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate. She locks the twins in miniature versions of the coffin used on their father.\nTom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Tom is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, through Mr Hyde, and by chance \"a perfect throwback, a chance in a million\". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had watched him from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself.\nHyde tries to rescue Tom's family from Klein and Utterson. He kills Peter. There is a stand-off, with Tom and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Tom to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality.\nSix months later, Tom has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde. He had inherited the family curse from her. As Tom watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the red-headed Ms Utterson.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nJeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had the idea of a modern version of \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" in the mid-1990s. He attempted to get it produced in the United States, but all three attempts fell through. He returned to England and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was looking for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron approached Steven Moffat for a script. A six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.\nBBC America gave co-production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. The producers invited Moffat to \"write anything\", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of \"Jekyll\" begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series.\nMoffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation. He said the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his \"modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems\". As \"Jekyll and Hyde\" is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon \"Jekyll\" because that word \"carries the name Hyde\". The final episode replaces the title \"Jekyll\" with \"Hyde\". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a \"very modern feel\". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde.\nThe scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of \"The Star-Ledger\" that he had a sequel written for the miniseries \"should the BBC be interested\".\nFollowing \"Jekyll,\" Moffat became a co-writer on \"Sherlock.\"\nCasting.\nJames Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of \"Murphy's Law\". At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for \"Jekyll\", suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention.\nMichelle Ryan was revealed to have been cast as Jekyll's assistant, Katherine Reimer, in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job.\nMoffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom \"Coupling\". Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.\nMeera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clich\u00e9d private detective and she thought the humour was \"fresh\". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five.\nOther roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson and Al Hunter Ashton as Christopher.\nProduction.\nThe series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde \"soulless\". The producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script.\nFilming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode. Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den. Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster-designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein &amp; Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006.\nThe production team had twelve days to shoot each episode. Director Douglas Mackinnon says this was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not \"being precious\" over his material during the editing process. His willingness to cut superfluous material meant that he was taken seriously when he argued for something to be retained.\nThe music was composed by Debbie Wiseman.\nBroadcast and reception.\n\"Jekyll\" was shown on BBC One on Saturday nights at 9p.m. A two-week break occurred between showings of the third and fourth episodes because the Live Earth benefit concert was broadcast during its timeslot on 7 July.\nThe series began on BBC America from 4 August 2007, as part of a \"Supernatural Saturday\" programming strand.\nIn Australia, \"Jekyll\" began on ABC1, Sundays at 8.30 p.m. from 2 March 2008. There was a double episode back-to-back each week. In Canada, \"Jekyll\" began on Showcase, at the end of August 2007 and on BBC Canada, Wednesdays at 10:00\u00a0p.m. from 26 March 2008. In Hong Kong, Wednesday at 11:55\u00a0p.m. from 11 February 2009 on TVB Pearl. In the Netherlands, \"Jekyll\" was broadcast in the summer of 2009 on Sci-Fi Channel.\nCertain edits were made to the United Kingdom broadcasts in order to remove language unsuitable for Saturday night BBC One audiences. For example, a line spoken by Hyde in episode one was changed from \"Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?\" to \"Who the hell is Mr Hyde?\"\nJames Jackson of \"The Times\" rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde \"as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen \"Doctor Who\" villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot\". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that separates this series from other adaptations. \"The Daily Telegraph's\" Stephen Pile criticised the script for \"veering between Hammer horror and larky humour\". James Walton called the first episode a combination of \"a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches\". David Cornelius of \"DVDTalk\" said \"six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event\".\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said \"This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards.\nHome release.\nThe BBFC rated all episodes as a 15 certificate on 11 June 2007. \"Jekyll: Season One\" was released for region 2 on 30 July 2007 by Contender Home Entertainment. It includes uncut episodes, including restoration of some swearing cut from the BBC broadcasts. As DVD Verdict says about this uncut version, \"the language is saucier, the violence a bit more bloody, and the sex more primal.\" The disc contains audio commentaries on two episodes: producer Elaine Cameron, writer Steven Moffat and first-block director Douglas Mackinnon comment on episode one, while executive producer Beryl Vertue, second-block director Matt Lipsey and actress Gina Bellman comment upon the sixth episode. The set also contains two documentaries: \"Anatomy of a Scene\" focuses upon the production of the zoo sequence in episode two, while \"The Tale Retold\" covers the evolution of the series. The first Region 1 release occurred in the United States on 18 September 2007, although the Region 1 Canadian release was delayed until 9 October, following the Canadian broadcast of the series on Showcase, which commenced at the end of August 2007.\nAmerican remake.\nIn May 2016, Variety reported that Lionsgate will develop an adaptation of the BBC miniseries with Ellen DeGeneres and Jeff Kleeman In July 2016, it was announced that Chris Evans would play the leading role. In December 2016, it was announced that Ruben Fleischer will direct the film."}

A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in \"Harristown\". Harris owned every other lot in Harristown. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes were built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, people in the town created a local government as \"Ayden.\" Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant. In 1922, the Mutual Building and Loan Association of Ayden was organized to help families obtain mortgages (or loan) to build homes in Ayden.\nAfter experiencing tough times during the Great Depression, and after the Second World War, the town began to grow. As the town got bigger, they made commercial, cultural, religious, and other establishments within and around Ayden. The community is still growing today, thanks to the continued development of Greenville.

The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines."}

It was produced by London Weekend Television for the ITV network. It is about the lives of members of the London Fire Brigade at the fictional Blackwall fire station. It began with a TV movie pilot, shown on 7 December 1986. There were 14 series. They ran from 20 February 1988 to 25 August 2002.\nTV movie.\nJack Rosenthal's original two-hour TV movie was shown on ITV on 7 December 1986.\nIt was directed by Les Blair. The Broadwater Farm riot inspired the screenplay.\nThe series.\nSeries 1\u20133 (1988\u20131990).\nThe TV show was a weekly episodic drama that began on 20 February 1988. Paul Knight was the show's producer. Writers included Anita Bronson, David Humphries, Simon Sharkey, and Tony Hoare (writer). Directors included Gerry Poulson, Gerry Mill, John Reardon, Keith Washington and Alan Wareing. Emergencies, called 'shouts', would not only be fires, but included a range of incidents from cats up trees to major road accidents. Each episode ran for 50 minutes (one hour with advertisement breaks). The first series had five episodes. The second and third series each had eight episodes. Episodes were mostly filmed at Dockhead fire station in Bermondsey in London. Real firefighters working shifts were extras on the programme. A studio near the station was used for crowded mess scenes. They also used the fire station's actual mess, bay and watchroom throughout the series.\n'Ding Dong Merrily' Christmas special.\nA Christmas special was transmitted between series 1 and 2 on 25 December 1988, on ITV. The special followed Blue Watch on duty on Christmas Day.\n'Stunts and Stars' documentary.\nOn 8 September 1991, a special 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary started the fourth series. This documentary was also released onto VHS video, by Clear Vision Video. It was then added as a DVD extra, on the Series 4 DVD release by Network DVD.\nSeries 4 (1991).\nIn 1991, LWT commissioned 10 episodes for Series 4. It became the most popular series of the drama. Paul Knight had appointed Brian Clark as the Fire Brigade Advisor. The writers, directors, and Clark decided on a climax to the fourth series. The mental state of one of the main characters deteriorates after being buried alive under a collapsed wall. This is during a spectacular 20-pump warehouse fire. Series 4's climax won the programme a record rating of 18.86\u00a0million viewers.\nSeries 5 (1992).\nEach series now included a major disaster or \"shout\". In Series 5, a spinning wheel ride at a fairground is jammed by a youth, played by Liam McGuire, armed with a pole. The ride collapses, and there is a huge fire with people trapped in the crushed metal. The series attracted 17 million viewers.\nSeries 6\u20139 (1993\u20131996).\nIn the early 1990s, the ratings averaged 17\u201318\u00a0million viewers. In 1995 (Series 8), ratings fell to 16\u00a0million viewers.\nPaul Knight decided it was time for a tragic exit for one of the main characters. The man who was to be killed was Sub Officer John Hallam. Hallam was killed off in 1996 (Series 9) during a huge warehouse fire. He and his colleague, Leading Firefighter Geoff Pearce, were attempting to rescue four teenage girls. They were on an unstable gantry above a blaze in the basement. Hallam held the gantry steady for Pearce as he walked across with one of the girls. As Hallam attempted to cross, the gantry cracked and Hallam fell to his death. The writers developed a storyline about Pearce feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt after the accident, which would lead to him considering a transfer.\nSeries 9 attracted 16.8\u00a0million viewers.\nSeries 10 (1997).\nSeries 10 was the last series produced by Paul Knight. It had 18 episodes. It focused on the crew's domestic lives rather than firefighting work. Budget cuts led to scenes being done with computer-generated imagery. Notable 'shouts' included ones at a paint factory and another at a bus depot.\nSeries 11\u201314 (1998\u20132002).\nThe new producer was David Shanks. Series 11, 12 and 13 saw the return to firefighting scenes as the primary focus. Series 14 was almost completely based on soap opera-style story lines, with the number of fire 'shouts' severely reduced. Viewing figures slumped as the series was critically panned. In 2002 \"London's Burning\" was cut from the schedule; the final episode was broadcast on 25 August 2002 in a two-hour slot.\n'Duty Log' video special.\nIn 2000 a 90-minute behind-the-scenes special was released on VHS video.\nTheme music.\nThe \"London's Burning\" theme used in Series 1\u201310 was composed by Simon Brint, Rowland Rivron, and Roddy Matthews. Series 11\u201313 used a theme composed by Warren Bennett. The series 14 theme was composed by Stuart Hancock and Toby Jarvis and produced at London-based music production house Mcasso Music. Hancock also composed the original incidental music score to all episodes of series 14.\nOpening titles.\nSeries 1\u201310 lacked a title sequence. The episodes opened with the text \"London's Burning\". It was in Futura bold condensed typeface and was superimposed in white over the opening scene of the episode. Series 11\u201313 used a montage of action shots superimposed over a fiery background as the text \"London's Burning\" superimposed in gold and black slowly grew in size over the course of the sequence. It quickly zoomed to fill the screen on the final musical flourish. Series 14 used a shorter montage of action and character shots before the text \"london's burning\" in orange and white appeared and moved closer together over a shot of fire engines emerging from the station.\nLocations.\nThe first few series used Dockhead Fire Station at 8 Wolseley Street, London SE1, as the exterior for Blackwall. The Jacob Street studio is opposite. It had a full scale reproduction of the mess, built by Colin Monk. The actual station mess was also used in the series, as were many other parts of the station and its actual firefighters. Dockhead is still an operational fire station but the original station building was demolished and replaced in 2015.\nThe Swan and Sugar Loaf pub, which featured as the firefighters' local pub, has since been converted to flats. The location is about 800 metres from Tower Bridge.\nThe Restaurant opened by Mike 'Bayleaf' Wilson in series 9 was filmed on location at The Chequers Inn, Deal, Kent.\nLater series used the exterior of Leyton Fire Station and the Oliver Twist pub opposite.\nDVD Releases.\nAll series of London's Burning were released between 2005 and 2011.\nLater showings.\nAs of 6 January 2019, Drama is re-showing \"London's Burning\" at one episode per weekday (2.20\u20133.20 pm Monday to Friday)."}

It has been an influential movement in Argentine politics. Since 1946 Peronists have won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party. The ideas of each president were different, but the general ideology has been described as \"a vague blend of nationalism and labourism\" or populism.\nJuan Per\u00f3n became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions, and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition he helped industrialists. Per\u00f3n was very popular and gained even more admiration through his wife, Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was loved by the people. Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Per\u00f3n in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it wasn't until 1973 that open elections were held again. In the 1973 election, Per\u00f3n was again elected president. He died the next year and his widow, Isabel, took his place as president. Per\u00f3n's death had led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976.\nPeronist Carlos Menem was president from 1989 to1999. His policies were very different from previous Peronists, he focused on privatization, free-market policies, and international relations. Peronist N\u00e9stor Kirchner was president from 2003 to 2007, and his wife Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner was president from 2007 to 2015. According to the Economist, the Kirchners returned to \"economic nationalism and near-autarky\". The ideology of the Kirchners is known as Kirchnerism."}

A crossfader on a DJ mixer may be used to fade between two records simultaneously.\nWhile scratching is most associated with hip hop music, where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of rap rock, rap metal and nu metal. In hip hop culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ's skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the DMC World DJ Championship and IDA (International DJ Association, formerly known as ITF (International Turntablist Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched \"hooks\" often use portions of other songs.\nSubculture.\nWhile scratching is becoming more and more popular in pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the DJ subculture. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz from San Francisco focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs Q-Bert, Disk &amp; Shortkut and later Mix Master Mike. In July 2000, San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided \u201cthe education and development of skratch music literacy\u201d. In 2001, Thud Rumble became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.\nIn 2004, \"Scratch Magazine\", one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and record producers, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known \"Tablist\" magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an MC at events, and perform club sets.\nUse outside hip hop.\nScratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including pop, rock, jazz, some subgenres of heavy metal (notably nu metal) and some contemporary and avant-garde classical music performances. For recording use, samplers are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record.\nDJ Product\u00a91969, formerly of the rap rock band Hed PE, recalled that the punk rock band the Vandals was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching. Product\u00a91969 also recalled the early rap metal band Proper Grounds, which was signed to Madonna's Maverick Records, as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music.\nGuitarist Tom Morello, known for his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, has performed guitar solos that imitate scratching by using the kill switch on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is \"Bulls on Parade\", in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a crossfader.\nSince the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as nu metal, exemplified by Linkin Park, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. Nelly Furtado) and alternative rock (e.g. Incubus). Scratching is also popular in various electronic music styles, such as hard-groove techno."}

He uploaded a clip of the song to YouTube, and to several Reddit groups.\nOn July 9, 2019, YouTuber Justin Whang released an episode of his video series \"Tales from the Internet\". The episode talks about the progress of the search up to then. When the video was released, more internet users have tried to help to identify the song. \nAfter the video came out, some progress was made. The whole song was found and posted by a Reddit user in July 2019. Furthermore, people who might have known the song were contacted. This includes people such as Paul Baskerville, who was the DJ of the show from which the song was likely recorded. He has said he does not remember the song.

Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.\nMost of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers connect the rituals to taboos.\nSome have seen benefits of these practices for health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move us away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift us towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context)."}

One teacher of the Conservatory, who left a deep mark on Kyli\u00e1n\u00b4s professional development, was Zora \u0160emberov\u00e1, known for her world\u00b4s first interpretation of Juliet (1938) in Prokofiev\u2019s famous ballet.\nIn 1967 Kyli\u00e1n had received a scholarship to study at the \"Royal Ballet School\" in London,\nStuttgart Ballet.\nHe met John Cranko, choreographer, there, who offered him a contract, to become a member of his acclaimed \"Stuttgart Ballett\". Before taking up his contract, Kyli\u00e1n shortly returned to Prague, but on August 21st, 1968, the invasion of the communist \"Warsaw-Pact \" forces began. On the 28th of August, after taking part in many demonstrations against the occupation, Kyli\u00e1n left for Germany.\nIn Stuttgart Cranko asked Kyli\u00e1n to create choreographies for the company. His first work was \"Kommen und Gehen\", created with Marcia Hayd\u00e9e and Richard Cragun. In the early 70\u2019s Cranko invited Glen Tetley to become resident choreographer in Stuttgart. Tetley\u00b4s work made a great impression on Kyli\u00e1n, namely Tetley\u2019s understanding of movement, and its relation to space, was a revelation for Kyli\u00e1n.\nNetherlands Dance Theatre.\nIn early seventies, Kyli\u00e1n was invited to create his first choreography for the Netherlands Dance Theatre (\"Viewers-1973\"). Having created two more works for NDT (\"Stoolgame\" 1974 and \"La Cath\u00e9drale Engloutie\" 1975) the offer to become artistic director of NDT together with Hans Knill, was extented to him.\nThe creation of \"Sinfonietta\", to music of Kylian\u00b4s co-patriot Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek for the \"Charleston Festival\" in the USA in 1978 led to international recognition of the company. Subsequently many important international tours of NDT have taken place incl. Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Paris Opera etc.\nDuring Kyli\u00e1ns engagement in NDT (1975-2009), he has created more than 75 choreographies for the company. Further pieces he made for other worldwide companies, such as the Stuttgart Ballet, the Op\u00e9ra de Paris, the Munich Bayerisches Staatsballett, and the Tokyo Ballet.\nRealizing the importance of education of young dancers, Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n and Carel Birnie, the managing director of NDT, have decided in 1978 to create a new company - NDT II, in which young people would get the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. After many years of directorship, Kyli\u00e1n saw the departure of many fine and interesting performers. It was in 1991 that he decided to create a small group for dancers, who find themselves in the precarious age between \"forty and death\". The world premiere of this \u201cSenior Company\u201d was created by choreographers: Hans van Manen, Mats Ek, William Forsythe and Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n. The original dancers were: Sabine Kupferberg, Alida Chase, G\u00e9rard Lemaitre and Niklas Ek. The importance of this new development in dance was instantly recognized by the public as well as by the media.\nThis unique, three-dimensional structure, NDT I \u2013 mature dancers, NDT II \u2013 young dancers, NDT III \u2013 senior dancers, residing in its own theater, designed and built by architect Rem Koolhaas in 1987, placed NDT in a totally new category. It has become different from any other dance company in the world, and was recognized as such by being given various prestigious awards.\nFurther activities.\nIn the recent years Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s creativity is focused on film, video and photography. The films \u201cCarmen\u201d, \u201cSchwarzfahrer\u201d, \u201cBetween Entrance and Exit\u201d, \u201cScalamare\u201d and the photo installation \u201cFree fall\u201d were all created in collaboration with his lifelong partner and muse Sabine Kupferberg.\nIn 1988 Kyli\u00e1n established the Kylian Foundation in The Hague (originally named as \u201cKyli\u00e1n Choreographic Archive\u201d). In 2008 the Kylian Production BV was set up in the Netherlands and in 2017 Kyli\u00e1n Fund Prague was founded in the Czech Republic.\nSelected works (choreography).\nTheatre works from 1973 to 2019:\nSelected Awards.\nDuring his career, Kylian has received many prestigeous, international awards and honours, such as:\nFilms.\nFilms from 2006 to 2017:"}

It was made by Sony Corporation, which was the parent company of Sony Pictures Entertainment. It came out in the Western market in late 1991 or early 1992. It was marketed in the United States to college students and international travelers, but was only successful in Japan. The Discman product name was first used for Sony's range of portable CD players, such as the Sony Discman D-50, which first came out in 1984.\nThe Data Discman allows information to be accessed quickly on a pre-recorded disc. This is done using a QWERTY keyboard and the \"Yes\" and \"No\" keys.\nMost Data Discman models have a small low-resolution grayscale LCD (256x200 at first, then up to 320x240 and in colour for later models), a CD drive (either Mini CD or full size), and a computer that is not very powerful. Early versions of the device cannot play audio CDs. Software is pre-recorded and mostly is encyclopedias, foreign language dictionaries and novels. Software was usually made using the Sony Electronic Book Authoring System (SEBAS).\nA DD-1EX Data Discman is in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is displayed in the V&amp;A's 20th Century Gallery. This early model cannot play sound.\nAn updated model, the DD-10EX, came out in 1992 or 1993. The manual that comes with it gives a copyright date of 1992. Unlike the DD-1EX, the DD-10EX can also play audio files. The British version comes with two discs: one with the \"Thomson Electronic Directory\" for April 1992 on it, and one with the \"Pocket Interpreter 5-language conversation book for travelers\" on it. A DD-10EX was in an exhibition called \"The Book and Beyond: Electronic Publishing and the Art of the Book\", which was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is in London, from April 1995 to October 1995. The exhibition also included a CD-ROM for the Data Discman, which is called \"The Library of the Future\", and came out in 1993.\nThe DD-1EX and DD-10EX were both in a flip or clamshell design, while the flat, rectangular design of the DD-8 was closer to later e-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle."}

It was first issued as a Sunday newspaper, on January 5, 1868. Most people in Geneva are Protestant. Le Courrier was issues by a small number of Catholics. It has always had a strong focus on Catholic values. In 1892, it became a daily newspaper. In 1907, Geneva had a separation of Church and state; at that time, the number of printed copied dropped markedly.\nUntil 1923, the newspaper was Christian and stood for conservative values. In that year Christan Levraz changed the focus to focus more on social values - The newspaper was left-wing, from then on. The Catholic Church was not too happy with the left-wing orientation of the newspaper. In 1996, the Church stopped supporting Le Courrier, because it saw the journal's attitude as too close to the Biblical teachings (that is: too evangelical). Today, the newspaper collaborates with La Libert\u00e9, another Catrholic newspaper from Fribourg. In the year 2019, 7.000-8.000 copies were printed each day.\nLe Courrier is the only newspaper printed in Geneva."}

It goes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It goes alongside, and often joins onto, California State Route 1 when going through California. Unlike most other 3 digit routes in the system which are treated as spurs of their two digit parent routes, US 101 is treated as a two digit Route with a first digit of \"10\". The reason for this was that if the west coast highway was numbered US 91, there would be no room to establish US 93, US 95, US 97, and US 99, all of which must be west of US 91. So, they decided to call the west coast highway US 101 instead. The '10' could have been underlined so that people think that this route is a two digit route rather than a spur route of US 1, the US Highway on the east coast.\nThe route starts in Los Angeles at the junction of the Interstate 5, Interstate 10, and California State Route 60. It goes west past the north side of Downtown Los Angeles towards the coast. It meets the coast near Oxnard and goes north along the coast from here. The main cities it passes through in California is Santa Maria, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Eureka, California. In San Francisco, the route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge. The main cities the route passes in Oregon is North Bend, Florence, Newport, and Astoria. These cities are small, as no large cities are on Oregon's coast. It runs near to the Interstate 5, which goes through larger cities like Salem and Portland. In Washington, the main cities it passes through is Aberdeen, Forks and Port Angeles.

{"id": "737073", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=737073", "title": "Ace Books", "text": "Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon tried other genres. Ace published its first science fiction (SF) book in 1953. This was successful, and Ace soon published more science fiction books than both mysteries and westerns. Ace became known for the \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" publishing format used for many of its early books. But, it did not invent the format. Most of the early books were published in this \"Ace Double\" format, and Ace continued to publish books in several genres, in \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" format, until 1973.\nAce, along with Ballantine Books, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years. The death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967 created problems for the publisher. That was delayed several years by the Ace Science Fiction Specials series, prominent in science fiction awards and nominations for novels published from 1968 to 1970. Two leading editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were more successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr came back as editor. Several sales of the company resulted in the company becoming part of Berkley Books. Ace later became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).\nHistory.\n1952: Ace Doubles concept.\nEditor Donald A. Wollheim was working at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included \"Ace Mystery\" and \"Ace Sports.\" Ace Books may have got its name from these magazines. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but waited for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.\nThe first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\": Keith Vining's \"Too Hot for Hell\", backed with Samuel W. Taylor's \"The Grinning Gismo,\" for 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" book has the two titles bound in opposite directions, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). Ace did not invent this format even though they are well-known for it. Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, so that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the \"Ace Double\" format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag \"Complete and Unabridged\" on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.\nSome important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features William S. Burroughs's first novel, \"Junkie\" (written under the pseudonym \"William Lee\"), and many novels by Philip K. Dick, Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Harry Whittington, and Louis L'Amour, including those written under his pseudonym \"Jim Mayo\".\nThe last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's \"Life with Lancelot\", backed with William Barton's \"Hunting on Kunderer\", issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace started using the \"Ace Double\" name again in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally, not \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\".\n1953\u20131963: Genre focus.\nAce's second title was a western (also \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\"): William Colt MacDonald's \"Bad Man's Return\", bound with J. Edward Leithead's \"Bloody Hoofs\". Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as P. G. Wodehouse's \"Quick Service\", bound with his \"The Code of the Woosters\". In 1953, A.E. van Vogt's \"The World of Null-A\", bound with his \"The Universe Maker\", appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released Theodore S. Drachman's \"Cry Plague!\", with a plot that could be regarded as SF, but the book it was bound with\u2014Leslie Edgley's \"The Judas Goat\"\u2014was not SF.) Another SF double followed later in 1953, and SF quickly became an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more SF books each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, SF titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published some juvenile delinquent novels in the 1950s. Collectors want these books, such as D-343, \"The Young Wolves\" by Edward De Roo and D-378, \"Out for Kicks\" by Wilene Shaw.\nBy the late 1950s, Ace's was publishing almost one hundred titles a year. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents. A few were 50 cents. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\", were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their example and sold books to the increasing audience for SF. But, no other publisher had as much the influence as Ace or Ballantine.\nMarket dominance was not only how many books Ace published, but also the first novels of authors such as Philip K. Dick (\"Solar Lottery\", 1955, D-103, bound with Leigh Brackett's \"The Big Jump\"); Gordon R. Dickson (\"Alien from Arcturus\", 1956, D-139, bound with Nick Boddie Williams' \"The Atom Curtain\"), Samuel R. Delany (\"The Jewels of Aptor\", 1962, F-173, bound with James White's \"Second Ending\"), Ursula K. Le Guin (\"Rocannon's World\", 1966, G-574, bound with Avram Davidson's \"The Kar-Chee Reign\"), Roger Zelazny (\"This Immortal\", 1966, F-393),\nand R. A. Lafferty's \"Past Master\" (1968, H-54).\n1964\u20131970: Financial problems.\nIn 1964, science fiction author Terry Carr joined the company. In 1967, he started the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as R. A. Lafferty, Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin. Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual \"Year's Best Science Fiction\" anthology series; and Carr also edited \"Universe\", a well-received original anthology series. \"Universe\" was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.\nIn 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a copyright loophole in the American edition of \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Houghton Mifflin edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the George Allen &amp; Unwin edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by Jack Gaughan. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by Ballantine Books (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any \"unauthorized\" versions \u2013 referring directly to the Ace editions), Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.\nWyn died in 1967, and the company grew larger than its budget. It did not pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim did not want to send signed contracts to authors. At least once, a book without a contract went to the printer. Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, had to picking fruit for a living.\n1971\u20132015: Ace becomes a subsidiary.\nBoth Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim planned to start a separate paperback house with New American Library. He set up DAW Books. Carr became a freelance editor. Both Carr and Wollheim then edited competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.\nBy the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications. It was in the Hippodrome Building, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City. In 1972, Grosset &amp; Dunlap bought Ace, and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was bought by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ace was likely the only profitable part of Grosset &amp; Dunlap by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.\nCarr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's \"Neuromancer\", Kim Stanley Robinson's \"The Wild Shore\", Lucius Shepard's \"Green Eyes\", and Michael Swanwick's \"In the Drift\". All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the SF genre. Other prominent SF publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.\nIn 1996, Penguin Group (USA) bought the Putnam Berkley Group, and kept Ace as its SF imprint. As of December 2012, recently published authors included Joe Haldeman, Charles Stross, Laurell K. Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, and Jack McDevitt. Penguin joined together with Random House in 2013 to become Penguin Random House, which continues to own Berkley. Ace's editorial team is also responsible for the Roc Books imprint, although the two imprints have a separate brand identity.\nPeople.\nThese people have worked at Ace Books as editors. The list is in order by the date they started working at Ace, if that is known. It includes editors who are notable and the most recent editors at Ace.\nAce names for series of books.\nUntil the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as \"D-31\" and \"H-77\", and numbers, such as \"10293\" and \"15697\". The letters told the price. This is a list of letter series with their dates and prices.\nThe first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" format: Keith Vining's \"Too Hot for Hell\" backed with Samuel W. Taylor's \"The Grinning Gismo\". That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's \"Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry\", but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate \"Double\" (i.e., \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\") or \"Single\"; there are D-series titles that are not \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\", although none of the \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" titles have an S serial number. Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101. The \"t\u00eate-b\u00eache\" format proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000."}

Howard Browne, the editor, was forced to switch to science fiction not fantasy. Browne lost interest in the magazine. The magazine often published poor-quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, Paul W. Fairman. At the end of the 1950s, Cele Goldsmith took over as editor of both \"Fantastic\" and \"Amazing Stories\". Goldsmith helped to support the early careers of writers such as Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin. In 1965 the magazines were sold to Sol Cohen, who hired Joseph Wrzos as editor and switched to a reprint-only policy. This was financially successful, but brought Cohen into conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. At the end of the 1960s, Ted White became editor and the reprints were stopped.\nWhite worked hard to make the magazine successful, introducing artwork from comics artistsBut, in 1978, Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White resigned soon after. Elinor Mavor was the next editor, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down \"Fantastic\".

It was located along the Akera River, on the southeastern section of the modern border of Armenia and Azerbaijan(approximately corresponds to the Kashatag region of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). The residence of the Meliks was located in the village of Khnats, in the east of the present Syunik region of Armenia.\nHistory.\nMelikdom was founded in the last quarter of the 15th century. Melik Haykaz I, the founder of the Melik-Haykazyan dynasty, the youngest branch of the Armenian princely dynasty of Proshyan, became its founder. Prior to the Aikazyan, the Kashatag region was ruled by the clan of Shahurnetsi and before them by the Orbelian family.\nAikaz I was succeeded by a son, Ahnazar I. Ahnazar died in 1551, his grave survived until the 1930s. The palace of Akhnazar in Khnatsakh has survived to this day.\nThe most prominent representative of the genus was Melik Aikaz II, who owned Melik rights from 1551 to 1623 and was an active supporter of the Iranian orientation during the Turkish-Persian wars for the possession of Transcaucasia. Arakel of Tabriz mentions him as one of the noble Armenians and advisers at the court of Shah of Iran Abbas I.\nAccording to historian M. Asratyan, due to the brutal policies of the Ottoman Empire during the temporary occupation of Transcaucasia, in the 1580s or 90s, Aykaz II left his possessions and lived in exile in Iran for 10-15 years. After the reconquest of the region by Iran and the crowding out of Turkish troops, in 1606-1607, as one of the loyal supporters of the Shah, Aykaz II was not only restored to his rights to Kashatag but also received some possessions beyond its borders.\nWe have reached the decree(ferman) of Shah Abbas I with a listing of the services provided by Melik for Shah authorities. The decree(ferman) himself has no date, but the date 999 of the hijra (that is, 1590/1591) is indicated on the seal of Abbas I.\nThe names of Aikaz I, Ahnazar I, Aikaz II and their descendants are found in tombstones preserved on gravestones of the 16th \u2013 18th centuries.\nOn behalf of Melikdom of Kashatag, which were belonged to the Aykazyan family, a document written in Persian in 1691-92 was preserved. It includes the joint appeal of Melik Akhnazar and his subordinate village headmen(in Armenian \"tanuter\", in Persian \"kedhuda\"), addressed to the Shah\u2019s court. In the document, they appoint as their authorized representatives the son of melik Akhnazar, Ilyas (Elias), and one of the elders, Hikor, who were supposed to present the problems arising in the region to the Shah\u2019s court and defend the interests of the local population.\nThe names of Melik Ahnazar and his brother Aikaz (who is also mentioned in the document of 1691/92 as one of the witnesses) are marked in the inscription of 1682 on the facade of the entrance to the Church of the Holy Virgin in the village of Mirik of the Kashatag region."}
