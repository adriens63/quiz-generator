About a third of the people are indigenous, mostly Buru, but also Lisela, Ambelau and Kayeli people. Between 1658 and 1942, Buru was colonised by the Dutch East India Company and then by the Crown of the Netherlands. The Japanese army had the island between 1942 and 1945. In 1950, it became part of independent Indonesia. During president Suharto's New Order administration in the 1960s\u20131970s, Buru was a prison for thousands of political prisoners. The famous Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer wrote most of his novels, including \"Buru Quartet\" in that prison.\nGeography and geology.\nBuru island is between two seas of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 Seram Sea () on the north and Banda Sea () to the south and west. To the east, is the Manipa Strait () then Seram Island (). The area of Buru is . Buru is the third largest Maluku Islands.\nBuru is shaped like an oval. It is about from east to west and from north to south. The highest point on the island () is the peak of Mount Kapalatmada. The island is mostly mountainous, especially in the central and western parts. Much of the island is covered with tropical rain forest.\nPlants and animals.\nBuru is between Australia and Asia. Its plants and animals are unique.\nAdministrative division.\nThe island belongs to the Indonesian province of Maluku (). It is split into Buru Regency () and South Buru Regency ().\nPopulation.\nAs of the 2010 Census, the population of the islands administered as Buru was 161,828 people; at the 2015 Intermediate Census this rose to 186,779. About 68.3% in the northern regency and 31.7% in the southern;\nHistory.\nPrecolonial period.\nOne of the first mentions of Buru is in the Nagarakretagama in 1365. That is an Old Javanese funeral speech for Hayam Wuruk, the ruler of the Majapahit Kingdom.\nIn the 16th\u201317th centuries Buru was claimed by the rulers of Ternate island and by the Portuguese. But neither nation controlled the island. They only visited it for trade. Makassar people from Sulawesi island built fortifications on Buru. The Makassars forced the locals to grow valuable spices, such as clove.\nColonial period.\nThe Makassars and Dutch East India Company both wanted the spices in the east of the Malay archipelago. They fought a war. In 1648, the Dutch forced the Makassar out of Buru. The Dutch destroyed farms and buildings because they could not stay on Buru and afraid that the Makassars might come back. They came back with with four cannon and staffed by 24 soldiers in 1658 at the southern coast of Kayeli Bay. They built a permanent settlement and fortress. The Dutch forced about 2,000 local island people to move to Kayeli Bay. Many of them were nobles. The Dutch wanted to control the local people and make them work in the clove fields. These local Kayeli people became important leaders.\nThe Dutch East India Company ended in the early 18th century. All its land in the Malay archipelago became property of the Dutch crown. Buru was divided into regencies. Local rulers called rajascontrolled the regencies for the Dutch. All rajas were Kayeli tribal nobles.\nThe demise of Kayeli dominance began in the 1880s, when the leaders of Leliali, Wae Sama and Fogi clans moved significant parts of their ethnic groups to their original settlements; they were joined in the early 1900s by Tagalisa. By then, many other of the original 13 Kayeli villages were either abandoned or had lost their rajas. By about 1910, the leading role of the Kayeli clan had almost disappeared.\nTransition years 1942\u20131950.\nFrom the spring of 1942 to the summer of 1945, the Japanese army controlled all of the Dutch East Indies, including Buru. The island was bombed by the Allies planes. They were attacking the Namlea Airport.\nAfter Japan lost the war, control of the island went back to the Netherlands. In December 1946, Buru, along with the other Maluku Islands, Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda Islands, was included in a partly independent State of East Indonesia. It was set up by the Dutch government. They planned to let their East Indies slowly become a dependent state. In December 1949, eastern Indonesia joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.\nIn April 1950, Buru, Ambon, Seram and some smaller nearby islands started an independent Republic of South Moluccas. They promised to keep close political ties with the Netherlands. The Republic of Indonesia tried to absorb the RMS by talking. But, this failed. So, the Republic of Indonesia started a six-month war in July 1950. In December 1950, the Republic of Indonesia controlled Buru and it became part of the Republic of Indonesia.\nAs part of Indonesia.\nBetween 1950 and 1965, the new government wanted to make Buru part of Indonesia. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military regime of General Suharto, Buru became a main prison. Most prisoners were Communists and other left-wing representatives, and intellectuals. Most camps on Buru were closed in 1980. More than 12,000 people had been prisoners. At least several hundred had died or been killed.\nOne of the prisoners was an Indonesian writer, Pramoedya Ananta Toer. He was in prison for 14 years (1965\u20131979). He wrote there many of his novels, including most of \"Buru Quartet\". Until 1975, Toer was not allowed pencil or paper. He memorized his novels and told them to his cellmates. They helped him to remember the stories.\nTransportation.\nBuru is linked with other parts of Indonesia by sea. It has two main ports in Namlea and Namrole. The military airfield at Namlea (runway 750 meters) is used for air transportation. Most local transportation is on roads.\nTraditional work and culture.\nTraditionally, work and culture in villages changed with seasons and people moved to follow work. and food. Men hunted wild pigs called Buru babirusa, deer, and possum. Women gathered wild vegetables. During the west monsoon (November to April) both men and women worked together in the fields. The soil on the island was not good, so sometimes villages moved to newer, better soil. Sometimes people would move their whole village after some 20 years of using one piece of land. Most settlements were small. \nTraditional Buru clothes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarongs and a long-skirted tunic. Women also wear sarongs but a shorter jacket. Color of clothes is different for the different tribes of the island.\nResearch.\nBoth Indonesian and foreign scientists study the special plant and animal life on the island. But, the original plants on the coast and much of the mountain forest have been cut or destroyed for farming. Only two large areas rain forest are still in the mountains. These are protected areas called Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380\u00a0km2) and Waeapo (50\u00a0km2)."}

It is on Spitfire Island, a roundabout at the intersection of the Chester Road and the A47 Fort Parkway at the entrance to the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham.\nIt is near Junction 5 of the M6 motorway and the Jaguar car factory. This used to be the Castle Bromwich aircraft factory. It shows three Spitfires peeling off up into the air in different directions. The half-scale Spitfires are made of aluminium, with curving steel supporting beams which act as vapour trails. It captures the dynamics of the Spitfire in flight and commemorates the nearby Castle Bromwich factory where most of Britain's wartime Spitfires were built.\nHistory.\nThe project began in 1997. The project has won awards. The project was part of the regeneration of the Castle Vale estate. It was funded by the National Lottery. Tolkien was appointed as artist in residence. He consulted local residents about an art feature. They liked the area's links to World War II aircraft. They would like a sculpture with Spitfires. The sculpture was opened on 14 November 2000. The sculptor is the great-nephew of J. R. R. Tolkien who was the author of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and who grew up in Birmingham.\nThe main commercial sponsors of the spitfire sculpture were from Jaguar, Rubery Owen Holdings and Cincinnati. Both Cincinnati and Rubery Owen Holdings made parts for the Spitfires. They were put together at the Castle Bromwich Spitfire and Avro Lancaster bomber factory. This is the factory where Jaguar cars are now made. \nThe Castle Bromwich Aerodrome Factory was built in 1940 to produce planes for the war effort. About 12,000 Spitfires were made there from 1940 to 1945. Over 37,000 test flights were made from Castle Bromwich Aerodrome. The completed planes were towed across the road from the factory to the Aerodrome. The sculpture was unveiled by Alex Henshaw. He was the Chief Test Pilot for spitfires.\nThe aerodrome site is now the Castle Vale estate."}

{"id": "724905", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=724905", "title": "North Sulawesi", "text": "North Sulawesi () is a province of Indonesia. It is on the northeastern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi. This is called the Minahasa Peninsula. The province is south of the Philippines and southeast of Sabah, Malaysia. The Maluku Sea is to the east, the Gorontalo and Celebes Sea is to the west, and the Gulf of Tomini is to the southwest. The province's area is 13851.64 sq.km, and its population was 2,270,596 at the 2010 census; \nThe province's capital, business center, and largest city is Manado. Other major towns are Tomohon and Bitung. There are many tall mountains from high. The province is a young volcanic region. There are many eruptions and active volcanic cones.\nIn the past, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and the Kingdoms around this area fought over the riches in North Sulawesi such as spices, rice and gold. The region was also the trading route between west and east and this helped the spread of Christianity, Islam, and other religions. The Portuguese first landed in the 16th century. The Spanish and the Dutch came and the Portuguese fought them. Finally, the Dutch got control in the 17th century. The Dutch ruled the area for three centuries until the Japanese came at the start of World War II. After the Japanese lost WWII in 1945, the Dutch controlled the area again for a short time. They left in 1949. , following the Round Table Conference, in which the Dutch recognized the newly created United States of Indonesia (RIS). So, North Sulawesi became part of the territory of the State of East Indonesia (NIT). The people did not like NIT, so it became part of the Republic of Indonesia in 1950. At first, the island of Sulawesi was one single province. Soon it separated into several different provinces. So, the province of North Sulawesi started on 14 August 1959.\nName.\nThe area around North Sulawesi used to be called Minahasa. The name is still used sometimes. The word Minahasa comes from the words Mina-Esa (Minaesa) or Maesa which means being one or uniting This name shows hope to unite the ethnic groups of the area including the: Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tolour (Tondano), Tonsawang, Ponosakan, Pasan, and Bantik. The word \"Minahasa\" was first used by J.D. Schierstein, the Dutch regent of Manado, in his report to the Governor of Maluku on 8 October 1789.\nHistory.\nPre-historic.\nArchaeological research has revealed signs of human life in North Sulawesi since 30,000 years ago, based on evidence in the cave Liang Sarru on the island of Salibabu. Other evidence shows life about 6,000 years ago on the Passo Hillside Site in Kakas District and 4,000 years ago to early AD at the Liang Tuo Mane'e cave in Arangkaa on Karakelang Island.\nColonial Period.\nAt the end of the 16th century, Portuguese and Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. The Portugal was the first western nation to arrive in North Sulawesi. A Portuguese ship landed at Manado The Sultanate of Maguindanao controlled the northern islands at that time. The Portuguese built the fort at Amurang.\nThe Spanish ship docked on the island of Talaud and Siau, on to Ternate. Spain built the Fort in Manado, since then Minahasa started in control of Spain. The resistance against the Spanish occupation culminated in 1660\u20131664. \nThe Dutch ship landed in Manado City in 1660 in assisting the struggle of the Minahasa Confederation against Spain. The United Nations republican association of members of the Minahasa Confederation entered into a Trade Agreement with the VOC. This trade cooperation agreement then made the VOC monopolize the trade, which gradually began to impose its will, eventually leading to the 1700s resistance in Ratahan which culminated in the Dutch Minahasa-War in 1809\u20131811 at Tondano.\nThe Spanish had already colonized the Philippine Islands. They made Minahasa a coffee plantation. Spain made Manado a center of coffee trade for Chinese merchants. Some Minahasan tribes helped Spain capture the Portuguese fort at Amurang in the 1550s. The Spanish colonists then built the fort in Manado. Finally, Spain controlled all Minahasa. \nIn the 16th century one of the first Indo-Eurasian communities in the archipelago was in Manado. The first king of Manado was Muntu Untu (1630). He was half Spanish ancestry. Spain later gave Minahasa to the Portuguese in exchange for 350,000 ducats in a treaty. The rulers of Minahasa sent Supit, Pa'at, and Lontoh to fight with the Dutch to force the Portuguese out of Minahasa. They succeeded in 1655. They built their own fortress in 1658 and forced out the last Portuguese a few years later.\nBy the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch had overthrown the sultanate of Ternate. They began to reduce the power of Spain and Portugal in the archipelago. In 1677 the Dutch conquered the Sangir archipelago. Two years later, Robert Padtbrugge, the governor of Maluku, visited Manado. He made an agreement with the Minahasan chiefs. This let the Dutch dominate for the next 300 years. However, direct rule by the Dutch only began in 1870. The Dutch helped unite the Minahasa confederation. In 1693 the Minahnians won a military victory against the Mongondow tribe in the south. Dutch influence increased and Christianity and European culture grew in Minahasa. The missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were one of the first attempts of mass education in Indonesia. Graduates of the schools could find work as civil servants, in the army, and in the Dutch East Indies government. Minahasa relations with the Dutch were often poor. There was a war between the Dutch and Tondano in 1807 and 1809. The Minahasa territory was not under Dutch direct rule until 1870. But eventually the Dutch and Minahasa became very close. So, Minahasa was often called the 12th Dutch province. Even in 1947, Manado formed the political movement of Twapro, short for Twaalfde Profincie (Twelfth Province) who wanted formal integration of Minahasa into the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nIndependence.\nThe Japanese occupied the area from 1942 to 1945. was a period of deprivation, and the allied forces bombed Manado greatly in 1945. During the period of independence thereafter, there was a split between pro-Indonesian and pro-Dutch Minahasa. The appointment of Sam Ratulangi as the first East Indonesia governor then succeeded in winning Minahasa support to the Republic of Indonesia. After Indonesian independence, Indonesia is divided into 8 Provinces, and Sulawesi is one of these provinces. Sulawesi's first governor was S.G.J.Ratulangi, also known as a national hero. In 1948 in Sulawesi was formed the State of East Indonesia, which later became one of the states within the United States of Indonesia. The State of East Indonesia was dissolved, and merged into the Republic of Indonesia. Based on Law Number 13 Year 1964, formed North Sulawesi Province. 14 August 1959 was designated as the anniversary of the province.\nIn March 1957, North and South Sulawesi military leaders demanded more freedom from Java. They wanted more active development, sharing tax money fairly, and help against Kahar Muzakar's rebellion in South Sulawesi. They wanted a central government led by both Sukarno and Hatta equally. At first the movement of the 'Permesta' (Charter of the Struggle of the Universe) was merely a movement of reform rather than a separatist movement.\nNegotiations between the central government and Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in South Sulawesi, but Minahasan leaders were not satisfied with the outcome of the agreement and the movement broke out. Fearful of southern dominance, Minahasan leaders declared their own North Sulawesi autonomous state in June 1957. At that time the central government had controlled South Sulawesi, but in the North there were no strong figures of the central government and there were rumors that the United States was armed with rebellion in Sumatra North, also has links with Minahasan leaders.\nThe possibility of foreign intervention prompted the central government to request military assistance from southern Sulawesi. The Permesta forces were later removed from Central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangir, and Morotai in Maluku. Permesta planes (supplied by the US and flown by Philippine, Taiwanese, and American Pilots) were destroyed. The US then moved on, and in June 1958 the central government army landed in Minahasa. The Permesta uprising ended in mid-1961.\nThe Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions failed. They even helped to create what they did not want as the center reacted to the threat of rebellion. The central government authority increased while regional autonomy became weaker. Radical nationalism became stronger. Communist party power and Sukarno's power increased while Hatta weakened. Sukarno finally established guided democracy in 1958. \nSince the 1998 reforms, the Indonesian government has begun to adopt laws that enhance regional autonomy, the main idea that Permesta fights for.\nEnvironment.\nClimate.\nThe climate of North Sulawesi is tropical with muzon winds. The West winds bring rain to the north coast from November to April. It changes to a dry south wind from May to October. Annual rainfall is from 2000 to 3000\u00a0mm. There are about 90\u2013140 rainy days. Temperatures average 25 degrees Celsius. The average maximum air temperature was recorded at 30 degrees Celsius and the minimum average air temperature was 22.1 degrees Celsius.\nGeography.\nThe province of North Sulawesi is in the northern peninsula of Sulawesi Island. It is one of three provinces in Indonesia in important places on the Pacific Rim. The other two provinces are North Sumatra and Aceh Special Region. North Sulawesi is near the equator at 0.30\u20134.30 North Latitude (Lu) and 121\u2013127 East Longitude (BT). The peninsula stretches from east to west. The Sangihe and Talaud Islands are the parts of the province farthest north. These are North Sulawesi's boundaries:\nMost of mainland North Sulawesi Province is mountains and hills with valleys in between. Some mountains in North Sulawesi are Mount Klabat (1,895 m) in North Minahasa, Mount Lokon (1,579 m), Mount Mahawu (1,331 m) in Tomohon, Mount Soputan (1,789 m) in Southeast Minahasa, Mount Dua Saudara (1,468 m) in Bitung, Mount Awu (1,784), Mount Space (1,245 m), Mount Karangketang (1,320 m), Mount Dalage (1,165 m), in Sangihe and Talaud, Mount Ambang (1,689 m), Mount Gambula (1954 m) and Mount Batu Balawan (1,970 m).\nThe two largest lakes are: Lake Tondano (area of 4,278 ha) in Minahasa and Lake Moat (area 617 ha) in East Bolaang Mongondow. The main rivers are Tondano River (40\u00a0km), Poigar River (54.2\u00a0km), Ranoyapo River (51.9\u00a0km), Talawaan River (34.8\u00a0km) in Minahasa. Dumoga River (87.2\u00a0km), Sangkub River (53.6\u00a0km), and Ongkaw River (42.1\u00a0km) are in Bolmong and Bolmut.\nAlong the coast of North Sulawesi, both on the mainland coast and on the coast of the islands, there are several headlands and bays. The soil in the area was fertile for agriculture.\nPlants and Animals.\nMost of the plants and animals in North Sulawesi are like those in other parts of Indonesia. But, there are some animals in the province such as Deer, Maleo, Taong, Mini Tarsius Spectrum in Bitung City Nature Reserve And Coelacanth off the coast of Manado. \nIn the sea off North Sulawesi, there are several species of fish, coral, and plankton. Some marine fish are important sources of foreign exchange, including: tuna, skipjack, yellow tail, lobster, and others. \nMuch of North Sulawesi is forest. Forests start at sea level and may continue to mountain tops. Good quality timber, including ebony (wooden) iron wood, linggua, cempaka, wooden nantu, gopasa, and meranti. There are also plantation crops such as coconut, nutmeg, and cloves.\nPeople.\nNorth Sulawesi counted 2,270,596 people in the 2010 Census. The population was 1.41% higher than ten years before. The largest ethnic groups are the Minahasan in the north of the province and the Mongondow to the south. The province's main city is Manado (population of 432,300 in 2019). In 2010, about 68% were Christian. Christians in North Sulawesi are mostly Protestant but there are also some Catholics. This is unusual in mostly Muslim Indonesia. Dutch missionaries were very successful during the colonial time. Also, because the Muslim-majority region of Gorontalo left North Sulawesi to become the new Gorontalo (province) in 2000. Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist minorities also live in the province. Manado also has a significant Judaism community. Currently, the only synagogue in Indonesia is in Manado. There are an estimated 800 Jewish people in Manado. \nEthnic groups.\nMany groups of people live together in this province. The largest group of people are the Minahasa people. They mostly lived in Bitung City, Manado City, Tomohon City, Minahasa Regency, North Minahasa Regency, South Minahasa Regency and Southeast Minahasa Regency. Other ethnic groups are the Bolaang Mongondow, Sangihe, Talaud and Siau. Ethnicity in North Sulawesi is more heterogeneous then other parts of Indonesia. The Minahasan and Bolaang Mongondow are spread almost throughout the region of North Sulawesi mainland. The Sangihe, Talaud and Siau mostly inhabit the Sangihe Islands, Talaud Island, and Lembeh Island, especially in coastal areas north, east and west of mainland North Sulawesi. The Bajau people are seafaring nomads who has migrated from the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines, due to the conflict in Mindanao. They live in coastal villages of North Sulawesi in the northern part of North Minahasa Regency.\nIn addition to the natives, North Sulawesi is also home to migrants. There are a significant Chinese population in North Sulawesi, especially around the city of Manado. The Chinese are also one of the first people to have contact with the local people before the European came. According to the discovery of Chinese ancient letters in the Tompaso area, Minahasa shows the cultural interaction between the Chinese and Minahasa have existed since the Han dynasty. Most of the Chinese people in North Sulawesi are Hakka, but some Hokkien and Cantonese people also live there.\nOther ethnic groups such as the Javanese and the Sundanese also exist. They are mostly migrated from where they come from due to the Transmigration program enacted by the Dutch during the colonial era until the Suharto era. They generally live in urban areas, such as Manado and Tomohon.\nLanguage.\nNorth Sulawesi is a multilingual culture. Many languages are used and people usually speak at least two and often more languages. Indonesian is the official language of the province an other parts of Indonesia. Official documents from the provincial government and road signs are all written in Indonesian. However, most people in the province communicate everyday in Manado Malay. This language is like Indonesian but not the same. Minahasan people speak Minahasan languages. These are the five Minahasan languages in the area: Tonsawang, Tontemboan, Toulour, Tonsea and Tombulu. To the south, people speak Mongondow language and Gorontalo language. In the north islands near the Philippines, local people speak Visayan languages.\nOther language in North Sulawesi are Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese. People from other parts of Indonesia speak these languages. Hakka is also spoken by some Chinese people in Manadao. Hokkien and Cantonese are also spoken. English and Mandarin are often understood where there are many tourists, such as the Bunaken National Park. Older people may understand Dutch and Portuguese. People who lived in islands near the Philippines may understand Tagalog.\nAdministrative divisions.\nNorth Sulawesi has eleven regencies () and four independent cities (). They are listed below."}

Evans-Pritchard", "text": "Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, Kt FBA FRAI (21 September 1902 \u2013 11 September 1973) was a British social anthropologist and ethnographer who is known for studying East African cultures and his early practice of cultural relativism.\nPersonal life.\nEarly life.\nEdward Evan Evans-Pritchard was born on September 21st, 1902 in Surrey, England. He was the son of a Reverend. He went to Winchester College in Hampshire, England. After, he went to Exeter College in Oxford for a master\u2019s degree in Modern History. In 1927, he got his PhD from the London School of Economics. Evans-Pritchard married Ioma Nicholls in 1939 and the two of them had three sons and two daughters.\nEducation.\nWhile at the London School of Economics, Evans-Pritchard was taught by the well-known C.G. Seligman and B. Malinowski and influenced by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown all of whom were important anthropologists. Evans-Pritchard, unlike his teachers, saw anthropology as less of a natural science and more about understanding culture and explaining history. Evans-Pritchard soon became known for studying the peoples of Eastern Africa. His PhD thesis was about the Azande people of modern South Sudan. He would continue to study and work with the Azande and other Eastern Africans throughout his life. He spent his time during the Second World War in Sudan and was able to study other East African peoples like the Sansui of Cyrenaica during his military service. At the time, Britain colonized many parts of Africa; Britain used their colonies as bases and staging posts during the war.\nFieldwork and theoretical views.\nAzande.\nEvans-Pritchard\u2019s spent much of his early career studying the Azande. He had a specific interest in the Azande idea of witchcraft, which to the Azande was of great importance. Whenever something bad, that was not someone\u2019s fault, happened to a member of the Azande, they would blame witchcraft for the issue. Witchcraft was a common, everyday problem for the Azande and it was a major part of their culture. Tests and trials, often done by oracles, would decide whether accused people were witches or not. It is important to note that the Azande did not always believe witch charges and they often challenged rulings. As Evans-Pritchard found, Azande witchcraft was not an excuse for someone making a mistake. The Azande idea of witchcraft had a logic to it.\nNuer.\nThe Nuer people of people of East Africa were also studied by Evans-Pritchard. Like with the Azande, he took firsthand accounts of what he saw. He did not apply the views he had of other African cultures to the Nuer without first experiencing them. He explained in detail how the Nuer thought about laws, politics, and their society. The Nuer did not build courthouses or other political buildings, instead most rules and political beliefs were taught through oral histories and stories. The will and the expectation that you would follow these rules only existed a certain distance away from the village that made them.\nCultural Relativism.\nEvans-Pritchard is known for being an early supporter for Cultural Relativism. Cultural Relativism is the belief of not judging people's cultures as better or worse compared to your own. A culture is not good or bad, it is just different. While many of Evans-Pritchard's peers considered peoples like the Azande as primitive and lesser, Evans-Pritchard found that they were rational and orderly. He also did not believe that White Europeans were inherently better than other races and this belief can be seen in his writings.\nDeath and legacy.\nEvans-Pritchard is regarded as an important British Anthropologist and Ethnographer. He believed in the importance of fieldwork and unlike many past anthropologists, spent his time visiting and writing about the Azande and Nuer personally rather than only relying on others and writing from home. He lived among those he studied, which allowed him to gather a very excellent description of who he was living with. He was supportive of future students looking at his work and asking questions, so he tried to publish as much of his own work as he could.\nLater writers would note some flaws. Evans-Pritchard contradicted himself and has faced criticism over his translation skills. Also, some of his writings about parts of the cultures he studied, such as with the Nuer religion, have flaws. Modern critics note that most of his work was done while the people he studied were ruled under the British Empire. Which to the critics, implies his work has a possible moral problem.\nEven though he was criticized, he is thought to have been an excellent writer. Also, he is said to have been a very good ethnographer, an individual who records aspects of a culture. He is remembered as an important anthropologist.\nEdward Evan Evans-Pritchard retired in 1970 and was knighted in 1971, a great honor in his native Great Britain. He died in Oxford, England in 1973.\nBibliography.\nBurton, John W. 1992 \"An Introduction to Evans-Pritchard\". Freiburg, Schweiz University.

He is one of the most sucessful strikers in Premier league.\nVardy won the Premier League title with Leicester in 2016.\nHe has played for the England national team, but has retired from international play to protect his body from wear and tear. His club contract is by far his main source of income.\nVardy is very unusual, because he was a third division player who made it big when transferred to a Premier League club quite late in his career.\nHe started his footballing career at the age of sixteen, playing for Stockbridge Park Steels youth system. On his debut for Halifax Town in 2010, Vardy scored the winning goal against Buxton. He was their top scorer for the season, with 25 goals in 37 appearances. After leaving Halifax for Fleetwood Town, he became the season's top scorer with 31 league goals. \nIn May 2012, Vardy signed for Championship side Leicester City. In 2013-14 season, Vardy got the Leicester's player of the season award, with 16 league goals. The following season, Leicester was promoted to the Premier league. Vardy won his first Premier League Player of the Month award for the month of October in 2015 and won it again in November. \nThe sports' highlight of the year was when Leicester won the 2015-16 season of the Premier League, one season after promotion. Vardy won the Premier League Player of the Season award and was one of the four Leicester players selected in the PFA Team of the Year. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 22 February 2017. He is the only player in Premier league history to have scored goals in 11 consecutive (one after the other) matches. On 5 July, 2020, Vardy scored 2 goals against Crystal Palace to complete a century of goals in Premier League.\nInternational career.\nVardy was selected for the England squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He made his international debut for England on 7th June, coming as a substitute for Wayne Rooney against the Republic of Ireland. He scored his first goal for England against Germany on 26 March 2016. He was also selected in England's squad for the World Cup 2018.\nOn 28 August 2018, Vardy \"stepped aside\" from the England national team.

Vardy is one of three L.C. players who have been nominated for the Ballon d'Or (the others were Gordon Banks and Riyad Mahrez)."}

The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is also known as Rai Pithora ka Mahal. Located to the north-east of Qutb minar,it was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in 1198 A.D.. It is the earliest extant mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved columns and architectural members of 27 Hindu and Jaina temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance. Perhaps it was the first monument of iconoclast in India. It is in contradiction to Hasan Nizami's account of Aibak as peaceful and 'Lakh Baksh' or 'giver of lakhs' in his book Taj-ul-Masir. It is said he was generous and spent huge sums in charity.But it may also be that the monument was hurriedly built with the building material from the temple as Aibak had not established himself firmly in India at that time.\nQutb was a fanatical Muslim. When his garrison occupied Delhi under the command of Muhammed Ghori in 1192, he ordered the destruction of twenty-seven Hindu and Jain temples to furnish building materials for the construction of Delhi's first mosque. Quwwat-ul-Islam, the \"Glory of Islam,\" was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably Hindus, to assemble the structure. The Hindu stonemasons repurposed columns from the destroyed temples, but adapting them to use in a mosque proved problematic given Islam's injunction against the use of images in temples. The masons were forced to plaster over the highly sculpted Hindu columns and presumably cover them with geometric designs. However, after centuries of neglect the plaster has fallen away, revealing the original Hindu carvings.\nThe Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz, and white marble, but is probably inspired by the iron \"Pillar of the Law\" that stands on the site. Built in the Mauryan dynasty in the 6th century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years, evidence of the Mauryan's superb metallurgical skills.\nLater, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Iltutmish (A.D. 1210 - 1235) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it."}

The Adder reaches sexual maturity between 3 and 4 years of age. They can live around 15 years old in the wild. \nHistory.\nThis breed was found in the 1990s. There have only been a dozen found, one was found dead. The last was found and recorded in 2007. A group of reptile experts went looking for this hard to find snake and were only able to find two during their first day. In 2014, the Albany Adder was put on the Critically endangered species list as the most endangered reptile. This snake was a month from being extinct due to the rule of a species not being found and recorded in a ten year span. If not recorded in this time frame, it is labeled as extinct.\nHabitat &amp; Habits.\nDue to the loss of the snake's home there have been few sightings of this snake. Scientists are keeping the location of the snake a secret in order to save it. There are now rules for their lands. The snakes reside in small plants and tiny trees.

It's a process of changing wool into realistic looking animals, food and many other things.\nHistory.\nNeedle felting goes back to the 1980s. It was created by David &amp; Eleanor Stanwood. They took needles from a wool factory and used them to create tiny pieces of felt without any water or soap. The skills for needle felting were then taught to Ayala Talpai who wrote books and taught others to needle felt. Today, needle felting is still not as popular as wet felting. However, it has a strong following with people who enjoy to do arts and crafts.\nMaterials.\nFinger gloves.\nFinger gloves are small leather strips that cover the index finger and thumb in order to prevent the fingers from getting stabbed by the needles. Finger gloves are important for beginners but run the risk of damaging the needles if they are stabbed too often.\nFelting cushion.\nThe cushion is required for felting. This is used so that the felting needle doesn\u2019t get damaged. It can be made out of many materials but commonly will be found as styrofoam, sponge, and other soft materials that can be stabbed by the needle but won't damage the needle.\nFelting needle.\nFelting needles come in many different sizes. Barbs lock the wool fibers in place. Smaller needles have finer barbs and can be used for more detailed work. Larger needles have thick barbs and can create felt faster than other needle sizes. The needle size is measured in gauges ranging from 12 to 42. It is a measurement of how many needles fit in a square inch. That means the higher the gauge, the smaller the needle.\nWool.\nThe wool that is typically used for needle felting is called roving. Different kind of wool can be used for felting but roving is preferred.\nProcess.\nNeedle felting starts by placing a cushion on a flat surface. Then a small amount of wool is tightly rolled up into a small bundle. The small wool fibers are rolled into a bundle and stabbed over and over again, creating a firm texture that is called felt. Adding more wool and poking it repeatedly into the felt makes a simple shape."}

Also, no one is sure as to what region these rabbits are from.\nThe difference in does (females) and bucks (males) can be told by looking at their head. Bucks have a broader head while does' are dainty and have a dewlap, a fold of skin under their chin, used to keep kits (baby rabbits) warm.\nThe Flemish Giant rabbit has other nicknames besides \"King of Rabbits.\" The name \"Gentle Giants\" was earned because unlike the smaller domestic rabbit, Flemish Giants are known for being much more calm and gentle. They are also called the \"Universal Rabbit\" mainly for being great pets and show animals, although, it could also be because of their use as a resource for food and material.\nSize.\n\"Giant\" obviously comes from their large size. \"Flemish\" was the language spoken in the region where they were being bred. Their large size does mean a bit more of food and maintenance but these rabbits can be taken care of the same way the normal domestic sized rabbits would be taken care of.\nFur.\nTheir glossy fur is short and dense. Their coats come in seven different colors; light gray, steel gray, black, fawn, sandy, white, and blue.\nGrowth.\nMature Flemish Giants weigh 13-14\u00a0lbs on average but they can weigh up to 20\u00a0pounds, even a bit more.

The comic strip was first published in the \"LA Reader\", and ran from 1983 until 1992. The comic strip was also serialized in \"Cheval Noir\".\nEach comic strip is introduced with a small caption featuring this text:\nEach strip is visually the same. The first three panels are identical, and feature the black dog growling, tied to a post in a yard by a chain. He is between a tree on the left and one wall of a house with a window on the right. The fourth panel is the same as the previous three panels, except it is night time and a circle of light is coming from the house's window.\nA word balloon appears in one or more of the panels, showing one of the members of one of the house's unseen family, either Bill, Sylvia, Pete or Billy, Jr, is speaking. The speech is usually an aphorism or a non-sequitur. Such sayings include: \"If everything is real... then nothing is real as well.\" and \"It doesn't get any better than this.\"\nIn a short essay on Lynch's \"Rabbits\", Objectif Cinema notes:\nDavid Lynch has of course used animals within his back catalogue of work before. Dogs for instance feature in nearly every one of his movies usually as a visual prop: who could forget the scene in \"Wild at Heart\" in which our canine friend scampers away with the Bank teller's severed hand? Or the mewling pups in Mary X's living room in \"Eraserhead\"? Indeed a dog, albeit in cartoon form, took centre stage in Lynch's cartoon series for the \"LA Reader\", \"The Angriest Dog in the World\". But it is here on his website that Lynch seems to be opening up more to the wonders of nature: Bees, Coyotes and Dead Mice all have a part to play in various guises and manifestations within www.davidlynch.com, and as part of the pay-per-view series, the Rabbit has been given the starring role."}

It had an effect across all of India.\nHer body was found in Shadnagar on 28 November 2019, a day after her death. Four suspects were arrested and, according to the Cyberabad Metropolitan Police, confessed to having raped and killed the doctor. On 6 December, the police took the accused to the scene of the crime, and shot them dead, prompting accusations of extrajudicial execution and celebrations of the killings. \nThe following account is based on the police report. The victim had parked her scooter near a toll plaza, and caught the attention of two lorry drivers and their assistants. They \u200adeflated her tire, pretended to help her, and pushed her into nearby bushes, where they raped and smothered her. Then they loaded her corpse onto a lorry and dropped it on the roadside.\nThe police got evidence from CCTV cameras and from the victim's mobile phone. The accused were arrested and put in Cherlapally Central Jail for fourteen days. The Telangana Chief Minister ordered a fast-track court to try the accused for their alleged crimes. \nThe rape and murder caused outrage in several parts of the country. Protests and public demonstration against rape were organised nationwide after the incident, with the public demanding stricter laws against rape and rapists. The Minister of Home Affairs criticised the Telangana Police and stated that the government intended to amend the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to introduce laws for quicker punishment by fast-track courts.\nAll four accused were killed in by police on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, while they were in police custody. According to the police, the suspects were taken there for a reconstruction of the crime scene. Two of them allegedly snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout, all four suspects were shot dead. \nThousands of people celebrated the men's deaths. The event has no religious angle: the accused included men of both main religions."}

Each three-panel strip consists of the same clip art image (the comic has no original art) in each panel for the whole strip, with added speech balloons and/or captions to create the joke.\n\"PartiallyClips\" frequently tends to use dark humor because the picture used shows peace, which is common in public-domain clip art, but the added dialogue or captions make it instead not show peace. \"PartiallyClips\" also frequently comments on modern life and culture, especially aspects of Internet culture. No characters or plots often repeat.\nIts name is a derivation from a misinterpreted phrase that results from a mishearing of the name because \"Partially Clips\" sounds similar to \"Partial eclipse\".\nDistribution and reception.\n\"PartiallyClips\" was updated twice every week, on Sundays and Thursdays. The \"partiallyclips.com\" website stopped updating on 17 June 2015. During 2018, the PartiallyClips website went down, and remains unavailable as of August 2019.

It also has thermometers to measure how hot or cold it is in the air and water.\nScientists plan to place the FrogPhone machine in a swamp or other place where frogs live and then leave. The FrogPhone works off of two lithium batteries that are recharged by a solar panel. This way, the humans do not have to come back to change the batteries, so they do not disturb the plants or animals.\nScientists can use their cellular phones to call the FrogPhone and either listen to what is happening where the FrogPhone is at that time or make a recording to listen to later or to send to a database for other people. FrogPhone only works in places that have 3G/4G cell phone coverage, but scientists think it could be used with satellites in the future.\nInvention.\nAustralian scientists invented the FrogPhone in 2019. The team had members from the University of New South Wales at Canberra and the University of Canberra and they worked with the Australian Capital Territory, Region Frogwatch Program, and Australian National University. As of December 2019, FrogPhone has been tested but not used in the real world."}

It was released in the rest of the United States in May 2000. It was designed to appeal to teenagers by being able to send text messages two ways using radio. Over 430 \"official\" freeware games and applications were released for the Cybiko. Because it can be used to send text messages, it has a QWERTY keyboard that is used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on and a SmartMedia card reader were made for the Cybiko. The company stopped manufacturing the Cybiko after two product versions and a few years. Multiple Cybikos can communicate with each other from up to 300 metres (0.19 miles) away. Several Cybikos can be used for chatting with each other in a wireless chatroom. Over 500,000 Cybiko Classics were sold by the end of 2000.\nModels.\nCybiko Classic.\nThere are two models of the Cybiko Classic. The only difference that can be seen between the two models is the original version has a power switch on the side, and the later version uses the \"escape\" key for power management. Internally, the differences between the two models are in the internal memory, and where the firmware is.\nThe CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2241 running at 11.0592 MHz. The Cybiko Classic also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. It comes with 512KB of ROM flash storage and 256KB of RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back.\nThe Cybiko Classic came in five colors: blue, purple, neon green, white, and black. The black version has a yellow keypad, instead of the white unit the other Cybikos have.\nThe add-on slot has the same pin arrangement as a PC card, but it is not electrically compatible.\nCybiko Xtreme.\nThe Cybiko Xtreme is the second-generation Cybiko handheld. It has various improvements over the original Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new operating system, a new keyboard layout, a new case design, a bigger wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output and a smaller size.\nThe CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2323 running at 18 MHz. Just as with the original version, it also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. The Cybiko Extreme comes with 512KB ROM flash storage and 1.5MB RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back, but the only hardware released that can be connected to it is an MP3 player.\nTwo variants of the Cybiko Xtreme were released. The US variant (Model No. CY44801), which has a frequency range of 902-928\u00a0MHz, and the European variant (Model No. CY44802), which has a frequency range of 868-870\u00a0MHz. There are no other functional differences between those variants.\nOptions.\n1MB Expansion Memory.\nIt is a add-on card that gives the Cybiko 1 megabyte of static RAM and 1 megabyte of flash storage. The RAM allows Cybiko programs that need more RAM to run. The flash storage allows more Cybiko programs to be stored. Some Cybiko programs will not run if the 1MB Expansion Memory is not connected to the add-on slot."}

It lives in the Western Ghat mountains in India. It is a purple cave frog that lives underground almost all the time.\nBodies.\nMany species of frog dig underground a little, but Bhupathy's purple frogs live undergound almost all the time. They have front limbs shaped like shovels for digging and long noses so they can stick their tongues aboveground and lick the surface to catch ants to eat. They do not have shoot-and-pull-back tongues like other frogs. \nAdult frogs have purple skins and a thin blue ring around each eye.\nThe frog has one close relative, the purple frog, \"N. sahyadrensis\", which was first found in the Western Ghats in 2003.\nLife cycle.\nThe tadpoles do not swim in ponds or streams. Instead, they grab the stones behind waterfalls, where they spend six months eating algae. Young frogs, called imagos, have brown skin. They turn purple when they are adults.\nAdult frogs only come aboveground when the rain falls at the beginning of the northeast monsoon season, when they find mates. \nDiscovery.\nScientists from Hyderabad's Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology discovered the frog in 2017.

The reservoir was a part of the Colorado-Big Thompson project. This project was made to move water from the west slope to the east slope. The water is used for local farms, hydropower, and drinking water for Northern Colorado. The lake is 6.5 miles long and had 25 miles of shore line with 4 camping areas, 111 campsites total, and 4 boat-launch areas. The primary activities are fishing, power boating, water skiing, hiking, and camping.\nHistory.\nThis reservoir was created on top of the town of Stout. Stout was a small town with a population of 47 1/2. This town had a sandstone mine, and had a railroad that went through it. This town turned into a gost town and horsetooth reservoir was build on top of it. To this day when the water is low enough visitors can still see the buildings where Stout used to be. Horsetooth reservoirs damn began being built in 1949. In 1954, the water was used for farms until the 1970 and then only 80 percent of the water was used for farms. In the 1990's just a little over half of the water supply was used for farms and the other half was used for drinking and hydropower. This reservoir was the largest created during the Colorado-Big Thompson project. Building was finished in 1949 and water first entered the reservoir in 1951. Horsetooth was given its name because of an Arapaho legand that on the west side of the reservoir at the top of a mountain. There is a rock that Natives thought looked like a giant's heart and then later decided that it looked more like a horse's tooth."}

Since there is no written rule about how to get out of a typhoon, Queeg tries to get out by following the rule to avoid getting into a typhoon. Since it doesn\u2019t seem to be working Maryk decides Queeg is insane and takes over as captain with Willie\u2019s help. Queeg has them put on trial for mutiny as soon as they get back to the United States. A Jewish lawyer named Lieutenant Barney Greenwald agrees to defend them because no one else will. When the trial begins, Willie realizes that the reason he helped Maryk wasn\u2019t because he thought Queeg was crazy but because he hated Queeg. He still admits to what he\u2019s done in the trial. Keefer, on the other hand, lies to the jury and says he knew nothing about the mutiny until after it happened. Greenwald still wins the trial by getting Queeg to get angry and act like he is completely crazy. Greenwald then goes to Maryk, Keefer, and Willie and tells them that they are guilty and that if there were anyone else willing to defend them he would have been the one to prosecute them. Greenwald says Queeg was actually a hero because while Willie was at Princeton and Keefer was writing his books and Greenwald was defending the Cherokee, Queeg was risking his own life to protect the country so that Greenwald\u2019s mother didn\u2019t get melted down into a bar of soap by the Nazis. Greenwald calls Keefer a coward for having convinced Maryk to mutiny and then betrayed Maryk during the trial. Greenwald then throws wine at Keefer\u2019s face and says he\u2019ll be waiting in the lobby if Keefer wants revenge and that since they are both drunk it will be a fair fight. Maryk is fired from the Navy and Keefer becomes captain. A Japanese kamikaze crashes his plane into the ship, so Keefer jumps and abandons the crew to save his own life. Willie stays on board and actually risks his own life to save everyone else and actually manages to do that. Willie then starts thinking about what is important and decides that he should marry May Wynn and have kids with her. When he comes back to America, she is using her real name and working for a soon to be divorced man who wants to have sex with her though they have not yet since she is not going to have sex with someone to whom she is not married. Willie then meets the man and he realizes that he reminds him of Keefer. Willie then knows that he can and will win her back. "}

This activity is a highlight for Alaskan residents for a chance to camp along the shore and catch enough fish for the entire year.\nHistory of Fish Nets.\nFishing nets are one of the oldest fishing gear used. They are made with all kinds of fabric like nylon, cotton, grass, flax, and tree fibers. Fish nets date back to 8500 BC in . Native Americans made their nets on the Columbia River from grass, cedar, and spruce root fibers. Dip netting started in 1989 in the Copper River, but the Alaskan board finally made it official for residents in the Spring of 1996.\nSpecies.\nHooligan, king salmon, red salmon, pink salmon, silver salmon, and flounder are fish that are mostly caught while netting. Hooligan, a Chinookan name, is also known to be called a candlefish. This is an important species to eagles, gulls, and bear. This fish is found in the Pacific Northwest of Alaska. The best way to catch them is to dip net them. There is no bag unit limit when catching these fish. Only a valid fishing license will be needed and be an official Alaskan resident. Hundreds and thousands of hooligan spawn every year in rivers. Salmon are usually born in freshwater, but slowly swim to the saltwater. They lay their eggs on the gravel and the eggs hatch after a month. These little fish are called fry because they look like long little fries when they swim in water. After they hatch, they swim to saltwater and live up to four to six years then they come back to the river, usually not the same river as they were spawned, but in a river that's not running fast. This is because hooligans are not strong swimmers.\nKing Salmon, a Chinookan salmon, is a king of all fish species because of how aggressive and large it is. It is 30-40 inches long. They are found in the Southeast of Alaska into Prince William Sound out in the Bristol Bay area. This species is highly fished because they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which makes a good dinner. Then again they are aggressive because they are strong sport fish.\nSockeye salmon, also named a red salmon, are the most popular among the salmon species because of their bright orange flesh. They are found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers. They can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh 4 to 15 pounds. They live to 3\u20137 years and are eaten by Marine mammals and bears.\nPink Salmon, known as humpy fish are found in Southeast of Alaska into Prince William Sound. Males are easily identified by their large hump on their back while females have a slimmer appearance. This area is home to seabirds that feed on them as well as bears, wolves, otters, and bald eagles. Saltwater pinks are smaller than freshwater and have softer flesh. Regular freshwater are 20-25 inches in length. They run with other fish like kings and silvers. These are especially easy to catch because they're easier to trick with the correct angler method.\nSilver salmon, deep bodied North Pacific salmon with black spots, are found in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. They grow up to be 30 inches in length and live up to 2\u20134 years.\nWays to dip net.\nThere are two types of basic dip netting: stationary and sweeping. There are two stationary techniques. Kick netting is placing a net at the bottom of the river where all of the rocks are and kicking to get fish. Just be warned that nets are easily damaged this way. The last technique is body rushing, which is using a body to catch fish. When a school of fish rush in the water, swing the body from side to side. This should scare the fish and they should get caught in the net. There are three types of sweeping. Sight dipping seeing fish in the water and trying to catch the fish. Scooping is digging between rocks blindly into bushes of weeds or large bushes. The last technique is dredging. The net rubs against the bottom of the river picking up mud, weeds and other debris that can trap fish."}

This is mainly done through the act of hugging trees to protect them from being cut. It was also known as Chipko Andolan. Those who were part of it used nonviolent protests. The Chipko movement began in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand. It then spread to Uttar Pradesh. By the 1980s it had spread across most of India.\nThe Chipko movement lead to a change in policies to stop the clear cutting of trees in some regions. (Clear cutting is a type of logging where all trees in an area are cut down).\nChipko movement was started by Sunderlal Bahuguna.\nThe name of the Chipko moment originated from the word 'embrace' as the villagers used to hug the trees and protect them from wood cutters from cutting them. In 1731, the king of Jodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for constructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest near a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. A Bishnoi woman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and daring king\u2019s men to cut her first before cutting the tree. The tree mattered much more to her than her own life. Sadly, the king\u2019s men did not heed to her pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three daughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost their lives saving trees. The incident inspired the several other rural women, who launched such similar movements in different parts of India. The Chipko Movement gained momentum under Sunderlal Bahuguna, an activist, who spent his whole life persuading and educating the villagers, to protest against the destruction of the forests and the Himalayan mountains by the government. The chipko protests achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15 years ban on tree felling in the Himalayan forests of the state by the order of Mrs. Indira Gandhi."}

It will melt and freeze over and begin to create icicles. As winter gets longer and temperatures stay in the freezing and sunlight is present, water will just melt and drip alongside the icicle causing them to get longer and sharper. The reason why icicles are pointy is because the water drips in a downward motion. Icicles can range from millimeters to feet in length.\nSnow.\nOnce temperatures reach 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), snow starts to fall. Snow will begin to build on top of each snowflake and sit on whatever surface is present. Snow is white in color and can be from the width of a single strand or hair to even inches long. Although it must be cold in order for snow to fall, it is not frozen rain, but it is a cluster of many crystals falling from the clouds.\nAccidents.\nIcicles are beautiful, but they can be very dangerous. Icicles have been reported fatal since the 1700's, from falling on people and causing accidents to property being reported. Icicles can cause damage on many structures such as buildings and homes, once ice forms layers the weight of it can cause the structure to fall or break off.

Citizen science is one kind of crowdsourcing.\nThe National Geographic Society developed the program that FrogWatch USA volunteers use to add information and that FrogWatch uses to study it. Volunteers record temperature with thermometers and listen for sounds made by specific types of frogs and toads. FrogWatch USA volunteers listen to and record frog habitats for three and a half minutes, starting one half-hour (30 minutes) after the sun goes down.\nScientists have used FrogWatch to study the way frogs and toads change the places they live, which types of frogs are becoming more numerous and which are becoming less numerous, how many different kinds of frogs live in one place, the way they react to changes in how hot or cold it is, and the way they act during different parts of the year.\nHistory.\nThe United States Geological Survey started FrogWatch USA in 1998, but the National Wildlife Federation took over in 2002.\nBetween 1998 and 2005, 1,395 people working with FrogWatch USA visited 1,942 places where frogs live and gave information to FrogWatch.

It used to be a record label of the East German state-owned music publisher VEB Deutsche Schallplatten before becoming a record label of the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994.\nIn 1947, actor and singer Ernst Busch became allowed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany to create a music publishing house, which was named Lied der Zeit GmbH (\"Song of the Times\"). This publishing company included the label Amiga. In the 1950s, Lied der Zeit became VEB Deutsche Schallplatten (\"German Records\"), a state-owned company that had a monopoly on making records. VEB Deutsche Schallplatten had multiple record labels, each for different genres; Amiga releases included folk, jazz, pop, rock, Schlager music, chanson, and children's music.\nAfter East Germany and West Germany became one country, most of the public state enterprises that were from East Germany were taken into pieces or sold to private investors. The Amiga label and catalog were obtained by Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994, which then became part of Sony Music Entertainment in 2008.\nAmiga's catalog has 2,200 albums and about 5,000 singles, or a total of 30,000 titles."}

Most cars are designed by a large group of people that usually includes artists and engineers.\nDesign process.\nTypically, cars are designed based on many sketches and drawings, along with computer-aided design models. When the design team is satisfied with the basic shape of the car, a life-size model is sculpted from clay. Details are added to the clay model, and its shape may be changed by a small amount.\nThen, the interior design team designs the car's interior, making sure that it fits the needs of the customer. These needs include things like comfort and entertainment systems. High-end cars like luxury cars and supercars have fancy interiors and are designed for an enjoyable driving experience, while utility vehicles like vans have plain, rugged interiors designed to endure various types of cargo.\nOther parts of the car, such as the chassis and engine, are designed primarily by engineers, as it is less important for these parts to look attractive than it is for them to work properly.\nHistory.\nWhile most early cars were designed around usability rather than looks, that began to change when American businessman Alfred P. Sloan came up with the idea of changing a car's styling every year. This was done from the 1920s onward to keep cars looking \"new\" for each year they were sold, leaving customers unhappy with older models of the same car and increasing car sales in the United States. Sloan got this idea from bicycle companies.\nAfter World War I, car companies in European countries focused on luxury, and companies called coachbuilders made bodies for luxury cars. Some of these bodies were customized for especially rich customers.\nAfter World War II, the American economy grew and most American citizens were now able to afford cars. Because cars became more important in the United States, so did their styling, with the most famous American car designer being Harley Earl. The influence of car design would also grow massively in Europe, especially within France, Italy, and Germany."}

It was made by Polish engineer Pawe\u0142 Zadro\u017cniak. It is made of a set of computer hardware that plays music together. The latest version, the Floppotron 2.0, has 64 floppy drives, eight hard drives, and two flatbed scanners.\nDevelopment.\nFirst version.\nThe first version of the Floppotron was made in 2011. It is made of two floppy drives and an ATMega microcontroller. The sound is made by the magnetic head being moved by its stepper motor. The floppy drive's heads have be moved at the correct speed to make the correct sound.\nThe instrument became well known thanks to a video of the instrument on YouTube playing the Imperial March, which has more than 6 million views.\n2.0 version.\nIn 2016, Pawe\u0142 Zadro\u017cniak made a better version of the Floppotron, which has 64 floppy drives, 8 hard drives, and two flatbed scanners. Every column of eight floppy drives is controlled by an ATMega16 microcontroller, and the hard drives are controlled by two SMD MOSFETs that push and pull. The flatbed scanner head are controlled by Arduino Uno boards.\nHow it works.\nAny device that has an electric motor can make sound. Scanners and floppy drives use stepper motors to move the head with sensors that scan an image, or read or write, onto a magnetic disk. The faster the motor, the higher the pitch of the sound the motor makes. Hard disks use a magnet and a coil to tilt the head. When voltage is supplied for long enough, the head speeds up and hits the bound, which makes the \"drum hit\u201d sound.\nThe Floppotron makes MIDI music files into commands that tell each device when to buzz, click, or be silent.\nSong covers.\nAs of April 2019, Pawe\u0142 Zadro\u017cniak's YouTube page shows more than one hundred songs played with the Floppotron. Some of those songs are Queen's \"Bohemian Rapsody\", Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", White Stripes's \"Seven Nation Army\", Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams\" and Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\"."}

The console was revealed in October 2018 and pre-orders started in April 2019. The console will come out on April 15, 2021, delayed from October 10, 2020, along with 40 games being made for then.\nConcept.\nMost games will be 2D or 2.5D. Other games will be 3D games the company thinks are easy to play and learn. The company helps studios make games for the console with whatever the studios need. All games will have features they will only have on the console. All games will be rated E (Everyone) or E10+ (Everyone 10+) by the ESRB, or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by PEGI. Intellivision Entertainment plan to release new games, motion control games, card games and other tabletop games, educational games, and updated classic video games, such as some Intellivision games, some from Imagic, and Atari and arcade games, of which \"Moon Patrol\" and \"BurgerTime\" will come out at about the same time as the console. Some Intellivision compilations will have licenses from third-parties, such as \"\". Games can be downloaded for $9.99 or less when the console comes out, later a higher amount less than $40, or from an RFID card for US$20 to US$30. All games can be played by one player or, because the goal of the system is to go back to family gaming and co-op with people in the same place because the company thinks modern gaming and web-based multiplayer has gone away from that, up to eight players locally. Online multiplayer is planned for a later date.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nIn May 2018, Tommy Tallarico said he planned to make a new Intellivision console, and made a new company, Intellivision Entertainment, becoming the president of it. Intellivision Productions started to name itself Blue Sky Rangers Inc. instead, and Intellivision Entertainment got the video game things they owned instead.\nAt the Portland Retro Gaming Expo in October 2018, the Intellivision Amico was officially revealed, such as its name, and the fact it would come out on October 10, 2020. Developer kits were expected to go out in Summer 2019.\nIn May 2019, Intellivision Entertainment announced its first major game exclusive to the console, a third official Earthworm Jim game, and that it got ten people who helped to work on the original \"Earthworm Jim\" team to work on it, all for Earthworm Jim's 25th anniversary. In June 2019, the Intellivision Amico could first be used in secret at E3 2019, allowing people with influence in the video game industry to play games in development on consoles, and try using the official mobile app that allowed mobile phones to be controllers for the console.\nAt Gamescom in Cologne, Germany in August 2019, Tommy Tallarico showed a trailer with footage of video games running on the Intellivision Amico to the public for the first time. In October 2019, Tommy Tallarico came to Insomnia Dubai, a gaming convention held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to say they set up an office in Dubai to make the Intellivision Amico come out in the MENA region on October 10, 2020, the same day as in North America and Europe.\nHardware.\nConsole.\nThe console has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, HDMI out, an SD card slot, and three USB ports. Two of those USB ports can be used for charging, and the remaining USB port allows the console to store more data. There is a LED ambient lighting system built into the body that can change pattern and color in response to gameplay. This system is known as Interactive Guidance Lighting. This feature is intended to make playing games on the console \"fun and memorable\" while also helping guide players in an interactive way.\nController.\nThe Intellivision Amico comes with two controllers. They can charge wirelessly when they are placed into their cradle, which is on top of the console, charge using a wired USB-C connection, or charge in both ways at the same time. They have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, speakers, a microphone, an accelerometer, force feedback and a gyroscope. They also have a full-color touch screen, four big shoulder buttons, a home button and a 64-way pressure-sensitive directional disc with a ring of LEDs all around it. The controllers come with wrist straps so they do not fly away during game action if they are not held in a secure way. Up to six more controllers can connect to the Intellivision Amico. A smartphone running a free controller smartphone app can be used instead of an Amico controller.\nGames.\nTommy Tallarico, who is the president of Intellivision Entertainment, has said the games that will be available for the Intellivision Amico will be about 20% updated and re-imagined versions of classic video games, 20% original new games, 20% sports and recreation, 20% board games, dice games, card games, word games and puzzle games, and 20% educational games. All games will be both single player and multiplayer, with some games allowing up to eight players to play the game at the same time using controllers and/or mobile phones. Some games will have motion controls, using the accelerometer and gyroscope of the controller. Some games will have the Karma Gaming Engine, a feature that is intended to give players of all skill levels a fair level of competition against each other by always changing the difficulty for players based on how well they are doing in the game. Five games will come with the Intellivision Amico, and it will have about forty more games available when it comes out. Five of the six included games have been announced to be \"Skiing\", \"Astrosmash\", \"Shark! Shark!\", \"Cornhole\", and \"Farkle\".\nThese games have been announced to come out for the Intellivision Amico:\n\"[This table is lacking citations for many of its entries]\"\nOperating system.\nThe Intellivision Amico runs an operating system that is based on Android and Linux only made by the company. In an interview with GamesBeat, Tommy Tallarico said the operating system is \"very solid\", but \"very flexible\", saying Linux is the \"flexible\" part and Android is the \"solid\" part."}

The server is running on the same map without a single reset since its creation, with its Spawn area being extremely damaged. The server has no rules, cheating and griefing are common, in addition to violence and racism in the game chat. The server became famous among the players of Minecraft thanks to its chaotic nature. According to the owner of 2b2t, as of March 2021, the server is over 10,300 gigabytes in size, and had over 600,000 players visiting at least once. The server is also a viral topic on YouTube, with videos about it reaching millions of views on that website.\nHistory.\nThe \"Minecraft\" server 2b2t.org was founded in 2010 by an unknown owner, known online as \"Hausemaster\". It was advertised on 4chan and Reddit. Members from different forums launched raids against each other and their work. YouTuber TheCampingRusher uploaded a YouTube video on June 1, 2016, where he played on 2b2t. This caused a conflict on the server known as \"The Rusher War\". A queue to enter the server was soon added due to the massive influx of new players caused by the video's popularity. Players can also pay $20 to access a separate priority queue for a month.\nSince its creation, the server gained attention from the news. Articles were created about 2b2t on \"Kotaku, Vice, IGN, Newsweek\" and \"The Independent\". In the book \"Master Builder 3.0 Advanced\", in April 2015, 2b2t was described as crazy, that it can get \"outright wild,\" and that the server is a \"nightmare wasteland.\" The book also stated that it is known as \"online royalty\" among \"Minecraft\" servers."}

Rita appears on a computer screen that is near to him to help him, but both of them run away after he chooses all of the wrong answers. Some students say to Esther, who is the person who represents the class, say they do not want as much German homework. Esther talks about the issue with their German teacher. Jessica talks about the after-school clubs (Arbeitsgemeinschaften). A montage is seen of multiple after school activities. After that, Rolli und Rita perform 'Was ist dein Lieblingsfach?'.\nEpisode 7 - \"Freizeit\".\nSome students talk about their weekend plans. Miriam talks about her horse and how she rides and cares for it. Arno is seen sleeping. At the same time, Daniel, Thomas and Esther meet in a shop that sells music. Jessica is seen doing ballet.

Jessica goes around the shops of Berlin and the KaDeWe. Thomas talks about the history of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a reminder of World War 2, and Daniel eats in a restaurant that is in Berlin. Esther talks about where she lives, Kreuzberg, and looks around its shops and restaurants. Marko talks about the history of the Berlin Wall, and talks about the plans for Potsdamer Platz to be constructed on that were new at the time. The characters say goodbye in a theme park. Rolli und Rita perform the song 'Das ist unser Berlin', which ends the series.\nRolli und Rita.\nRolli und Rita are two characters who are teenagers and are animated using computers. In every episode of the series, they appear in a sketch and perform a song.\nThe characters were said to be the most advanced ones when the series was first shown in 1996. Baxter Hobbins Slides, which was independent, used 3D motion-capture suits with motion sensors to make animated 3D models so the characters could make the same movements as the actors. These 3D models were wireframe models at first, then skin and clothes were added to them. The lip movements of the characters were done by using the real lip movements of the actors filmed behind a blue screen.\nThe voices in the sketches were later replaced with a version in French for \"Quinze Minutes Plus\" as \"Juju et Juliette\", and a version in Spanish for \"Revista\" as \"Julio y Julia\". \nThe characters (mostly Rolli) and the music videos for 'Wann Hast Du Geburtstag?' and \u2018Was Ist Dein Lieblingsfach?\u2019 later became a small meme, due to Rolli's dance movements being very big.\nRolli was voiced by Frido Ruth. Rita was voiced by Nina Hamm, except for the singing parts, which were voiced by Christina Fry, a professional actress, singer, voice-over artist, comedienne, writer, presenter and cabaretist."}

It was proprietary at first, then 3dfx later made it open source. It was only designed to draw graphics, mostly geometry and texture mapping, in data formats like those used in their cards. It was popular in the late 1990s because 3Dfx 3D accelerator cards were widely used, but became obsolete because Microsoft's Direct3D got better, full OpenGL implementations from other graphics card vendors came out, and 3D hardware became more diverse.\nAPI.\nGlide is based on the basic geometry and \"world view\" of OpenGL 1.1. That version of OpenGL is an API that has 336 calls, most of which were not of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. Glide was designed to only have the features that were of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. The allowed the API to be small enough to fully run using late-1990s hardware.\nUse in games.\nVoodoo cards mostly dominated the video game market during the last half of the 1990s because they ran fast and Glide was easy to use. The name Glide was chosen to reference OpenGL, which it was based on, while being different enough to not make trademark problems happen. \nGlide wrappers and emulators.\nGlide emulator development started in the late 1990s. Before 3dfx ended, the company tried very hard to stop these attempts, ending early emulation projects using legal threats. However, a short amount of time before it ended and Nvidia bought its assets, 3dfx made the Glide API, and also the Voodoo 2 and Voodoo 3 specifications, open source, which later became an open source project. No games released after 1999 only support Glide for 3D acceleration (Direct3D and OpenGL are used instead), but Glide emulation is still needed to run older games with hardware acceleration. Because the specifications and code are now open source, multiple emulators and wrappers are available that allow older games that use the Glide API to run on non-Voodoo hardware. Other projects, such as Glidos, allow even older games to use Glide."}

It has three modes, each providing a different experience but all sharing a fantasy setting. It is currently in Alpha, and has been in development since 2002. The game has simple text-based graphics inspired by classic roguelikes. There is no way to win, but various ways of losing an in-game fortress or adventurer. A popular meme within the game's fanbase is \"Losing is fun!\"\nGameplay.\nBefore the game can be played, a world must be generated. The player can choose the size, number of civilizations, and various other aspects of the world. After this, they are presented with a world made to their liking and can accept it or generate another.\nIn \"Fortress Mode\", the player manages a fortress of dwarves. Among other things, the player is able to construct buildings, create a military, and designate areas for mining. Their dwarves must be fed, entertained, and protected from hazards to survive. Hazards include flooding, sieges, magma, and a variety of hostile creatures.\nIn \"Adventure Mode\", the player explores the world as their own character. Through exploration, they can gather information on characters and places across the map. Quests can be discovered by listening to friendly NPCs. Most quests focus around killing villains or monsters, and reward fame. Some friendly NPCs can be made into companions, who will aid the player in their travels. The player character has the same needs as the dwarves, including hydration and rest. This mode features a deeper combat system where body parts can be targeted.\nIn \"Legends Mode\", the player can read the generated history of their world. Historical figures, artifacts, and battles are described. A historical map of the world is included.\nHistory.\nIn their youth, the Adams brothers were avid fans of sci-fi and fantasy games. They became curious about computer game development and Tarn worked to learn programming. The two programmed various computer games including \"Slaves to Armok: God of Blood\", a role-playing game focused around killing goblins. Using much of the system created for \"Armok\" and inspiration from their mining game \"Mutant Miner\", they began work on \"Dwarf Fortress\" in 2002. The game has been in development since 2006, with frequent updates on progress and planned features. The game is free to download and its development is funded through PayPal donations."}

It does not go towards a single finite value.\nInfinite means that you can always add another term. There is no final term to the series.\nIts name comes from the idea of harmonics in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are , , , etc., of the string's fundamental wavelength. Apart from the first term, every term of the series is the harmonic mean of the terms either side of it. The phrase \"harmonic mean\" also comes from music.\nHistory.\nThe fact that the harmonic series diverges was first proven in the 14th century by Nicole Oresme, but was forgotten. Proofs were given in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.\nHarmonic sequences have been used by architects. In the Baroque period architects used them in the proportions of floor plans, elevations, and in the relationships between architectural details of churches and palaces.\nDivergence.\nThere are several well-known proofs of the divergence of the harmonic series. A few of them are given below.\nComparison test.\nOne way to prove divergence is to compare the harmonic series with another divergent series, where each denominator is replaced with the next-largest power of two:\nEach term of the harmonic series is greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the second series, and therefore the sum of the harmonic series must be greater than or equal to the sum of the second series. However, the sum of the second series is infinite:\nIt follows (by the comparison test) that the sum of the harmonic series must be infinite as well. More precisely, the comparison above proves that\nfor every positive integer .\nThis proof, proposed by Nicole Oresme in around 1350, is considered to be a high point of medieval mathematics. It is still a standard proof taught in mathematics classes today.\nIntegral test.\nIt is possible to prove that the harmonic series diverges by comparing its sum with an improper integral. Consider the arrangement of rectangles shown in the figure to the right. Each rectangle is 1 unit wide and units high, so the total area of the infinite number of rectangles is the sum of the harmonic series:\nThe total area under the curve from 1 to infinity is given by a divergent improper integral:\nSince this area is entirely contained within the rectangles, the total area of the rectangles must be infinite as well. This proves that\nThe generalization of this argument is known as the integral test.\nRate of divergence.\nThe harmonic series diverges very slowly. For example, the sum of the first 1043 terms is less than 100. This is because the partial sums of the series have logarithmic growth. In particular,\nwhere is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant and which approaches 0 as goes to infinity. Leonhard Euler proved both this and also that the sum which includes only the reciprocals of primes also diverges, that is:\nPartial sums.\nThe finite partial sums of the diverging harmonic series,\nare called harmonic numbers.\nThe difference between and converges to the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. The difference between any two harmonic numbers is never an integer. No harmonic numbers are integers, except for .\nRelated series.\nAlternating harmonic series.\nThe series\nis known as the alternating harmonic series. This series converges by the alternating series test. In particular, the sum is equal to the natural logarithm of 2:\nThe alternating harmonic series, while conditionally convergent, is not absolutely convergent: if the terms in the series are systematically rearranged, in general the sum becomes different and, dependent on the rearrangement, possibly even infinite.\nThe alternating harmonic series formula is a special case of the Mercator series, the Taylor series for the natural logarithm.\nA related series can be derived from the Taylor series for the arctangent:\nThis is known as the Leibniz series.\nGeneral harmonic series.\nThe general harmonic series is of the form\nwhere and are real numbers, and is not zero or a negative integer.\nBy the limit comparison test with the harmonic series, all general harmonic series also diverge.\n-series.\nA generalization of the harmonic series is the -series (or hyperharmonic series), defined as\nfor any real number . When , the -series is the harmonic series, which diverges. Either the integral test or the Cauchy condensation test shows that the -series converges for all (in which case it is called the over-harmonic series) and diverges for all . If then the sum of the -series is , i.e., the Riemann zeta function evaluated at .\nThe problem of finding the sum for is called the Basel problem; Leonhard Euler showed it is . The value of the sum for is called Ap\u00e9ry's constant, since Roger Ap\u00e9ry proved that it is an irrational number.\nln-series.\nRelated to the -series is the ln-series, defined as\nfor any positive real number . This can be shown by the integral test to diverge for but converge for all .\n-series.\nFor any convex, real-valued function such that\nthe series\nis convergent.\nRandom harmonic series.\nThe random harmonic series\nwhere the are independent, identically distributed random variables taking the values +1 and \u22121 with equal probability , is a well-known example in probability theory for a series of random variables that converges with probability 1. The fact of this convergence is an easy consequence of either the Kolmogorov three-series theorem or of the closely related Kolmogorov maximal inequality. Byron Schmuland of the University of Alberta further examined the properties of the random harmonic series, and showed that the convergent series is a random variable with some interesting properties. In particular, the probability density function of this random variable evaluated at +2 or at \u22122 takes on the value ..., differing from by less than 10\u221242. Schmuland's paper explains why this probability is so close to, but not exactly, . The exact value of this probability is given by the infinite cosine product integral divided by .\nDepleted harmonic series.\nThe depleted harmonic series where all of the terms in which the digit 9 appears anywhere in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge and its value is less than 80. In fact, when all the terms containing any particular string of digits (in any base) are removed the series converges.\nApplications.\nThe harmonic series can be counterintuitive. This is because it is a divergent series even though the terms of the series get smaller and go towards zero. The divergence of the harmonic series is the source of some paradoxes. \nBecause the series gets arbitrarily large as becomes larger, eventually this ratio must exceed 1, which implies that the worm reaches the end of the rubber band. However, the value of at which this occurs must be extremely large: approximately , a number exceeding 1043 minutes (1037 years). Although the harmonic series does diverge, it does so very slowly.\nCalculating the sum shows that the time required to get to the speed of light is only 97\u00a0seconds."}

Crosby plays Captain Bob Wallace and Kaye plays Private First Class Phil Davis. Bob is a Broadway entertainer, Phil wants to be a professional entertainer. They perform \"White Christmas\". Their commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and says goodbye.\nAfter the performance everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing. A bomb knocks over a Wwall. Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil pushes him out of the way and injurs his arm. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks him for saving his life. Phil shows Bob a duet he wrote and asks to perform with him back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.\nAfter the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers. They mount their newest hit musical titled \"Playing Around\". The same day they receive a letter from \"Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy,\" their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.\nThey go to the club to watch the \"Sisters\" act. Phil notices that Bob likes Betty, played by Rosemary Clooney. Phil likes her sister Judy, played by Vera-Ellen. Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table. Phil dances with Judy. Phil and Judy hit it off. Bob and Betty do not get on. They have a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an \"angle\" in show business.\nJudy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord the girls have to leave. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room on the train. They delay the sheriff by imitating the girls' and sing their song, \"Sisters\". Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree.\nWhen the train arrives in Pine Tree, there isn't any snow. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge. It is failing because there's no snow and no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical \"Playing Around\". They add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals. Bob and Betty's relationship blooms and they spend a good deal of time together.\nBob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. Bob calls Ed Harrison an old army buddy. Ed is now a successful variety show host. They arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. Harrison suggests they put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis. Bob insists that it must have nothing to do with their business.\nNosy housekeeper Emma Allen has been listening, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea. She thinks that her boss will be seen as a pitiable figure on TV and tells Betty. Betty is shocked. The misunderstanding causes Betty to ignore a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer.\nAfter rehearsals are complete, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob still doesn't know the real reason Betty left. He goes to New York for \"The Ed Harrison Show\". He tries to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act and tells her the truth about the engagement. He is called away by Ed Harrison before he finds out what is really bothering her.\nBack at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement. In the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve. Betty sees it on TV and realizes she was wrong. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of \"The Old Man\". Just as the following song ends, the snow starts to fall.\nIn the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another. So do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling. Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform \"White Christmas\". Everyone raises a glass, and toasts, \"May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white.\"\nSongs.\nAll songs were written by Irving Berlin. The centerpiece of the film is the title song. This was first used in \"Holiday Inn\" where it won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1942.\n\"Count Your Blessings\" earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song.\nThe song \"Snow\" was originally written for \"Call Me Madam\" with the title \"Free\". The melody was kept but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas movie.\nThe song \"What Can You Do with a General?\" was originally written for an un-produced project called \"Stars on My Shoulders\".\nIt was not possible to issue an \"original soundtrack album\" of the film, because Decca Records controlled the soundtrack rights, but Clooney was under exclusive contract with Columbia Records. Consequently, each company issued a separate \"soundtrack recording\": Decca issuing \"Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas,\" while Columbia issued \"Irving Berlin's White Christmas.\" On the former, the song \"Sisters\" and all of Clooney's vocal parts were recorded by Peggy Lee. On the latter, the song was sung by Rosemary Clooney and her own sister, Betty.\nCrosby and Kaye recorded another Berlin song (\"Santa Claus\") for the opening WWII Christmas Eve show scene, but it was not used in the final film. Their recording of the song survives and can be found on the Bear Family Records 7-CD set called \"Come On-A My House\".\nCasting.\n\"White Christmas\" was intended to reunite Crosby and Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Crosby and Astaire had previously co-starred in \"Holiday Inn\" (1942) \u2013 where the song \"White Christmas\" first appeared \u2013 and \"Blue Skies\" (1946). Astaire declined the project after reading the script and asked to be released from his contract with Paramount. Crosby also left the project shortly thereafter, to spend more time with his sons after the death of his wife, Dixie Lee. Near the end of January 1953, Crosby returned to the project, and Donald O'Connor was signed to replace Astaire. Just before shooting was to begin, O'Connor had to drop out due to illness and was replaced by Danny Kaye, who asked for and received a salary of $200,000 and 10% of the gross. Financially, the film was a partnership between Crosby and Irving Berlin, who shared half the profits, and Paramount, which got the other half.\nA scene from the film featuring Crosby and Kaye was broadcast the year after the film's release, on Christmas Day 1955, in the final episode of the NBC TV show \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" (1950\u20131955).\nProduction.\nBerlin suggested a movie based on his song in 1948. Paramount put up the $2 million budget and only took 30% of the proceeds.\nPrincipal photography took place between September and December 1953. The film was the first to be shot using Paramount's new VistaVision process, with color by Technicolor. It was one of the first to feature the Perspecta directional sound system at limited engagements.\nRelease and reception.\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" was not impressed: \"...the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow \"White Christmas\" with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring\u2014or very little\u2014such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn't hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force.\"\n\"Variety\" liked it: \"\"White Christmas\" should be a natural at the box office, introducing as it does Paramount's new VistaVision system with such a hot combination as Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and an Irving Berlin score...Crosby and Kaye, along with VV, keep the entertainment going in this fancifully staged Robert Emmett Dolan production, clicking so well the teaming should call for a repeat...Certainly he \"(Crosby)\" has never had a more facile partner than Kaye against whom to bounce his misleading nonchalance.\"\n\"White Christmas\" was enormously popular with audiences, earning $12 million in theatrical rentals \u2013 equal to $ today \u2013 making it the top moneymaker of 1954 by a wide margin and the highest-grossing musical film of all-time. Overall, the film grossed $30 million at the domestic box office.\nThere was a US theatrical re-release by Paramount in 1961.\nHome video.\n\"White Christmas\" was released in the US on VHS in 1986 and again in 1997. The first US DVD release was in 2000. It was re-released in 2009, with a Blu-ray in 2010. There was a US issue 4-disc \"Diamond Anniversary Edition\" in 2014. This collection contains a Blu-ray with extras, two DVDs with the film and extras, and a fourth disc of Christmas songs on CD. These songs are performed individually by Crosby, Clooney, and Kaye.\nStage adaptation.\nA stage adaptation of the musical, titled \"Irving Berlin's White Christmas\" premiered in San Francisco in 2004 and has played in various venues in the US, such as Boston, Buffalo, Los Angeles, Detroit and Louisville.\nThe musical played a limited engagement on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre, from November 14, 2008 until January 4, 2009. The musical also toured the United Kingdom in 2006 - 2008. It headed to the Sunderland Empire in Sunderland from November 2010 to January 2011 after a successful earlier run in Manchester and has continued in various cities with a London West End run at the end of 2014."}

{"id": "728200", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728200", "title": "Yummy (song)", "text": "\"Yummy\" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album. The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years. Upon release, the song has received mostly mixed reception from critics \u2013 many praised its R&amp;B production but most dismissed its lyrics. Its official music video was directed by Bardia Zeinali and premiered on January 4, 2020. It portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant.\nBackground and promotion.\nOn December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption \"tomorrow\". On the following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering \"all different stories\". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like \"this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life\".\nComposition.\n\"Yummy\" is a \"straightforward R&amp;B number\" that moves along on pop-trap beats. The song contains a \"crisp bass line and plinking keyboards\". Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his \"signature falsetto\" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of \"Forbes\" magazine called the chorus \"seductive\", albeit \"meaningless\". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.\nCritical reception.\n\"Yummy\" received polarizing reviews from music critics, who complimented the \"catchy\" R&amp;B production, but criticized the \"asinine\" lyrical content. \nRania Aniftos of \"Billboard\" magazine said \"Yummy\" brings back \"the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for\", describing the chorus as \"catchy\". Bryan Rolli, writing for \"Forbes\", said that Bieber \"sings his heart out\" on the song and noted although \"the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them\". Rolli concluded calling the song a \"win, an inevitable chart smash\" and opined that it is \"sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour\". Mikael Wood of \"Los Angeles Times\" described the song as \"a lithe little R&amp;B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin\". He stated that \"though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does\" and added that the song \"loses much of its flavor after only a few spins\".\n\"NME\"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&amp;B production, but dismissed the lyrics, which he termed as \"failed expectations\". He opined that the song's producers opted for \"minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'\". Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are \"able to glide along rather effortlessly\u2014it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them\" and that Bieber's embrace of R&amp;B \"isn't a complete turn-off\". \"Pitchfork\"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being \"shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok\" and \"a bloodless shell of an R&amp;B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop\". He further wrote that the song \"plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus\". Brad Callas of \"Complex\" magazine listed \"Yummy\" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's \"pivot back to R&amp;B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project,\u00a0\"Journals\"\". Callas further remarked that the \"silky vocals\" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, \"Deja Vu\".\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Yummy\" was directed by Bardia Zeinali and premiered on January 4, 2020. In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits adapted from Tidal."}

It refers to the number of images, called frames, that are being shown every second. It is measured in frames per second, or FPS.\nEarly silent movies were shown at a frame rate between 16 and 24 frames per second. This went up to 20 and 26 FPS later. When movies with sound came out 24 FPS became the standard because it was in the middle of the frame rates theaters used.\nVideo games are usually played at a frame rate of 60 frames per second. This is because it is a very common refresh rate (display speed) for computer monitors. They also can run at 30 FPS, or even more, such as 144 FPS or 240 FPS, depending on what the monitor can handle. If the frame rate is higher than the refresh rate, not all of the frames can be shown. If two or more frames are displayed at the same time, it can cause problems like screen tearing."}

It is the county seat of Cheyenne County. The population was 6,757 at the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1867 by the Union Pacific railroad company. It grew up around the military base called Fort Sidney (also known as Sidney Barracks). The soldiers there were stationed to guard transcontinental railroad from potential Indian attacks. When the railroad reached Sidney, it was the end of a sub-division of the rail line and played host to a roundhouse, repair facilities, and a railroad hotel for passengers.\nThe city was named after Sidney Dillon.

The council was held because of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. It lasted for five months in early 1521. The Emperor, Charles V led the council. Other councils (called Imperial Diets) were held in Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, 1495, and 1545, but the most important Diet of Worms was in 1521.\nBackground.\nIn June 1520, Pope Leo X wrote the Papal bull Exsurge Domine (\"Arise, O Lord\"), in which he talked about 41 problems he saw in Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses and his other works. Because of this, the Holy Roman Emperor told Martin Luther to come to the diet. He promised that he would give Luther safe passage to and from it. The Diet started on 23 January 1521. Martin Luther was told that he had to either take back what he had said or defend it.\nEvents of the Diet.\nMost of the important things in the Diet happened between 16-18 April. On 16 April, Martin Luther got to the city of Worms. He was told to come to the Diet at 4 p.m. on the 17th, and given a lawyer. After a day of arguing about his works, he was told that he was acting like a heretic. On the 18th of April, he went home. But Frederick III, Elector of Saxony thought that someone might kill him, so he faked a highway ambush and used this as a reason to hide Luther in one of his castles.\nThe Edict of Worms.\nBy 23 May 1521, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, King of Spain (Castile and Aragon), King of Germany, King of Italy, Lord of the Netherlands, and Titular Duke of Burgundy had had enough of all of this Martin Luther business, so he wrote:\nAfter that, he ended the Diet of Worms.\nHowever, because Luther was hidden in Wartburg Castle, nothing ever happened to him."}

The circuit is put inside of a container made out of materials such as plastic or ceramic. All the wires of the circuit are connected to metal pins, and they stick out of the package on two sides. This way the circuit is able to be used from inside the package.\nThings can also be put in a dual in-line package that are not integrated circuits. A DIP switch is one example of this, where there are switches on top of the package instead of a circuit inside."}

After 72 A.D. Parspatuniq became principality of Great Armenia, which owned two regions (Parspatunik and Marand) in the province of Vaspurakan. The region belonged to the princely family of Parspatuni(Patsparuni, Parspuni, Parsparuni).\nHistory.\nIn antiquity, the main territory of Parspatunik (modern Karadag) was part of the Scythian state-tribal entity. In the western part of Parspatunik, Marand, the center of the ancient region Sangibutu,Ulhu was located . Then the region was part of the kingdom of Urartu. Subsequently, these areas again fell into the power of the Scythians. They later became part of the Median Empire. After the division of the empire of Alexander the Great,\u0435\u0430stern Parspatunik became part of the Media Atropatena. Artashes I annexed \u0435astern Parspatunik to Great Armenia during the military campaign \n. Marand was part of the Armenian kingdom before the conquests of King Artashes I.\nThe princely clan of Parspatuni descended from the Matianian kings of Sangibutu.\nHaving become princes, the naxarars of Parspatuni united under their rule the regions of Parspatunik and Marand, choosing the Marand's Bakurarakert(Greco-Roman Philadelphia) as their capital.\nParspatunik was not included into Vaspurakan after the second partition of Great Armenia in 591 by the Roman and Sasanids empires.\nThen, later, under the rule of the Arab caliphate, the region is no longer part of Vaspurakan. The population of Parspatunik was significantly Islamized during the Caliphate.\nGeographical location and population.\nParspatunik was located between the river Araxes from the north and Parthian empire in the south.\nThe wooded mountain range of Parspatunik(Matiani mts.) was also known in Antiquity as \u0391\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c9\u03bf \u039f\u03c1\u03b7 - the Armenian Mountains, in which there was a passage \u0391\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd - Armenian Gate (\u0534\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0584 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581), what was described in the III-rd century B.C. by a Greek author Eratosthenes(280-202 B.C.) and mentioned again by a XIV-th century Muslim historiographer Hamballah Ghazvini. The road passing through the Armenian Gate in the Middle Ages led to the famous Khudapery Bridge.\nBy its geographical position, Parspatunik was located on the border of the Armenian and Parthian kingdoms. This circumstance explains the Armenian name of the region, which translates as \u201cWall of Persia\u201d from the words \u201cPars\u201d(Persia) and \u201cpat\u201d(wall), due to the fact that the Matiani mountains of Parspatunik served as the ancient border between Armenia and Iran.\nIn the I-VI centuries, this region was the 26th ghawar(region) and the principality of the Armenian province of Vaspurakan, as mentioned by the 7th-century Armenian geographer and historian Anania Shirakatsi .\nThe population of Parspatunik consisted m\u043estly of Iranian(Atropatenian and Caspian) tribes.\nThe Armenian population, previously Matiene and Alarodian tribes, was concentrated in the towns and wooded mountainous areas near the fortresses, where it still existing to this day in modern Iran.\nIn the mountainous wooded territory of Parspatunik (Karadag), adjacent to the right bank of the Araxes, there were small Armenian melikdoms until the end of the First World War.\nPolitical map of the Armenian Highlands in the 16th century during the period of the Turkish-Persian Wars,map of the region in the first half of the XVIIIth century\nSome of the Armenian melikdoms of Karadag(Parspatunik) were founded by settlers from Karabakh(Artsakh).\nThe modern historical region of Parspatunik is located on the territory of the Iranian region Arasbaran(Karadag) and was abandoned by the majority of the Armenian population during the repatriation period 1946-1947. A large number of monuments of Armenian architecture have been preserved in the region.\nThe remaining Armenian population of Parspatunik (Karadag) is concentrated in the mountainous region, on the border of the Iranian provinces of Ardabil and East Azerbaijan."}

Jordan as the supervillain Erik Killmonger.\nPlot.\nThousands of years ago an asteroid crashes into an African country called Wakanda containing an alien metal called vibranium which absorbs vibrations and is the world\u2019s strongest metal as a result. The tribes of Wakanda went to war for the vibranium but then decided to unite under the leadership of a king called the Black Panther. Only one tribe goes into exile in the mountains of Wakanda so that they do not have to be ruled by the Black Panther. Because of using vibranium to make weapons the Wakandans managed to stop anyone else from ever conquering their country and as a result they became the world\u2019s most technologically advanced nation but kept that a secret from everyone else by creating a giant force field around the country and having no relationship with the outside world. Then in the late 20th century T\u2019chaka, King of Wakanda finds out that his brother who is an undercover spy in the United States is secretly smuggling vibranium to the US to help oppressed black people to overthrow the white man. T\u2019chaka then kills his brother and leaves his body unburied to return to Wakanda. T\u2019chaka\u2019s brother\u2019s son finds his father\u2019s body dead and swears to get revenge. Then in 2018, T\u2019chaka\u2019s son T\u2019challa comes back to Wakanda to become the new king following T\u2019chaka\u2019s murder in the movie . M\u2019baku comes from the mountains and challenges T\u2019challa to a fight to become Black Panther. T\u2019challa wins and convinces M\u2019Baku to surrender so that he doesn\u2019t have to kill him. T\u2019challa\u2019s cousin turns out to have joined the American army and worked as an assassin for the CIA known as Killmonger. He since left the CIA and hired a supervillain named Klaue to help him rob the British Museum of its Wakandan artifacts and then murder everyone there. T\u2019challa finds out that Klaue is in South Korea and goes there as the Black Panther to try and capture him only to find himself fighting the CIA. Klaue is captured by CIA agent Everett Ross with T\u2019challa\u2019s help and Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda is actually a rich country. Klaue escapes with Killmonger\u2019s help and Ross is hurt. T\u2019challa takes Ross to Wakanda so that his doctors can fix him. Killmonger then gets Klaue to take him to Wakanda only to reveal to Klaue that he is actually a Wakandan prince and kills Klaue. He then delivers Klaue\u2019s body to Wakanda in exchange for an audience with T\u2019challa and demand the throne. Killmonger and T\u2019challa fight to the death and Killmonger wins. Killmonger becomes King of Wakanda and then wants to use the Wakandan military to conquer all white people in the world and punish them for their crimes against black people. T\u2019challa\u2019s family reaches out to M\u2019baku and asks him to fight Killmonger. M\u2019baku reveals that T\u2019challa survived the fight without having surrendered and that he rescued an injured T\u2019challa to repay him for having spared his life. T\u2019challa is healed by M\u2019baku and T\u2019challa confronts Killmonger. Killmonger has no plan to fight T\u2019challa since he believes that now that he is king there is no need for violence. T\u2019challa tries to get the throne back by fighting to the death against Killmonger and wins. T\u2019challa then decides to share Wakanda\u2019s technology with the world. \nReception.\nThe Black Panther movie was generally praised by the critics and was actually nominated for an Oscar. The CIA helped promote the movie on its Twitter account before the Oscars."}

Citizen scientists usually collect information and send it to a team of scientists, who examine and process it. Most citizen scientists are volunteers and do not get paid.\nSometimes scientists ask for help from people who are collecting information anyway. For example, scientists studying birds might ask birdwatchers to record which birds they see and hear and then tell the scientists. The National Audubon Society has been running a Christmas Bird Count since 1900.\nSmartphones and GPS have made citizen science easier to do and easier for scientists to ask for and use. For example, in FrogWatch USA, citizen scientists go to places where frogs live and use their phones to make recordings of the sounds they hear.\nNot all citizen science programs mean going outside. In EyeWire, volunteers visit a website and click on what they can see. This helps scientists tell how the brain works with things the eyes see.\nIn other citizen science programs, volunteers measure temperature to track climate change, tell scientists when different plants start to grow in the spring, search for aliens in space, and design better bicycle routes."}

They are about to go on a six-month naval exercise. Some well-known British actors had early roles in the film. They include Timothy Spall, Lisa Maxwell and John Altman. It was Gary Oldman's first film.\nIt was made by Channel Four Films and was shown in the first week of Channel 4 broadcasting. It was also one of the first films in the UK to be shown on television less than three years after its initial cinema release. Before this event, a three-year delay was made by the Cinema Exhibitors' Association.\nPlot.\nThe film follows several naval ratings with the story switching between the characters. The naval ratings prepare for their coming months away at sea. The action takes place around the bars and clubs of the Union Street district of Plymouth. One major event that affects all the characters is the hospitalisation, and eventual death, of Daniel, played by Gary Oldman. This is after a violent assault by a nightclub bouncer.\nProduction.\nGregg got the idea for the film from his own experiences as a student at Plymouth Art College.\nIt was shot on location. It includes interior scenes in two Union Street pubs, \"The Phoenix\" and \"The Two Trees\".\nThe film was commissioned by Channel 4, before the channel had started broadcasting. It was shown in November 1982, close to Remembrance Sunday. This was in the first week of the new channel\nIn June 1982, before being shown on TV, the film had been shown in a cinema, the \"Screen on the Hill\" in Hampstead.\nThis was for publicity of the film and the start of Channel 4. It took advantage of the role that the Royal Navy had played in the Falklands War. It was also an important event in the relationship between cinema and television in the UK. In \"Independent Television in Britain\" (Volume 6, 2003), Paul Bonner and Lesley Aston note that:\nSoundtrack.\nBackground music is from \"Aragon\" by Brian Eno.\nReception.\nChannel 4's regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), raised concerns about use of swearing in the script.\nThe film won the Golden Charybdis Award at the 1982 Taormina International Film Festival."}

{"id": "729673", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=729673", "title": "Stilton cheese", "text": "Stilton is an English cheese, made in two types: Blue, and White. Blue stilton has \"Penicillium roqueforti\" added. This gives it a characteristic smell and taste. White is the same cheese without having the penicillium added. Both have been given the status of a protected designation of origin (PDO) by the European Commission. This means that the cheese must be made to a strict code in one of the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire or Nottinghamshire. \nCheese made in the village of Stilton, which is now in Cambridgeshire can not be sold as \"Stilton\".\nHistory.\nFrances Pawlett (or Paulet), a cheese maker of Wymondham, Leicestershire, has been credited as the person who set modern Stilton cheese's shape and style characteristics in the 1720s, \nbut others have also been named. \nA recipe for a Stilton cheese was published in 1721 by Richard Bradley.\nThe Stilton Cheesemaker's Association say the first person to market Blue Stilton cheese was Cooper Thornhill. He was the owner of the Bell Inn on the Great North Road, in the village of Stilton, Huntingdonshire. Huntingdonshire is now a district in modern Cambridgeshire. The story is that in 1730, Thornhill discovered a distinctive blue cheese while visiting a small farm near Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire\u00a0\u2014 possibly in Wymondham. He fell in love with the cheese and made a business arrangement that gave the Bell Inn exclusive marketing rights to Blue Stilton. The Great North Road, a main stagecoach route from London to Northern England, passed through the village of Stilton. So he was able to promote the sale of Stilton cheese.\nIn 1936 the Stilton Cheesemakers' Association (SCMA) was formed. They wanted to get legal protection for the quality and origin of the cheese. In 1966, Stilton was granted legal protection via a certification trade mark, the only British cheese to have received this status.\nManufacture and PDO status.\nBlue Stilton's blue veins are created by piercing the crust of the cheese with stainless steel needles. This allows air into the core. The cheese is then ripened for nine to twelve weeks.\nFor cheese to use the name \"Stilton\", it must be made in one of the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, and must use pasteurised local milk. The manufacturers of Stilton cheese in these counties applied for and received protection under European Law (PDO = protected designation of origin) in 1996.\nStichelton is made in the same way as Stilton cheese and uses cows' milk from Nottinghamshire, but the milk is unpasteurised and so under the PDO it cannot be designated as true Stilton.\n just six dairies are licensed to make Stilton (three in Leicestershire, two in Nottinghamshire and one in Derbyshire). Each dairy is checked by an independent inspection agency accredited to European Standard EN 45011. Four of the licensed dairies are based in the Vale of Belvoir, which straddles the Nottinghamshire-Leicestershire border. This area is seen to be the heartland of Stilton production. Dairies are located in the town of Melton Mowbray and the villages of Colston Bassett, Cropwell Bishop, Long Clawson and Saxelbye. \nAnother Leicestershire dairy was located in the grounds of Quenby Hall near the village of Hungarton. There had been a dairy there in the 18th century. Quenby Hall restarted Stilton production in a new dairy in August 2005 but the business closed in 2011. \nThe former Dairy Crest-owned licensed dairy that produced Stilton at Hartington in Derbyshire was acquired by the Long Clawson dairy in 2008 and closed in 2009, with production transferred to Leicestershire. Two former employees set up the Hartington Creamery at Pikehall in Hartington parish which was licensed in 2014.\nStilton cheese cannot be produced in the village that gave the cheese its name. Stilton village is not in the three permitted counties; it is in the historic county of Huntingdonshire in Cambridgeshire. The Original Cheese Company applied to Defra to amend the Stilton PDO to include the village but the application was rejected in 2013.\nStilton cheese was also manufactured in Staffordshire. The Nuttall family of Beeby, Leicestershire opened a Stilton cheese factory in Uttoxeter in 1892 to take advantage of the local milk and good transport links.\nCharacteristics.\nTo be called \"Blue Stilton\", a cheese must:\nStilton has a typical fat content of approximately 35%, and protein content of approximately 23%.\nSimilar cheeses.\nA number of blue cheeses are made in a similar way to Blue Stilton. These cheeses get their blue veins and distinct flavour from the use of one or more saprotrophic fungi, such as \"Penicillium roqueforti\" and \"Penicillium glaucum\". Since the PDO came into effect, some British supermarkets have stocked a generic \"British Blue cheese\". Other makers have adopted their own names and styles. Other typical British blue cheeses are Oxford Blue and Shropshire Blue.\nMany countries make blue cheeses. Italy has Gorgonzola cheese, a greenish-blue cheese made from cows' milk. France has Fourme d'Ambert made in Auvergne with cows' milk and Roquefort, made with ewes' milk. Denmark makes Danish Blue Cheese. The Netherlands makes Ruscello.\nHow to eat.\nBlue Stilton is often eaten with celery or pears. It can also be added as a flavouring to vegetable soup, such as cream of celery or broccoli. \nIt is often eaten with crackers, biscuits or bread. It can also be used to make a blue cheese sauce served over a steak. It can be crumbled over a salad. The cheese is traditionally eaten at Christmas. The edible rind of the cheese forms naturally during the aging process.\nWhite Stilton is the same cheese but has not had the \"Penicillium roqueforti\" mould introduced into it. It is a crumbly, creamy, open textured cheese.\nDreams.\nA 2005 survey by the British Cheese Board reported that Stilton seemed to cause unusual dreams, with 75% of men and 85% of women experiencing \"odd and vivid\" dreams after eating a 20-gram serving of the cheese half an hour prior to sleeping.\nCultural influence.\nGeorge Orwell wrote an essay, \"In Defence of English Cooking\", first published in the \"Evening Standard\" on 15 December 1945. While enumerating the high points of British cuisine, he touches on Stilton: \"Then there are the English cheeses. There are not many of them, but I fancy that Stilton is the best cheese of its type in the world, with Wensleydale not far behind.\"\nThe Stilton Cheese Makers Association produced a fragrance called \"Eau de Stilton\", which was \"very different to the very sweet perfumes you smell wafting down the street as someone walks past you.\"\nThe search for an unpasteurised Stilton cheese was a plot element of a \"Chef!\" episode titled \"The Big Cheese\", aired on BBC1 on 25 February 1993.\nA character named G. D'Arcy \"Stilton\" Cheesewright appears in several of the Jeeves novels of P. G. Wodehouse."}

This claim started the conflict between France and the Spanish Empire. The Triple Alliance, (England, Sweden, and The Netherlands,) decided to get involved in this war, but not allying with either side. They saw 2 countries now weakened by war and realized they could expand. They also did this for the protection of each side, because both were a vital piece to trade in Europe and the world. The French soldiers marched into Flanders, (now in Belgium) and easily took over the city. Just a year later after almost a standoff, they made a peace treaty with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.

Muhammad Ghori invaded India in 1175 A.D. After the conquest of Multan and Punjab, he advanced towards Delhi. The rajput chiefs of northern India headed by Prithvi Raj Chauhan defeated him in the First Battle of Terrain in 1191 A.D. After about a year, Muhammad Ghori came again to avenge his defeat. A furious battle was fought again in Terrain in 1192 A.D. in which the Rajputs were defeated and Prithvi Raj Chauhan was captured and put to death. The Second Battle of Terrain, however, proved to be a decisive battle that laid the foundations of Muslim rule in Northern India. Ghori built many mosques and libraries after laying muslim rule in india. The period between 1206 A.D. and 1526 A.D. in India's history is known as the Delhi Sultanate period. During this period of over three hundred years, five dynasties ruled in Delhi. These were: the Slave dynasty (1206-90), Khilji dynasty (1290-1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320-1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414-51), and Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526).The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206\u20131526).[5][6] Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk/Slave dynasty (1206\u20131290), the Khalji dynasty (1290\u20131320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320\u20131414),[7] the Sayyid dynasty (1414\u20131451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451\u20131526). It covered large swathes of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh as well as some parts of southern Nepal.[8]\nAs a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one among a number of principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori (who had conquered large parts of northern India), including Yildiz, Aibek and Qubacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves.[9] After a long period of infighting, the Mamluks were overthrown in the Khalji revolution which marked the transfer of power from the Turks to a heterogeneous Indo-Muslim nobility.[10][11] Both of the resulting Khalji and Tughlaq dynasties respectively saw a new wave of rapid Muslim conquests deep into South India.[12] The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent.[13] This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara Empire and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off.[14][15] In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.\nThe sultanate is noted for its integration of the Indian subcontinent into a global cosmopolitan culture[16] (as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language[17] and Indo-Islamic architecture[18][19]), being one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate)[20] and for enthroning one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.[21] Bakhtiyar Khalji's annexations were responsible for the large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples[22] (leading to the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal[23][24]), and the destruction of universities and libraries.[25][26] Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture in India[27][28] and the rest of the region."}

Gunray was a neimoidian politician who served as the Viceroy of the Trade Federation during their invasion of Naboo and later served as a prominent Separatist leader during the conflict known as the Clone Wars. Gunray appears in , and of the Star Wars Prequels Trilogy as well as in other media such as the Animated Television series.\nThe Invasion of Naboo.\nThe Invasion of Naboo was an event that took place 32 years before the events of . The Invasion began as a blockade around the planet, with Nute Gunray taking charge of the fleet, this blockade was set up in order to protest the taxation of trade routes by the new republic, however the real intention of the blockade was to stage a droid invasion of the planet so that Senator Palpatine (who was secretly controlling Nute Gunray as Darth Sidious) could gain sympathy in the Galactic Senate. After the Blockade was set up, the trade federation began sending Battle Droids down to the planets surface. This event was seen throughout .\nNegotiations.\nThe Republic sent Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to negotiate with the Viceroy, Gunray assumed they had arrived to force a negotiation so, after consulting Darth Sidious, ordered their death. Droideka's were sent but the two Jedi were able to escape to the planet below were they witnesses the invasion first hand. Nute Gunray would later descend to the planet below of Naboo in an attempt to force the planet's queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala into a deal, he would eventually be stopped.\nThe Senate.\nNute Gunray argues that everything he does is legal and he also states that he would not do anything without the approval of the senate, when saying this he is talking about the trade blockade, not the invasion. If proof could be shown to the senate that the trade federation had began an invasion of the planet, the republic would intervene, but the senate could not be convinced. Gunray and the trade federation had a presence in the senate and were even accused of taking part in bureaucracy.\nRelationship with the Sith.\nNute Gunray was under direct command of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. This was the Sith alias of Senator Palpatine. Sidious commanded Gunray to invade Naboo. By creating an artificial conflict, Sidious could gain sympathy for Naboo in the senate. He could use this sympathy along with the Republic's lack of action to achieve the political position of Supreme Chancellor. Nute Gunray was just a pawn in Sidious' plan to achieve the position of supreme chancellor. By working as the necessary opposition, Gunray was not aware that this was his purpose but despite this Sidious was able to ascend to Supreme Chancellor and he would not be able to do this without Nute Gunray.\nNute Gunray was not fond of his Sith overlords. When Darth Sidious introduced Darth Maul in a hologram to Gunray, Gunray was not pleased and when the communication ended exclaimed \"This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!\" referring to the two Sith. It is likely that Gunray disliked the Sith as he feared their power and they could threaten his position. Gunray also feared they could be too controlling.\nNute Gunray also knew the Sith Lord Darth Tyrannus was Sidious's second apprentice and played a large part in the separatist rebellion along with Gunray. They were seen together on Geonosis.\nSeparatist.\nAfter the conflict on Naboo Nute Gunray along with others from the Trade Federation, Banking Clan, Techno Union and others form the Confederacy of Independent Systems (C.I.S.) the C.I.S. would be what fought against the Republic During the conflict known as The Clone Wars.\nSeparatist Council.\nGunray was the chairman of the separatist council and sat on it alongside others such as Count Dooku, the Corporate Alliance\u2019s Passel Argente, the InterGalactic Banking Clan\u2019s San Hill, the Commerce Guild\u2019s Shu Mai, the Techno Union\u2019s Wat Tambor, Poggle the Lesser of Geonosis, and Senators Po Nudo and Tikkes.\nDeath.\nNute Gunray was killed by Darth Vader under the orders of his new master Darth Sidious on Mustafar after Darth Sidious ordered the Separatist council move there as Sidious promised the war would soon be at an end.\nQuotes.\n\"This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!\"\n\"What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk!\"\n\"She can't do that! Shoot her, or something!\"\n\"She has disappeared, my lord. One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.\"\n\"And the Jedi?\"\n\"My lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.\"\n\"Yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.\"\n\"No need to report that to him until we have something to report!\"\n\"My lord, is that, legal?\"\n\"Ah, victory!\"\n\"The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want...\"\n\"Safe? Hum. Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.\""}

During the French Revolution it came to mean freedom and the pursuit of liberty, but Phrygian caps did not originally have this meaning. The original cap of liberty was the Roman \"pileus\", the felt cap of freed slaves of ancient Rome, which also had to do with Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. In the 16th century, the Roman icons of liberty were used again in emblem books and coin studying handbooks where the figure of Libertas is usually shown with a \"pileus\". The most common use of a headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the Roman iconography was commonly used again was in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was used in the form of a hat of that time. In the 18th century, the traditional liberty cap was often used in English prints and from 1789 on in French prints, too; but it was not until the early 1790s, that the French cap of liberty was most often used in the Phrygian form.\nIt is used in the coats of arms of some republics in the place where in a monarchy a crown would be used. It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, most commonly France's Marianne, are usually depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.

It was broadcast by the BBC between 1975 and 1983. It was described as the \"\"Z-Cars\" of nursing\".\nFrom 1979 the show changed to a seasonal twice-weekly soap opera format.\nBackground and creators.\nThe show's title came from the name of the hospital where the first series was set. This was St. Angela's in Battersea. In the 1980s this was changed to Heath Green Hospital in Birmingham. The series was devised by Paula Milne. Early producers included Morris Barry and Ron Craddock. The first episode was directed by Julia Smith. She became the show's producer in 1979. Her script editor on the later series was Tony Holland. Filming took place at St James' Hospital in Balham, London. This has since been demolished. Location filming for the fictional Heath Green Hospital took place at Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry. This has since been demolished and replaced by University Hospital Coventry.\nJulia Smith enlisted Tony Holland as the \"Angels\" script editor after the show became a twice-weekly soap. In the 1980s Smith and Holland created \"EastEnders\". Writers on its first series included Jill Hyem, Anne Valery and Adele Rose. Hyem and Valery later co-wrote \"Tenko\".\nActors.\nThe series included some young actors who would later become better known. These include Fiona Fullerton, \u00c9rin Geraghty, Lesley Dunlop, Julie Dawn Cole, Angela Bruce, Clare Clifford and Pauline Quirke. Additionally, Kathryn Apanowicz, Shirley Cheriton and Judith Jacob all later appeared in \"EastEnders\". Mamta Kaash played a key role in the hospital drama \"Casualty\".\nTheme music.\nThe guitar-driven theme tune, similar to American police dramas of the time, was called \"Motivation\". It was composed and performed by Alan Parker.\nCritical reception.\n\"Angels\", tackled issues such as contraception, alcoholism and promiscuity as part of the nurses' lives. \"Angels\" received criticism for its unglamorous depiction of the nursing profession. \"Angels\" tried to be realistic and authentic. Each actress was required to work on a real hospital ward to gain experience.\nBooks.\nSome TV tie-in novels were published to coincide with the series.\nDVD Release.\nOn 18 March 2013 Simply Media released the Series 1 (fifteen episodes) of \"Angels\" on DVD. Series 2 was released in September 2014."}

It lasted for roughly two decades. During First-wave feminism, women wanted to get the right to vote in elections and to be treated equally to men when it cames to owning and heriting property. Second-wave feminism focused more on issues of sexuality (sex education, contraception, abortion, family planning) and violence directed against women (domestic violence, rape, and Women's shelters). In many countries, there were also changes to the laws about divorce. \nIt was a reaction to women returning to their roles as housewives and mothers after the end of the Second World War. The men that had to leave the workforce to join the defence forces had returned and women were fired from their positions and replaced by men. This movement was initially concentrated in the United States of America and then spread to other Western countries. This movement was triggered by the publishing of Betty Friedan\u2019s book, \"The Feminine Mystique\", a renowned feminist text credited for daring to break social conventions regarding the portrayal of women. Friedan was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s book, \"The Second Sex\", first published in Paris in 1949. \nIn the 1980s, there were disputes among different feminist groups (known as Feminist sex wars), over issues of sexuality and pornography. These disputes started the third-wave feminism in the early 1990s."}
