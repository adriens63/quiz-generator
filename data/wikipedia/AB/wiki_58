But, the park\u2019s most famous attraction is cherry blossoms.\nHistory.\nThousands of cherry trees bloom around the waters of the Tidal Basin, which reflect the trees\u2019 images. The basin was created in the late 1800s to prevent the Potomac River from flooding. These pink and white flowers serve as a symbol of international friendship. \nThe original cherry trees were a gift from Japan. On March 26, 1912, more than 3,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington. Most were planted around the Tidal Basin. But cherry trees were also planted near the Washington Monument and the White House.\nThe park service maintains West Potomac Park, and helps protect the cherry trees.\nCherry Blossom Festival.\nIt is a wonderful gift that is over 100 years old now. The 1912 gift from the people of Japan has grown to this 3,800 trees. The cherry blossoms also serve as a symbol of the beginning of springtime. The trees burst with colors of soft pink and white. The blossoming of the cherry blossoms every spring is sort of the great springtime celebration, not only in the District of Columbia but throughout the United States.\nEvery year, Washington celebrates the arrival of spring with a two-week Cherry Blossom Festival. More than 1.5 million people from around the world visit the nation\u2019s capital during the festival. They all hope to see the cherry trees at their \u201cpeak bloom.\u201d Park officials define \"peak bloom\" as the period when 70 percent of Washington\u2019s most common cherry tree variety -- the Yoshino trees -- are blooming. Yoshino cherry trees are one of 12 types of cherry trees in Washington. Peak bloom lasts several days each year.\nExperts begin making peak bloom predictions in February. Visitors make their travel plans to Washington based on these predictions."}

The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major storm on the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura formed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 16, and formed into a tropical depression by August 20. On August 21, Laura strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm, and breaking 1995's Hurricane Luis's record by eight days.\nLaura first moved over the Lesser Antilles and brushing Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, before making landfall in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, killing four people in the Dominican Republic and 31\u00a0in Haiti. The storm then moved over the entire island of Cuba, forcing the evacuation of more than 260,000\u00a0people. Then, the outer rainbands of Laura moved over parts of the Florida Keys and Southern Florida. It then moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before undergoing rapid intensification by August\u00a026. Later that day, Laura became a major hurricane, and soon reached a peak intensity of , making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane.\nThen, just a couple of hours after reaching peak intensity, at 6:00 UCT on August 27, Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana just below peak intensity with 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 939 mbar, at the same wind speed of the 1856 Last Island hurricane. It was the 10th strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit the United States in terms of wind speed, killed 42 people in the U.S, and caused $19 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States and inland areas. After landfall, Laura weakened, falling to tropical storm status later in the day, and tropical depression status over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura weakened to a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the East Coast. Overall, Laura caused $19.1 billion in damage and killed 81 people. Areas that were badly affected by Laura, mostly southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, were badly affected by more flooding and strong winds during Hurricane Delta around six weeks later."}

In 1992, she was enlisted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, at that point a British settlement, Edmonds grew up with her sisters on their family's homestead close Magaguadavic Lake, not a long way from the outskirt with the State of Maine. Edmonds fled home at age fifteen to get away from a masterminded marriage and the maltreatment of her dad, who needed a child rather than a girl. Supported by her mom, who herself wedded youthful, Edmonds got away from the marriage and eventually embraced the appearance of Franklin Thompson to travel simpler. A male mask permitted Edmonds to eat, travel, and work freely. Intersection into the United States of America, Edmonds worked for an effective Bible book retailer and distributer in Hartford, Connecticut.\nSarah Emma Edmonds' enthusiasm for experience was started by a book she read in her childhood by Maturin Murray Ballou called Fanny Campbell, the Female Pirate Captain', recounting to the account of Fanny Campbell and her undertakings on a privateer transport during the American Revolution while dressed as a lady Fanny stayed dressed as a man so as to seek after different experiences, to which Edmonds credits her longing to dress in drag. During the Civil War, on May 25, 1861, she enrolled in Company F of the second Michigan Infantry, otherwise called the Flint Union Grays. On her subsequent attempt, she masked herself as a man named \"Franklin Flint Thompson,\" the center name potentially after the city she chipped in, Flint, Michigan. She felt that it was her obligation to serve her nation and was genuinely energetic towards her new nation. She from the start filled in as a male field nurture, taking an interest in a few crusades under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg, Fredericksburg, and others. Be that as it may, a few history specialists guarantee that these reports place her in more than one area simultaneously.\nEdmonds' profession took a turn during the war when a Union covert agent in Richmond, Virginia was found and went before a terminating crew, and a companion, James Vesey, was executed in a snare. She exploited the open spot and the chance to vindicate her companion's demise. She applied for, and won, the situation as Franklin Thompson. Despite the fact that there is no verification in her military records that she really filled in as a government agent, she expounded broadly on her encounters masked as a covert agent during the war.[page needed]\nMaking a trip into hostile area to assemble data required Emma to think of numerous masks. One camouflage required Edmonds to utilize silver nitrate to color her skin dark, wear a dark hairpiece, and stroll into the Confederacy masked as an individual of color by the name of Cuff. Some other time she entered as an Irish vendor lady by the name of Bridget O'Shea, guaranteeing that she was offering apples and cleanser to the officers. Once more, she was \"working for the Confederates\" as a dark laundress when a bundle of authentic papers dropped out of an official's coat. At the point when Thompson came back to the Union with the papers, the commanders were enchanted. Some other time, she filled in as an investigator in Kentucky as Charles Mayberry, revealing a Confederacy operator.\nEdmonds' profession as Frank Thompson reached a conclusion when she traveled to Berry's Brigade so as to convey mail to Union powers. While trying to take an easy route, she was tossed into a jettison by her donkey before arriving at the detachment; Edmonds continued serious wounds and couldn't complete the outing before the First Battle of Bull Run had initiated. She relinquished her obligation in the military, expecting that on the off chance that she went to a military emergency clinic she would be found. She took a look at herself into a private medical clinic, expecting to come back to military life once she had recovered. When she recouped, be that as it may, she saw banners posting Frank Thompson as a coward. As opposed to come back to the military under another false name or as Frank Thompson, gambling execution for abandonment, she chose to fill in as a female medical caretaker at a Washington, D.C. clinic for injured troopers run by the United States Christian Commission. There was hypothesis that Edmonds may have abandoned on account of John Reid having been released months sooner. There is proof in his journal that she had referenced leaving before she had contracted jungle fever. Her individual warriors praises her military help, and significantly after her camouflage was found, they thought of her as a decent fighter. She was alluded to as a courageous warrior and was dynamic in each fight her regiment confronted."}

A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an algorithm, is called a decision procedure for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem \"given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?\" would give the steps for determining whether x evenly divides y. One such algorithm is long division. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called decidable.\nDecision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability, that is, the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable."}

According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. \nThe USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies. These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga\nnizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes. \nReception.\nThe program has been positively received. However, there has been some criticism. For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds. This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home. Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat. Since some people do not eat dairy or meat products, this created a problem. \nIt has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program. "}

It was published by HarperCollins and released on July 28, 2009. It was released in China on July 31, 2010.\nPlot.\nBluestar is also called Bluefur and Bluepaw during different parts of her life.\nBluestar's Prophecy follows the life of Bluestar, the future leader of ThunderClan. The book opens with a prologue that recounts the Bluestar's death in \"Warriors: A Dangerous Path\" from Bluestar's point of view. The book then goes back to Bluestar's childhood, during which Goosefeather, the Clan's medicine cat, receives a prophecy about Bluepaw being a fire that blazes through the forest, but who may be destroyed by water. A few moons later, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, is killed by the WindClan's medicine cat, Hawkheart.\nBluepaw's childhood is defined by her relationship with her sister, Snowpaw, which is damaged when Snowpaw - later Snowfur - falls in love with Thistleclaw, whom Bluefur finds arrogant and untrustworthy. Snowfur is later killed when she is hit by a speeding car, leaving a heartbroken Bluefur to care for her son, Whitekit.\nAs a warrior, Bluefur meets a RiverClan warrior named Oakheart; although they do not like each other at first, they eventually fall in love. They decide to spend one night together at Fourtrees, the regular Clan Gathering plan, but agree that for the good of their Clans, they will never meet again. One moon later, Bluefur is horrified to find out that she is expecting kits. Thrushpelt, a ThunderClan warrior with feelings for Bluefur, offers to help her take care of her kits. Bluefur accepts his offer, allowing the rest of ThunderClan to believe that Thrushpelt is the father of her kits.\nSunstar, ThunderClan's leader, tells Bluefur that he was planning to make her ThunderClan's new deputy, but because of her kits, he will promote Thistleclaw to deputy instead. After having a vision of Thistleclaw drenched in blood, Bluefur realizes that allowing him to become deputy and then leader would be deadly to the Clan. She decides to take her three kits to Oakheart and let them be raised in RiverClan. During this, one of her kits, Mosskit, freezes to death white her other kits, Mistykit and Stonekit, make it to Riverclan. She explains the disappearance of her kits by pretending they have been taken by a starving predator.\nWithout her kits, Bluefur is made deputy. After Sunstar loses his final life to dogs, she becomes leader, receiving her own nine lives and taking on the name Bluestar. After successfully leading ThunderClan for several seasons, she receives another prophecy from the ThunderClan medicine cat, Spottedleaf: \u201cFire alone can save our Clan.\u201d Later, while on patrol with Whitestorm and her deputy, Redtail, she catches sight of a bright ginger house cat named Rusty. Recognizing him as the cat from Spottedleaf's prophecy, she names him Firepaw and accepts him into ThunderClan."}

It is the fifth \"Super Edition\" in the \"Warriors\" novel series. \"Yellowfang's Secret\" was first released in hardcover on 9 October 2012.\n\"Yellowfang's Secret\" follows Yellowfang, the former ShadowClan and ThunderClan medicine cat, during her early life in ShadowClan. Yellowfang trains as an apprentice but realizes that she would be a better healer, called medicine cat in the books. The book takes place at around the same time as the other Super Editions \"Bluestar's Prophecy\" and \"Crookedstar's Promise\". It is written for readers 8-12 years old.\nPlot.\nYellowfang is called Yellowkit when she is born. Her parents are Brightflower and Brackenfoot. Her siblings are Nutkit and Rowankit. Yellowfang always has a special power: She feels other people's pain as if it were hers. When she is small, both she and Nutkit have pain in their stomach one day, even though Nutkit is the only one who is really sick.\nWhen Yellowkit is older, she goes to learn from Deerleap. Later, she is called Yellowpaw. She becomes close with a cat called Raggedpelt. The other cats do not like Raggedpelt because the think his father might have been a house cat. In these books, clan cats do not like house cats because they think they are weak. Yellowpaw tries to help Raggedpaw find out about his father. But when they find he really was a house cat, things become worse. Hal, the house cat, rejects Raggedpelt and then Raggedpelt kills Hal. Another female cat, Foxheart, also likes Raggedpelt, but he likes Yellowpaw.\nYellowpaw is later called Yellowfang. Sagewhisker, the ShadowClan medicine cat, convinces Yellowfang that her power to feel pain would make her a very good medicine cat. At first, Yellowfang wants to be a warrior instead, but later she changes her mind. Yellowfang becomes Sagewhisker's apprentice and takes the medicine cats' vows. In this book, being a medicine cat means never having a mate or kittens. But Yellowfang stays with Raggedpelt in secret for a long time.\nYellowfang finds she is pregnant. Because this is against the medicine cat vows, Yellowfang gives birth in secret. Only one kit survives. She names the kit Brokenkit and gives it to Raggedpelt. Many people think Foxheart is Brokenkit's mother. Brokenkit grows up spoiled, and cruel. Eventually, Brokenkit becomes the warrior Brokentail, and later, gains rank in the clan. Brokentail trains his apprentices harshly. When Raggedpelt tells Brokentail it is too much, Brokentail pretends to agree but then plans to kill him to become leader of the clan. Brokentail makes it look like people from another clan, WindClan, killed Raggedpelt.\nBrokentail becomes Brokenstar. He rules ShadowClan cruelly. Using his father's death as an excuse, he has the clan attack other clans. He begins training kits before they are six months old, which is against the rules. He tells old cats to leave the camp. When a kit dies in battle, Yellowfang speaks out; Brokenstar soon secretly sets up another plan, accusing her of the deaths of two kits, and banishing her from the Clan.\nYellowfang leaves; eventually she enters ThunderClan territory, where, exhausted by rage and hunger, she is apprehended by Firepaw (a scene initially depicted in \"Into the Wild\" from Firepaw's perspective), where after a brief fight, Yellowfang admits defeat. Yellowfang is later cared for by Firepaw as a punishment from Bluestar, the Thunderclan leader, from feeding Yellowfang before he fed the clan.\nWhat people thought.\nBarnes and Noble said this book was \"an epic stand alone adventure.\" As of September 2020, it had a ranking of 4.7 out of 5 stars."}

Taxonomy is the way scientists put living things in groups to show how they are related to each other. Olfactores is part of the phylum Chordata, animals with notochords. These are rods of tissue that form inside the developing embryo. In many organisms, the notochord helps the spine or nervous system grow, but some animals have only a notochord and no spinal bones. Olfactores contains Vetulicolia, Tunicata (Urochordata) and Vertebrata (also named Craniata). Most animals in Chordata are also in Olfactores. Only the animals in Cephalochordata are in Chordata but not Olfactores.\nScientists started to think taxonomy needed a special name for this group of living things in 2006. They studied large numbers of data and saw a pattern that said the organisms in Olfactores had a relationship with each other that they did not have with cephalochordates. The name \"olfactores\" comes from Latin word \"olfactus\" for \"sense of smell.\" Scientists named this clade \"Olfactores\" because the animals in it grow a pharynx as part of their respiratory system and use it to breathe. Cephalochordates, for example the lancelet, do not have respiratory systems and they do not have any organs whose job is only to smell things."}

{"id": "785965", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=785965", "title": "The Good Place", "text": "The Good Place is an American television show. It is about the afterlife and philosophy. It was on television for four seasons.\nThe show is a sitcom, which means it is short (22 minutes, not counting commercials) and meant to be funny. In most episodes, the characters learn an idea about ethics or the study of telling right from wrong. For example, in the second season, there was an episode about the trolley problem.\nPremise.\nA woman named Eleanor (Kristen Bell) opens her eyes in a waiting room. A man named Michael (Ted Danson) tells her that she is dead and in the afterlife. He says that some people do bad things when they are alive and go to bad place when they die, where they are tortured to punish them. Other people do good things and go to a good place when they die. He tells her she is in part of \"the Good Place,\" a neighborhood with a few hundred people who all lived good lives. Eleanor also meets Janet (D'arcy Carden), a cheerful robot-like woman who runs the neighborhood and likes to help people.\nHowever, Michael talks more about Eleanor's life on Earth, and Eleanor realizes someone has made a mistake: she was really supposed to go to the Bad Place instead. Eleanor realizes that if she keeps acting the way she acted on Earth, she will be caught and sent to the bad afterlife. Eleanor tricks another dead person, ethics professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), into teaching her ethics so she can pretend to be good and hide in the Good Place. As Chidi gives Eleanor lessons, she becomes better for real.\nEleanor learns that another bad person is also in the good place by mistake. A DJ named Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto) has been pretending to be a Buddhist monk named Jianyu. She also meets her neighbor, Tahani (Jameela Jamil). Tahani is an elegant but mean philanthropist who spent her life on Earth raising money for charities but did not really care about anyone.\nAt the end of the first season, Eleanor figures out that her neighborhood is really part of the Bad Place. Michael and most of the people in it are demons. She, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani have all been tricked into torturing each other. Over the next three seasons, these characters learn more about ethics and try to save themselves and other people from the Bad Place.\nStructure and style.\nIn most sitcoms, things go back to the way they were at the beginning of each episode. This did not happen much in \"The Good Place\". David Sims of \"The Atlantic\" said the first season was more like a \"serialized sci-fi drama\" in plot. But it was told in a light, sitcom style that critics said was funny.\nWhen the show was renewed for a second season, the writers decided that instead of trying to stay on television as long as possible, they wanted to tell one story with a clear ending. They planned the story for seasons two, three and four but were not sure exactly how long it would take to tell it.\nMeaning.\nThe story was inspired by the short story \"No Exit\" by Jean-Paul Sartre and also by the HBO series \"The Leftovers\".\nUCLA professor Pamela Hieronymi was Schur's advisor while he was making \"The Good Place\". Much of the philosophy was based on \"What We Owe to Each Other\", by T.M. Scanlon. Hieronymi appears as herself in the last episode of the show.\n\"It really sort of lit up a room in my brain that had been searching for a way to explain the kind of thing that I wanted to get at,\" Schur said in an interview with \"BuzzFeed News\". \"And that was the idea that we owe certain things to other people, and the job of being alive on earth is to figure out what you owe to them and how you can provide it for them. That's the only way that any that there will ever be any progress.\"\nLike the shows Schur made before \"The Good Place\", there is a focus on how important friendship is. Schur has said the friendship between Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins on \"Parks and Recreation\" inspired some of \"The Good Place\".\nReception.\n\"The Good Place\" was nominated for many awards and won a few of them. \"The Good Place\" was nominated for 13 Emmys including Outstanding Comedy Series but did not win any. \"The Good Place\" won a Peabody Award in 2019.\nIn 2019, it was nominated for the Producer's Guide of America's Danny Thomas Award for Outstanding Producer of Episodic Television, Comedy. It was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy and Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy for Kristen Bell. In 2018, Ted Danson was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Maya Rudolph was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2018, the Critics Choice Awards nominated Kristen Bell for Best Actress in a Comedy Series and Ted Danson for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. Ted Danson won. In 2018, \"The Good Place\" won the American Film Institute's AFI Television Programs of the Year award.\n\"The Good Place\" has a 97% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Separately, seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 scored 92%, 100%, 98% and 100%.\nSophie Gilbert of \"The Atlantic\" said \"The Good Place\" could also be a way of thinking about television itself. Judge Gen is like fun-loving fans who binge shows and make fan videos. Janet is like a long-term fan who can go back and watch any episode at any time.\nPhilosophical ideas mentioned by name on \"The Good Place\".\nThese are some of the ideas that the characters talk about on the show."}

It has 22 episodes. The season started with the episode \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" and ended with \"Blood Feud\". The season was first put on DVD for Region 1 on August 6, 2002, Region 2 on July 8, 2002, and Region 4 on July 24, 2002. The season's executive producers were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. They were the executive producers for the first season. The episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" won a Primetime Emmy Award.\nProduction.\n\"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\" was the first episode made in the season. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" was broadcast first because Bart Simpson was liked by many people in 1990. The 2nd season had a new opening sequence. It was shorter than the one before (which was about 90 seconds). In the opening sequence before, it showed Bart taking a bus stop sign. The opening sequence in the 2nd season shows Bart skateboarding past characters that were shown in the first season. There were three opening sequences made for this season. One was 75 seconds, one was 45 seconds, and one was 25 seconds. This was done so that editors of \"The Simpsons\" could do more with the length of each episode.\nMany new characters were first shown in this season: Mayor Quimby, Kang and Kodos, Maude Flanders, Bill and Marty, Dr. Hibbert, Roger Meyers, Jr., Sideshow Mel, Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, the Blue Haired Lawyer, Rainier Wolfcastle, Troy McClure, Groundskeeper Willie, Hans Moleman, Professor Frink, and Comic Book Guy.\nRatings.\nAfter the first season, Fox moved showings of \"The Simpsons\" from Sundays to Thursday so that more people would see it. It was to be shown on 8:00 PM, which started competition with \"The Cosby Show\". Producers of \"The Simpsons\" thought that the competition would make their ratings lower. In the summer of 1990, many news companies made stories about the competition. In this time, NBC had 208 television stations. Fox only had 133. \n\"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" (the first episode of the season) got almost the same Neilsen rating as \"The Cosby Show\". The episode got a rating of 18.4 and \"The Cosby Show\" got a rating of 18.5. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" was watched by 33.6 million people, which was more than the \"Cosby Show\". It was the most watched show on that week. In that time, it was the most watched episode on the Fox network ever. The next episode (\"Simpson and Delilah\") got a Nielsen rating of 16.2, and \"The Cosby Show\" got a rating of 18.5 again. \"Simpson and Delilah\" also had more people who watched it when it was first shown. \nThe 3rd episode (\"Treehouse of Horror\") did not get as many people to watch it as \"The Cosby Show\" did. After that, \"The Cosby Show\" had higher ratings than most of the other episode of \"The Simpsons\" 2nd season. \"Three Men and a Comic Book\" was the only episode of this season to get a higher Neilsen rating than \"The Cosby Show\" did. That episode was 23rd and \"The Cosby Show\" was 26th in the ratings for that week. \"The Simpsons\" did not get higher ratings again until in the 3rd season with the episode \"Homer at the Bat\". \"The Simpsons\" stopped showing on Thursdays in the 6th season.\nEpisodes.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}
{"id": "786007", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786007", "title": "The Book of the City of Ladies", "text": "The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cit\u00e9 des Dames (published in 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work. Pizan originally wrote Le Livre de la Cit\u00e9 des Dames in Middle French but it was later translated into English (1999). The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular \"Roman de la Rose\". Pizan combats Meun's statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are \"housed\" in the City of Ladies, which is an imaginary city from the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for the walls and houses of the city. Each woman added to the city adds to Pizan's argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for woman.\nSummary.\nPart I.\nPart I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus's Lamentations, a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage wherein the author writes that women make men's lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman. The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and tell her that she has been chosen by god to create a city for woman.\nPart II.\nIn Part II, Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine \"construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies\" and fill it with inhabitants who are \"valiant ladies of great renown\". As they build, Lady Rectitude tells Christine stories of powerful woman that will be housed inside the city. Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste, inconstant, unfaithful, and mean by nature through her stories. This part closes with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city.\nPart III.\nIn Part III, Lady Justice joins with Christine to \"add the finishing touches\" to the city, including bringing a queen to rule the city. Lady Justice tells Christine of female saints who were praised for their martyrdom. At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies. She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen (the Virgin Mary). She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers, saying, \"Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else: your chastity and your glorious good name\".\nA few women who were mentioned include:\nMedusa, Helen of Troy, Polyxena, Florence of Rome, Isabeau of Bavaria, Joan of Armagnac, Margaret of Bavaria, Isis, Marie, Duchess of Auvergne, Margaret of Burgundy, Duchess of Bavaria, Marie of Savoy, Countess of Saint-Pol, Anne de Bourbon and The Virgin Mary."}

It lives in northeastern Queensland.\nThe adult frog is 5.0 cm long. Unlike other male frogs, which can sing in groups, male Australian lace-lids are always at least 1 metre apart from each other when they sing. Scientists think that the males compete against each other for the females, that they are territorial animals.\nThis frog lives in rainforests, especially mountain rainforests. It will eat almost anything it can catch, usually invertebrates, for example spiders and insects. Its large eyes help it hunt at night.\nThe female frog lays eggs under rocks in streams where the water flows fast. The eggs are clear and 3.3 to 3.5 mm in diameter. The tadpoles have strong tails so they can swim in the fast water. The tadpoles eat algae on the bottom of the stream. Tadpoles that hatch early become frogs in 3-4 months. Tadpoles that hatch in the fall may stay tadpoles through the winter and become frogs the next year.\nScientists are not sure why this frog is endangered. One idea is that feral pigs have come to their rainforests and rip up the low plants that the frog likes to climb on and hide in. Another idea is that the fugal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing these frogs."}

A group of people would run these farms; they also owned the means of production (like the machines they needed), but not the land, which was owned by the state. \nThe state also ran farms during that time, which were known as Sovkhoz. These farms existed from about 1917, the date of the October Revolution, to 1991, when the Soviet Union was disbanded. In a Sovkhoz, people were employed, and did not own any means of production. \nAs a collective farm, a \"kolkhoz\" was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz is a model of cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a \"form of agricultural production cooperative of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on [...] collective labor\". It asserts that \"the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life\".\nThey imposed detailed work programs and nominated their preferred managerial candidates. Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes had been in effect an offshoot of the state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. As a result, many kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to \"sovkhozes\". The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev's administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter."}

The only living Wyoming toads are in captivity. For example, the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming breeds these toads. It was listed as \"endangered\" in 1984, and as \"extinct in the wild\" in 1991. There were suddenly far fewer Wyoming toads around 1975 and the toad extremely rare by 1980. To prevent extinction, a captive breeding program was started in 1989 at the Thorne Williams Unit. This program produced enough young toads in the first few years to send toads to seven different zoos. In 1998, the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery received toads to breed. Between 1995 and 2006, when the remaining captive toads were moved from the Thorne Williams Unit to the Red Buttes Environmental Biology Laboratory south of Laramie, nearly 46,000 offspring had been produced at the Thorne Williams Unit and released back into the wild. Before the sharp declines occurred, this toad was classified as a subspecies of the Canadian toad.\nIn nature, the female toad leaves her eggs in the shallow parts of ponds and lakes. The tadpoles swim in the warmest parts of the water.\nAdult frogs look for food during the day and hide at night. Sometimes they go into burrows dug by rodents. Adult frogs eat mostly ants but they also eat beetles and other animals without backbones.\nScientists are not sure why the Wyoming toad started to die out in the 1970s. They think it might have been that people were using an insect-killing chemical called Baytex, that seagulls, pelicans and raccoons were eating the toads, or that irrigation for hay growing changed their living space."}

It would have changed a law that was already there, the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Cap. 503) in relation to special submission arrangements and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Cap. 525). It would have changed the way the government of Hong Kong asked for people to be arrested in any other part of the People's Republic of China, namely mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan, with which it did not already have an existing law. The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was never passed.\nBackground.\nEarly in 2018, a 19-year-old Hong Kong resident was arrested in Taiwan for killing his 20-year-old girlfriend. He was tried in Taiwan because the government of Hong Kong had no way to extradite him, to formally ask the government of Taiwan to send him to them as a prisoner. Because of this, people started talking about Hong Kong's criminal law.\nIn February 2019, the government proposed a change to criminal laws. The law is meant to allow a the government of Hong Kong to arrest anyone suspected of a crime and send them to places where it does not already have a formal extradition treaty, such as mainland China, Macau and Taiwan.\nHowever, organizations like Amnesty International and many Hong Kongers saw that the law could also be used in another way. The law could allow the government to arrest almost any Hong Konger suspected of a crime and send them to be tried in mainland China instead of in Hong Kong. Mainland China has a reputation for unfair trials. They worried that the government would use this to arrest Hong Kongers who spoke against the mainland government and bring them to China as political prisoners and scare the people of Hong Kong.\nThe government stopped trying to pass the bill on June 15 and formally withdrew it on October 23, 2019.\nLegacy.\nThis bill was one of the reasons Hong Kongers protested in the 2019 Hong Kong protests."}

The researchers comment that only about 22,506 species of the half-million have been formally described.\nMost of the species are parasitic on other kinds of insect. They attack the egg or larval stages of at least 12 different insect orders. When that insect is itself a parasitoid, then the chalcid is called a hyperparasitoid. Chalcids are sometimes used to control crop pests. A few chalcids actually eat plants, and the most famous of these are the fig wasps.\nThere are 19 living families of chalcids."}

It is the smallest member of the genus \"Mustela\", the smallest member of the family Mustelidae and the order Carnivora. \nIt is also called the little weasel or common weasel. \nThe weasel is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the Falkland Islands, Argentina and Chile. It is a least concern species.\nDescription.\nThe least weasel has a thin, long and very flexible body. It has a small, long, head. The legs and tail are short. The feet have sharp, dark-coloured claws and a lot of hairs on the bottom. Its eyes are small when compared to their head size. Its eyes are dark colored.\nThe legs and tail are relatively short. The tail makes up less than half the body length.\nMales have an average length of long. Females have an average length of long. Males weigh . Females weigh .\nTerritorial and social behaviour.\nMale least weasels have territories that include many female territories. The number of least weasels in each territory depends on the amount of food and reproductive success. The male least weasel has a bigger territory during spring or when there is less food. It uses faeces and urine to mark its territory. The least weasel does not dig its own den, but stays in the burrows that other animals have left, like a mole or rat.\nBreeding.\nThe least weasel mates from April to July. The gestation period is 34 to 37 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the least weasel usually give birth to 6 kits. Kit is the name for baby weasels. The least weasel is able to reproduce by the age of three to four months.\nThe female takes care of its kits without help from the male. The kits weigh . Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf. They will have a white coat of downy fur at the age of four days. The first teeth come out at the age of two to three weeks. They start to eat solid food at that time.\nThe eyes and ears open at the age of at three to four weeks. By eight weeks they learn how to kill the animals that they eat. The young ones leave the family after nine to twelve weeks. Least weasels can live for seven or eight years.\nFeeding.\nThe least weasel mostly eats rodents, for example mice, hamsters, and gerbils. It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are almost never eaten. It can attack adult pikas and gerbils. Least weasels sometimes kill prey larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel grouse and hares. In England, the least weasel likes to eat the field vole.\nEven though it is small, the least weasel is a great hunter. It is able to kill a rabbit five to 10 times its own weight. Even though they are commonly eaten, the rabbits are usually young ones. Rabbits become a very important source of food during the spring, when there are few small rodents.\nPredators.\nRed foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecats, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards are predators of the least weasel. Owls are very good at catching least weasels. Some of the owls that hunt least weasels include barn owls, barred owls, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey that eat the least weasel include broad-winged buzzards and rough-legged buzzards. Some types of snake may eat the least weasel. They include the black rat snake and the copperhead.\nDisease and parasites.\nEctoparasites also target weasels. Common ones are different species of lice, mites and fleas. Very often, weasels get the parasites from the nests or burrows of their prey. Certain species of nematode also infect weasels.\nDistribution.\nThe least weasel lives in Europe, North Africa, Asia and parts of northern North America. It mostly lives in places where there are no stoats. It has become extinct from New York City. It has been introduced in New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azore Islands and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 off West Africa. It is found throughout Europe (but not Ireland). It is also found on many islands, including the Azores, Great Britain, and all major Mediterranean islands. It also lives in Honsh\u016b and Hokkaid\u014d Islands in Japan and on Kunashir, Iturup, and Sakhalin Islands in Russia.\nThe least weasel can be found in fields, open woodland, bushy or rocky places, parks and gardens. It can be found at altitudes of up to about .\nConservation status.\nThe least weasel is listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

At the end of World War II, the Gottlieb-Lea family, her husband Armin and their young daughters moved to Israel from Hungary. The decision to immigrate was tough, but the situation in Hungary in the post-war years left little choice for the Lea family. After arriving in Israel, the Leah Gottlieb family settled in a very small house located in the former Arab quarter. Lea and Armin started working right away. Lea continued to sew children's clothes, just as she did in Hungary. While this did not make the Gottlieb family much money, Lea continued to pursue sewing and design. She started to get involved in sewing when she was only six years old. Already in those years, many noted her talent and ability to create an original, unique design. Finally, her natural talent was shaped by the education she received in the specialty - fashion design. \nFashion career.\nWith money borrowed from family and friends, she and her husband opened a similar raincoat factory near Tel Aviv in 1949. \nAs a result, in 1956 they founded Gottex, a high-fashion beachwear and swimwear company that became a leading exporter, shipping to 80 countries.

{"id": "786684", "revid": "1068258", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786684", "title": "Bad Mojo", "text": "Bad Mojo is a computer game by Pulse Entertainment and Drew Pictures. It was made in 1996. In this game, an insect scientist named Roger is turned into a cockroach and must move through an old house back to his human body. On the way, he learns his landlord Eddie's big secret. It was released on CD-ROM. Vincent Carrella and Phill Simon made the game.\nGameplay.\nThis is an adventure game, which means the player explores the game world and solves puzzles. There is almost no fighting in this game. The player uses the arrow keys to tell the character where to go. Because he is a cockroach, he can only move himself and very small things. For example, the player can use a lit cigarette butt to burn up a spider that wants to eat the player.\nRoger can die by being killed by an animal or by getting stuck in one place for too long. For example, if the player makes Roger step in paint, he can be stuck. Like in arcade games, the player has \"lives\" meaning Roger can die more than once and still keep playing the game. \"Bad Mojo\" starts with five lives. The player can also save the game and come back later.\nTouching some things in the game starts a full motion video in which actors give clues.\nDuring the game, the spirit of Roger's dead mother, Angelina, can help the player. He can also talk to other cockroaches.\nAn experienced gamer can complete \"Bad Mojo\" in about an hour.\nStory.\nPart of the story for this game came from \"Metamorphosis\" by Franz Kafka. It is a famous story from 1915. In \"Metamorphosis\", a man called Gregor Samsa wakes up as a giant insect-like monster.\nIn \"Bad Mojo\", insect scientist Roger Sams has stolen one million dollars. He plans to run away with it. Roger's mother, Angelina, died before the game began. Before leaving with his stolen money, Roger touches a necklace that had been his mother's necklace. It is a magical necklace and it turns him into a cockroach and drops him in the sewer below the building. Roger's human body is still upstairs.\nRoger has a mean landlord named Eddie. Eddie keeps the building very dirty, so it is full of roaches, rats and spiders. Many of the puzzles the player solves are about sneaking past rats and other animals.\nThe game can end four different ways depending on whether only Roger lives at the end of the game, only Eddie lives, they both live or they both die.\nMusic.\nThe electronica group Xorcist made the music for \"Bad Mojo\". As of 2019, this music was available at Bandcamp.\nAnimals.\nRichard Cobbett of \"PC Gamer\" said \"Bad Mojo\" was \"easily the game with the most real-world kills to its name.\" The gamemakers used many real dead animals to make art for this game.\nFor one puzzle, the player has to sneak past a trapped rat without being eaten. The gamemakers put a real dead rat on a scanner to make the image. The gamemakers said the only reason they didn't do this with spiders was because the heat of the scanner would turn the spiders' bodies into gas. They also used many live cockroaches and a real dead catfish. They hired a professional cat trainer to manage the real cat, and this cat was not killed or harmed.\nThe gamemakers said \"We only harmed real animals that were on Death Row anyway.\" For example, the dead rat had already been killed by a restaurant owner.\nReviews.\nReviewers thought \"Bad Mojo\" was a very good game. Jeffrey Adams of \"GameSpot\" said it had a \"poignant story\" and \"best computer art you've ever seen in a game.\" \"Metacritic\" gave it #10 of the Best Games of 1996 and #9 for the Most Discussed Games of 1996.\nRedux.\nIn 2004, Pulse Entertainment released \"Bad Mojo Redux\". It is the same game and story as the original \"Bad Mojo\" but updated to run on newer computers. Some of the videos and acting were improved as well."}

It is also called the white or masked polecat. It is native to Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is a Least Concern species. It is generally light yellowish, with dark limbs and a dark mask across the face.\nDescription.\nMales are 320\u2013562\u00a0mm in length. Females are 290\u2013520\u00a0mm. Males may weigh up to 2,050 grams. For may weigh up to 1,350 grams.\nThe winter fur is soft and tall, with short, dense underfur and long, sparse guard hairs. The summer coat is shorter and coarser than the winter fur, and is not as dense and close-fitting, with a more strongly developed ochreous or reddish tone. The ears are completely white, while the throat is yellowish-white or almost white. Sometimes, the head is entirely white. The lower part of the neck is dark blackish-brown or brown, while the chest and front legs are black or blackish-brown. The abdomen is light, yellowish-straw in colour.\nBehavior.\nDuring warm seasons, especially in places with lots of ground squirrels. Old steppe polecats do not change territories until there are no prey in it's territory. Generally, the steppe polecat only lives one home range for a few days or up to a few months. In winter, the steppe polecat is more active, and will move 12\u201318\u00a0km a day. During heavy snowfall, the steppe polecat migrates to much better places, such as along the slopes of steppe ravines, near settlements and winter encampments.\nThe species does not usually dig its own burrow. Instead it uses those of marmots, ground squirrels, hamsters, moles, voles, jerboas and others, after making the burrow a little bit wider.\nReproduction.\nThe mating season is different in different regions. Usually, the steppe polecat mates once a year. The gestation period lasts from 36\u201343 days. The steppe polecat gives birth to three to six kits. But, the steppe polecat have been known to give birth to 18 kits.\nKits are born blind and naked. At the age of 20 days, the kits darken in colour. Their eyes open after 28\u201334 days. By the age of 45 days, they are able to hunt young ground squirrels. They start hunting adult ground squirrel at the age of 60 days. The kits stay in the family burrow for 2.0-2.5 months. The kits begin to leave the family from July or later. Steppe polecats reach sexual maturity at the age of 10 months. They become adults at the age of two years.\nFeeding.\nThe steppe polecat hunts large, mammals that live in the steppe such as ground squirrels, hamsters, pikas and young or injured adult marmots. Ground squirrels are the most abundant prey of the steppe polecat throughout the year. In warm seasons, they are hunted on the top of the ground. In autumn, they are dug from their burrows. Male polecats usually have to make the burrows of the ground squirrel to enter them. But, young or female polecats can easily enter them. In places where there are no ground squirrels, the steppe polecat mainly feeds on hamsters and pikas, or water voles on the banks of water bodies. Along the shores of rivers and lakes, fish, chickens and carrion may be eaten. Birds are sometimes killed by the steppe polecat. Amphibians and reptiles are rarely eaten.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nThe steppe polecat lives in Central and Eastern Europe, southern Russia, northern Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Mongolia and northern and western China. In 2014, it has been seen at an altitude of 5,050 m (16,570\u00a0ft) in Nepal."}

Other well-known Polynesian languages include M\u0101ori, Tongan, Hawaiian and Tahitian.\nHistory.\nThe Polynesian languages formed when Austronesians in New Caledonia (the Lapita culture) started moving to other parts of Oceania. Navigation of Oceania continued until 1300AD, with the discovery of New Zealand (Aotearoa) by the M\u0101ori people.\nToday, there are over 2 million Polynesians, although speakers of Polynesian languages number far less due to historical reasons such as disease and colonialism.\nSound changes.\nThroughout the Polynesian languages, many sound changes occur.

It is also called the Don Felipe's weasel. It is only known from the departments of Huila and Cauca in Colombia and nearby northern Ecuador. The Colombian weasel is only known from one Colombian weasel.\nIt only lives in riparian habitats at an altitude of 1,100 to 2,700 m (3,600 to 8,900\u00a0ft). There is lots of deforestation in the riparian habitats in the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. There is less than 10 known dead Colombian weasels that were studied. It is could be the rarest carnivore in South America. It is a vulnerable species.\nIt is the second-smallest living carnivore on average. The upperparts and tail are blackish-brown, while the underparts are orange-buff.\nThe first photo of a living Colombian weasel was taken in 2011 by an amateur naturalist who found one trapped in his parents' house; the weasel later escaped. The image was uploaded to iNaturalist in 2018. It gained widespread attention.\nDescription.\nThe Colombian weasel has a long body. It has an average length of 22\u00a0cm (8.7\u00a0in). Its tail is 11.5\u00a0cm (4.5\u00a0in) long. It weighs between 120 and 150 g (4.2 and 5.3 oz). The Colombian weasel has a dark dorsal color. It also has a light orange color. The bottom of the feet does not have any fur. It has webbed feet that is found on the second, third, and fourth toes.\nFeeding.\nThe Colombian weasel is a carnivore.

{"id": "786846", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786846", "title": "Long-tailed weasel", "text": "The long-tailed weasel (\"Mustela frenata\"), is a type of mustelid. It is also called the bridled weasel or big stoat. It lives in southern Canada throughout all the United States and Mexico, through all of Central America and northern South America.\nDescription.\nMales are 330 and 420\u00a0mm (12\u201316\u00a0in) long. Females are 280\u2013350\u00a0mm (11\u201313\u00a0in) long. In males, the tail is 132\u2013294\u00a0mm (5\u201311\u00a0in) long. In females, the tail is 112 to 245\u00a0mm (4\u20139\u00a0in) long. Long-tailed weasels weighs between 3 and 9 ounces (85-267 g) with males being about twice as large as the females.\nThe summer fur is brown, with whitish underparts and tinged with yellowish or buffy brown. The tail has a black tip. In northern areas, the winter fur becomes white, sometimes with yellow tints, but the tail still have its black tip. The long-tailed weasel moults two times each year, once in autumn (October to mid-November) and once in spring (March\u2013April). The bottom of the long-tailed weasel's feet has no fur in summer. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces, to mark their territory and, when scared, to scare predators away.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nThe long-tailed weasel lives in most of North America, south to Central America to northern South America. Long-tailed weasels have the largest distribution of any mustelid in the Western Hemisphere.\nLong-tailed weasels are found in temperate and tropical habitats in North and Central America. These habitats range from crop fields to small places with lots of trees to suburban areas. They are not found in deserts or thick forests. Their burrows and nests are in hollow logs, rock piles, and under barns. Sometimes instead of making a new nest, long-tailed weasels take the burrow of the animal they have killed.\nBehavior.\nLong-tailed weasels live by themselves except during the mating season. Long-tailed weasels do not like other long-tailed weasels to enter their home range.\nLong-tailed weasels are fast and agile. They are good climbers and swimmers. Long-tailed weasels hunt their prey by smell or sound.\nWhile long-tailed weasels can be active during the day, they are more active at night. These weasels are also known to be noisy animals, but this usually means that they are disturbed.\nFeeding.\nThe long-tailed weasel is a carnivore. It may attack animals far larger than itself. It hunts small animals, such as mice. It also hunts large animals, such as rabbits. Long-tailed weasels help to control populations of rodents and rabbits.\nThe long-tailed weasel likes its prey to be fresh or alive. It only eats the carrion stored in its burrows. Its mainly hunts animals such as mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, shrews, moles and rabbits. Sometimes, it may eat small birds, bird eggs, reptiles, amphibians, fish, earthworms and some insects. The long-tailed weasel has also been seen eating bats. It sometimes kill animals in big numbers, usually in spring when the kits are being fed, and again in autumn. Some of the surplus kills may be stored, but are usually left uneaten. When stealing eggs, the long-tailed weasel removes each egg from its nest one at a time. It carries them in its mouth to a safe place. It bites off the top and licks out the fluids in the egg. If they have babies in the burrow they may hold it in their mouth all the way back to them.\nPredators.\nThey may be hunted by larger animals, such as large owls, coyotes, or large snakes, such as eastern massasauga rattlesnakes.\nReproduction.\nThe long-tailed weasel mates in July\u2013August. The gestation period lasts 10 months. Long-tailed weasels give birth to 5\u20138 kits, which are born in April\u2013May.\nThe kits are born partially naked and blind. At birth, they weigh 3 grams. Long-tailed weasels grow fast. By the age of three weeks, the kits have lots of fur. They can crawl outside the nest and eat meat. At five weeks of age, the kit's eyes open, and the young become active. At this stage, the kits are weaned. The kits are fully grown by autumn. They leave the family at this time. The females are able to breed at 3\u20134 months of age. Males become sexually mature at 15\u201318 months.\nEconomic importance.\nThe fur of long-tailed weasels were available in the fur trade but were not a popular commodity. Long-tailed weasels are good at catching rats and mice, so farmers do not mind having weasels around their farms because they kill these pests. Long-tailed weasels are known to take poultry from poultry farms."}

The interchange was opened in 24 May 1972, and was given its popular name by local journalists.\nThe junction covers 30 acres, serves 18 routes and includes 4 km (2.5 miles) of slip roads. There are five levels, and it flies over two railway lines, three canals and two rivers. It took nearly four years to build it, against an estimated three years. It cost \u00a38 million, which is a deceptively small amount. It can only be understood by realising the extent of monetary inflation during the past half century.\nThe junction has had a lot of repair work done a number of times since it was built. There is very heavy traffic through the junction, and there were some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction."}

After qualifying as an airline captain, the company's video went viral. \nAnother fame wave came when she made history being the Captain of the first all-female-crew operating a flight from Tehran to the northeastern city of Mashhad.\nThe departing flight from the capital Tehran to Mashhad in northeast Iran was done with 160 passengers on Monday, and the return flight carried 171 passengers.\nCaptain Jahandari posted about the news on her Instagram page, describing it as a \u201chistoric event\u201d in Iran\u2019s aviation industry.\nLife story.\nPilot Neshat Jahandari became Iran's first female certified captain in July 2019. Awarded four stripes, she is qualified to take full control of an aircraft, either on her own or supported by a copilot. In an industry still largely closed to women in the Islamic Republic, this is a significant achievement.\nShe began to work with Zagros Airlines in the field of flight safety and the review of Flight Data Monitoring. About three and a half years later, the company needed a pilot; she passed the test and was accepted with merit.\nAt the age of 17, she began her pilot training classes, and at the same time studied at the University. She received her degree in Aviation Flight Engineering Technology.\nDue to her interest in this field, after receiving her license, she received all the flight-related documents for the airliners, such as the Commercial Pilot License and the Instrument Rating. Finally, her dream came true and she became a pilot.\nAlthough, there is no legal prohibition for women in the aviation field, entering into the profession has not been so easy for a woman.\n\u201cWhen I entered the pilot school, many were surprised and said this is a male profession and is not suitable for me,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis strange behavior could be a hindrance to me, but I believed in it and I was doing my job. I believe that everyone who does his/her best in every field, will certainly enjoy its result. In today\u2019s world, as we have male professional chefs, we also have successful female mechanics engineers. Success has nothing to do with gender. Of course, it\u2019s natural to be surprised to see a female pilot,\u201d she noted."}

Gameplay in adventure games is mostly exploration, solving puzzles and finishing stories. Some adventure games also have combat systems so the player can fight enemies like in an action game, beat 'em up or role-playing game, but many adventure games have no fighting in them at all. The first adventure game was \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" in 1975.\nIn adventure games, the player usually acts through a character in the story. This character sometimes has a history. For example Roger Sams in \"Bad Mojo\" is a sad insect scientist and Alexander in \"King's Quest VI\" is a prince trying to rescue a princess. Other player characters have almost no history. In \"Myst\" and \"Zork\", the game does not even give the player character a name. Other characters and the game's voice call the player \"you.\"\nAdventure games can be played on computers, for example PCs and Macs. Adventure games can be played on consoles, for example Playstations and Xboxes.\nMany adventure games are called point-and-click adventure games because the player uses a computer mouse to click on things on the screen. Not all adventure games do this. In the 1996 game \"Bad Mojo\", the player can only use the computer's arrow keys. In the 1977 game \"Zork\", the player must write commands using the keyboard.\nBecause they are about exploration, adventure games usually have an interesting world setting. Some games have art with painted graphics. Others show off the newest image-making technology, for example \"Myst\". Other games, like the early \"Zork\" games, had no graphics at all. The \"Zork\" games told the player what was happening using words.\nSome famous adventure game series are \"Myst\" by Br\u00f8derbund, \"Monkey Island\" by LucasArts, and the \"King's Quest\" and \"Quest for Glory\" series by Sierra on-line."}

They were joined by one of their great friends Absinto aka Gelmiro Pireza, who today takes on another position on the label and does all the design work at the production company. \nIn 2002, they began to gain some notoriety in their neighborhood, Bairro Mar\u00e7al, one of the peripheral areas of Luanda, due to the work they began to have with many artists in the area. \nBetween 2004 and 2005 they recorded songs and produced some of the Hits that marked a new era for Kuduro and generations. Among them the hit \"Comboio\" by Lambas, the instrumental produced by DJ Marcelo \"Esqueleto\", \"Se Desfio\" produced by DJ Satelite and other great themes like Dan\u00e7a Killa \"and\" Na Palma da M\u00e3o \", which were part of the first album dos Lamba entitled \"Staff of Ku-Duro\", which in 2006 sold 10,000 copies of physical CDs, this being, at the time, the first album in Angola to reach the mark of 10,000 copies sold in six hours. \nAfter the success previously made, in 2006 DJ Satelite, Bruno M and DJ Vamburgue, produced the album \"Batida \u00danica\", which was the affirmation of the new generation of Kuduro and where they completely changed the metrics of Kuduro. \nBruno M with his way of singing and creating, DJ Satelite and DJ Vamburgue meticulous in their choices about how the album could be, the three ended up doing a job with a lot of energy and success. \nAfter experiencing many adventures in Kuduro, in 2008 DJ Satelite decided to leave the room for the world, and embarked on other waves looking for a focus for his career and new steps for his production company Seres Produ\u00e7\u00f5es. \nThat's how he decided to upgrade Kuduro to Afro House, and launched his first work of its kind in 2012. \nWith the growth of the label and the arrival of new artists to the house, there was a need to start publicizing all these arrivals to the world, and it was in 2014 that he started his journey through the digital world, more specifically the digital distribution through the various sales platforms. and streaming around the world. \nIts presence in the world of Afro House, became a growing success, as it had already happened in the world of Kuduro, and with that it could not be different its structure that had always been strong and aligned.

Batter is used mainly for pancakes, light cakes and as the coating for some fried foods. The word \"batter\" comes from a French word \"battre\". \"Battre\" means beat. Many batters require vigorous beating or whisking in their preparation.\nA number of batters are made by combining dry flour with liquids, like eggs, milk and water. Often, a leavening agent such as baking powder is included to fluff up the batter while it cooks. The mixture may be naturally fermented for this actual purpose, as well as to add flavor.\nThe viscosity of batter may be from very 'heavy\" to \"thin\". Heat is applied to the batter, often by frying, baking or steaming in order to cook the ingredients and to \"set\" the batter in a solid form.\nBeer batter.\nBeer is a popular ingredient in batters used to coat food before frying. One reason is that a basic batter can be made from flour, beer and some salt. The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add lightness and body to the batter. The practice of beer battering is popular in several countries, including the United States, Iceland, Germany and Australia."}

There were also some African American performers and black-only minstrel groups that formed and toured.\nMinstrel shows parodied blacks and African Americans as happy-go-lucky, lazy and dim-witted.\nMinstrel shows came out as brief burlesques in the early 1830s in the Northeastern United States.

It is also called the Russian mink and Eurasian mink. It is native to Europe.\nDescription.\nThe European mink has a very long body with short limbs. The European mink has a large, wide head with short ears. The mink's tail is short. Males are 373\u2013430\u00a0mm (14.7\u201316.9\u00a0in) long. Females are 352\u2013400\u00a0mm (13.9\u201315.7\u00a0in) long. The tail is 153\u2013190\u00a0mm (6.0\u20137.5\u00a0in) in males. It is 150\u2013180\u00a0mm (5.9\u20137.1\u00a0in) in females. It weighs 550\u2013800 grams (1.21\u20131.76\u00a0lb). It is a fast and agile animal. It is great at swimming. It is able to run along stream beds. It can stay underwater for one to two minutes.\nThe winter fur, is very thick and dense. The fur is not long. The summer fur is a little bit shorter, hairier and less dense than the winter fur. In dark coloured European minks, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown. Lighter European minks are reddish brown.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nEuropean minks are found in Northeast Spain and France and throughout Europe to the Irtysh and Ob Rivers.\nThe European mink lives in densely shaded banks of fresh water creeks, rivers, and lakes. The European minks may make their own burrows. They may live in the burrow of a water vole. They may live in cracks among root of trees.\nFeeding.\nThe European mink eats different animals that lives in aquatic and riparian habitats. Voles are the most important source of food for the European mink. It also eats crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands. When there is a lot of food, it stores its food.\nReproduction.\nThe mating season happens from February to March. The gestation period is 35\u201372 days. The kits are given birth to in April and May. They give birth to three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about 6.5 grams (0.23\u00a0oz), and grow fast. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30\u201331 days. The kits suck milk for 2.0 to 2.5 months, even though the kits eat solid food after 20\u201325 days. They follow their mother to hunt by the age of 56\u201370 days. They leave the family at the age 70\u201384 days.\nConservation status.\nEuropean mink populations have been decreasing because of ecological and commercial reasons. They are now listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The main reason is capturing them for their fur. Another reason for the decline is water pollution and hydroelectric dams. Efforts to bring European minks to the Kuril Islands and Tajikistan have begun."}

It releases mostly (but not all) mainstream music, and it has had many popular Croatian musicians of many music genres such as Dra\u017een Ze\u010di\u0107, Arsen Dedi\u0107, Mi\u0161o Kova\u010d, Josipa Lisac, Goran Bare, Te\u0161ka industrija, Thompson, Maksim Mrvica, Crvena jabuka, Jelena Rozga, Novi fosili, Op\u0107a opasnost, Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija, Jacques Houdek, Parni valjak, Lete\u0107i odred, Mladen Grdovi\u0107, Dino Dvornik, Dino Merlin, Hari Ron\u010devi\u0107, Adastra, Radojka \u0160verko, Klapa Sveti Florijan, Giuliano, Dje\u010daci, Mate Buli\u0107, Disciplin a Kitschme, Srebrna krila, Divlje jagode, Bosutski be\u0107ari, Indexi, Sinan Alimanovi\u0107, Lu Jakeli\u0107, Mia Dim\u0161i\u0107, Mia Negoveti\u0107, Nina Donelli and others. Today, Croatia Records claims to have a 70% share of the Croatian music market and has 30 record stores. Being a successor of Jugoton, from which it gained a very large audio and video collection, Croatia Records is also active in re-releasing numerous digitally remastered former Yugoslav pop and rock titles. During the global retro trend, the company decided to re-introduce gramophone records as well.\nHistory.\nThe company that is today Croatia Records was founded in 1947 in Zagreb, the capital of the then-People's Republic of Croatia under the name Jugoton, a publicly owned company which was the largest record label and chain record store in the former SFR Yugoslavia. Jugoton signed many popular Yugoslav artists such as: Indexi, Bijelo Dugme, Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, Haustor, Idoli and Leb i Sol, and also many popular foreign stars for the Yugoslav market including: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode etc. The company also owned a chain of record shops across Yugoslavia. Many Yugoslav entries in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton, like the 1989 winners Riva.\nCroatian independence.\nAfter the change from socialist state to parliamentary democracy in 1989, the question of Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia was raised. In 1991, shortly before the declaration of Croatian independence and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the company's name Jugoton, a portmanteau word of \"Jugoslavija\" (Yugoslavia) and \"tone\", was changed to Croatia Records. Parallelly, the major labels in Serbia and Slovenia such as PGP RTB and ZKP RTLJ were renamed to PGP-RTS and ZKP RTVS. The company was now owned by the independent Republic of Croatia, but since socialism had ended, it was sold off to private owners. Since the year of 2000, Croatia Records is ran by professionals from the music industry who are in the partnership company called AUTOR d.o.o. (limited company). In 2001, the musician Miroslav \u0160koro became the leader of Croatia Records, until his resignation in 2006.\nCroatia Records Music Publishing.\nCroatia Records Music Publishing (CRMP d.o.o.) is a company owned by Croatia Records d.d. that works in the managing of rules for the use of copyrighted music and its digital sale.\nFounded in 1947 as part of Jugoton, today Croatia Records Music Publishing is its own company. Croatia Records Music Publishing has the largest catalog of Croatian songs and the largest catalog of master recordings made in the last 40 years of the most famous Croatian singers such as Arsen Dedi\u0107, \u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107, Damir Urban, Nenad Nin\u010devi\u0107, Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 - Gibonni, Zdenko Runji\u0107.\nControversy.\nOften, the company was a target of public complaint on various issues.\nCroatia Records has been the object of an issue raised by singer Branimir \u0160tuli\u0107 over royalty rights. \u0160tuli\u0107 claims that the royalties of songs by former rock band Azra, of which he was the lead singer in the 1980s, and which was then managed by Jugoton. \u0160tuli\u0107 has named a sum of 12 million Euros that he thinks Croatia Records owes him, but he has not tried to take legal action to claim it. \u017delimir Babogredac said in response that Croatia Records has all the legal rights to release titles by \u0160tuli\u0107 and Azra, as the company is a direct successor of Jugoton, whom these artists were signed for. He also said that the sum \u0160tuli\u0107 claims is too large. However, he added that Croatia Records is proud to have the very popular \u0160tuli\u0107 in the list of its artists and that he may receive a payment from the sale of audio CDs only if he joins the Croatian Composers' Society - ZAMP."}

The members of the band, aside from him, are Tomislav Mandari\u0107, Ivan Ivankovi\u0107, Duje Ivi\u0107, and Ivica Bili\u0107 Ike.\nThe band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perkovi\u0107 while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although mostly formed in \u010cavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to be popular during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single \"Bojna \u010cavoglave\", which is about the Croatian participation in the Yugoslav Wars and was included in the compilation album \"Rock za Hrvatsku\". This song, with slightly different lyrics, named \"Branitelji Sarajeva\", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo (\"Sarajevo zaboravit ne\u0107e nikada\"). During the 1990s Thompson became popular in Croatia with the release of the first album \"Moli mala\" in 1992. They later became popular again with the hit \"Prijatelji\" in 1998. \nIn 2002, Thompson started their first major tour to promote the album \"E, moj narode\". This tour continued on and off until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\", again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States.\nThompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of \u010cavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 viewers, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Buli\u0107, Dra\u017een Ze\u010di\u0107, Ivan Mikuli\u0107, and Baruni. The band has became controversial for its alleged praise of the World War Two Nazi-affiliated Usta\u0161e regime in their songs and concerts."}

Genovese syndrome is when witnesses to a crime to not report a crime because they are scared and they believe that others will report it instead which in the end they do not and the crime goes unreported. \nHowever, this is not really what happened. Police interviews showed that the other people nearby either attempted to call the police or were afraid to be involved. This was before calling 911 was easy to do in the United States. Because Genovese was killed late at night, many of the people nearby were asleep. Some of the people who saw the attack also saw Genovese get up and walk away, so they did not think she had been badly hurt.\nWinston Moseley, a 29-year-old man from Manhattan, was arrested during a house burglary six days after the murder. While in custody, he confessed to killing Genovese. At his trial, Moseley was found guilty. He died in prison on March 28, 2016."}

Its purpose is to help alcoholics quit drinking and help people stay sober. AA gives men and women a place to come together and share their experiences, recover from alcoholism and maintain sobriety. Its concept revolves around that premise that alcoholism is an illness that can be managed, but not controlled.\nAA was founded by Bill Wilson and his physician, Doctor Bob Smith in 1935 and eventually grew to include two more groups by 1939. That same year, Wilson published Alcoholics Anonymous, a text which explained its philosophy and methods. We know it today as the 12 Steps of recovery. Over the years, the 12 Steps have been adapted by other self-help and addiction recovery groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, to those struggling with other forms of addiction. Additionally, many groups have changed the explicitly Christian overtones of the original 12 Steps to reflect more secular or agnostic philosophies."}

The money needed to make the game came from Kickstarter. It first came out on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Microsoft Windows. It later came out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, OS X, and Linux. The game's gameplay and looks are based on other 2D platformers from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).\nThe game has received many good reviews, has won many awards, and often shows up on best video games of all time lists. The game is even responsible for expanding the indie game market for Nintendo consoles. Before \"Shovel Knight\", Nintendo mostly released first-party and mainstream video games on its own consoles, but since the Wii U was struggling to sell, it allowed Nintendo to be more open to playing indie games on their own consoles. \"Shovel Knight\"'s success on Nintendo's consoles them more popular to make indie games for.\nThe game later added four more campaigns, or separate stories and/or game modes within the game, which are \"Plague of Shadows\", \"Specter of Torment\", \"King of Cards\", and \"Shovel Knight: Showdown\". These all were sold together as \"Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove.\" The first campaign was later renamed \"Shovel of Hope\".\nGameplay.\nThe play plays as Shovel Knight, a knight who carries a shovel rather than a normal weapon like a sword or a spear. The player will use the shovel for fighting enemies, jumping on platforms, and digging up treasure and secrets. There is no game over if the player dies in a level, but they will return to the last checkpoint they turned on and lose about one-fourth of all the Gold they have, the game's currency. Like in \"Dark Souls\", the player will have one life to take back the Gold they lost, but if they die before taking back their lost Gold, the lost Gold will disappear forever. The player can destroy checkpoints to get more Gold, but in turn, the player will have to start at an earlier part of the level if they die. At the end of the main levels, the player will have to fight a boss, usually an enemy knight, to complete the level.\nGold is used to make the player's armor and shovel better, buy more health or magic, or buy Relics (useful items that use magic). Most of the main levels (the levels that have an level-end boss and are needed to complete the story) have a Relic hidden in the level that the player can buy. Relics can help with platforming, protect the player, or help the player fight enemies.\nThe game has a game world similar to that of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" where the player can play some levels in an order they want, but must complete certain levels before they can unlock more parts of the game world. Also like \"SMB3\", there are some bosses called the Wandering Knights who can walk around the game world, and they will start a boss fight if you walk into them. There are main levels, levels that teach the player how to use a Relic, and towns similar to those in ' and '. In towns, the player can shop for upgrades and Relics, and talk to villagers for tips on how to play the game.\nPlot.\nThe game's story begins with Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, who is Shovel Knight's partner and love interest. When they went to the Tower of Fate to take a magical amulet, Shield Knight disappears. Afterwards, Shovel Knight mourns the loss of Shield Knight and retires from being a knight. This leaves the land defenseless and allows an evil sorceress called the Enchantress and a group of evil knights called the Order of No Quarter to take over the land. Shovel Knight then comes out of retirement to defeat the Enchantress and the Order and save the land.\nAfter every knight of the Order Shovel Knight defeats, he sleeps by a campfire. Sometimes, he dreams of catching Shield Knight falling from the sky while fighting off enemies. \nAs Shovel Knight travels the land to defeat the Order, he sometimes meets and fights his rival, Black Knight. Black Knight is not part of the Order, but he wants to protect the Enchantress, who Shovel Knight later discovers to be Shield Knight. She became the Enchantress because she was being controlled by the evil amulet from the Tower of Fate.\nDuring Shovel Knight's fight with the Enchantress, Shield Knight is set free from the amulet's control, but the amulet takes on a stronger form. Shield Knight then helps Shovel Knight fight the amulet. However, the amulet hurts Shovel Knight badly and Shovel Knight passes out. Before the amulet could kill Shovel Knight, Shield Knight blocks its attack with her shield. Black Knight then shows up and warns Shield Knight to escape, but she tells him she must destroy the amulet even if she must die doing it. Shield Knight requests Black Knight to take safely Shovel Knight out of the tower. Black Knight does not want to save Shovel Knight, but he obeys Shield Knight because of his own love for her. As the tower is falling down, Black Knight places Shovel Knight by a campfire. As Shovel Knight is sleeping, the cutscene that Shield Knight survives the fight with the amulet. The game ends with a hurt Shield Knight slowly walking towards the campfire and lying next to a sleeping Shovel Knight."}

These are some of the ways:\nPlants have ways they may get clones of the parent plant. Any piece of a plant \"may\" be used to grow a whole plant. This is called vegetative reproduction. \nThese are all natural methods of vegetative reproduction.

He is considered the first person against military service in Italy.\nLife.\nHe was born in Finale Ligure, from Sardinia. Pinna lived in Ferrara when, at the end of 1948, he was drafted. Becoming strongly anti-militarist after experiencing the horrors of the Second World War, and influenced by the thought of Aldo Capitini, he decided to refuse to serve as a military service, going down in history as the first conscientious objector of Italy for political reasons.\nAfter a trial for disobedience (art. 173 military criminal code of peace ) , he was sentenced to prison for a first time for ten months, and then for another eight. At the trial he was defended by the lawyer Bruno Segre , who will become one of the most famous Italian defenders in the field of conscientious objection. \nThanks to the echo given by Capitini to his disobedience, the case took on international significance. Pinna received a telegram of support from the First Lagy Wilson and the daughter of Leone Tolstoy, Tatiana Tolstoy Suhotin , wrote that she had \"cried with joy reading what these brave young people are doing\". In addition, twenty-three British parliamentarians, chaired by the Labor Reverend Reginald W. Sorensen, signed a letter addressed to Prime Minister De Gasperi to intercede on his behalf .\nPinna later became one of Capitini's closest collaborators, with whom he organized the first Perugia-Assisi March for Peace in 1961. He continued to work in the nonviolent movement throughout his life, becoming national secretary from 1968 to 1976. He was editor in chief of the magazine \"Nonviolent Action\" until his death, which occurred on April 13, 2016.\nHe risked jail for his nonviolent actions. On 17 January 1973, former secretary of the Nonviolent Movement , following a posting against the celebration of the Armed Forces on 4 November (\"Not a party but mourning\"), he was arrested in Perugia and sentenced for direct contempt of the Armed Forces. Following the demonstrations that took place in his support in various cities, he was freed four weeks later at the request of clemency by the President of the Republic Giovanni Leone .\nIn April 1979 he was sentenced by the Court of Appeal of Trieste to an 8-month prison sentence for a roadblock, a sentence which was later pardoned .\nHe was among the organizers of the Catania-Comiso March (24 December 1982 - 3 January 1983) to protest against the installation of the US missile base, the first concrete action of nonviolent struggle against military installations in Italy.\nIn 2008 he was awarded the National Nonviolence Award .\nIn 2012 the Faculty of Law of the University of Pisa awarded him an honorary degree in Peace Sciences .\nPietro Pinna died on April 13, 2016 in Florence."}

He is also an imam (religious leader) at the Hyde Jamia Mosque and the founder of Rawdhatul Ilm Institute in Hyde. In 2016, Dr. \u010cedomir Nestorovi\u0107 named him as one of the most influential Muslim singers as he was one of the first faith-based Muslim singers to sing in English.\nEarly life.\nUddin was born on 28 June 1984 in England. He grew up in Hyde, Greater Manchester. His Bengali Muslim parents, Haji Malkas Ali and Sufia Ali, migrated from Sylhet in Bangladesh. Uddin has two brothers; Faisal and Kaz Uddin who are also songwriters.\nUddin started his studies at Greenfield Primary School and then went to Hyde Technology School. In summer 1996, he went to Al-Jamia Al-Islamiyyah in Bolton, and studied a course to learn the entire Quran (Muslim holy book) off by heart. In early Ramadan 1421 (November 2000), his dad collapsed during a night time prayer session (Tarawih) and passed away whilst saying the Shahadah (Islamic testimony of faith). At the end of 2001, Uddin finished his course and became qualified. In September 2002, he began studying in Jamia Al-Karam in East Retford to learn Arabic grammar.\nCareer.\nUddin began his career as a teacher and Imam at Hyde Jamia Mosque in 2004, teaching the Quran and nasheeds (faith-based acapella songs) to children. \nIn January 2005, Uddin and his mother performed the Hajj pilgrimage. Returning from Hajj, Uddin's debut album \"In the Name of Allah\" under Noor Media, was released in August 2005. In December of the same year, he performed at the first Global Peace and Unity event in the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London.\nIn May 2006, his second album \"Illallah\" was released under IQRA Promotions.

Uddin also released a \"The Nasheed Class CD\" which featured vocals from his students. On 6 August 2007, he performed at \"The Nasheed Festival 2007\".\nOn 13 January 2008, Uddin went to Rotherham to perform at the \"An Evening of Islam\" event. In September 2008, after winning the Islam Channel Nasheed Contest presented by Rakin Misbah from Mecca2Medina, Uddin performed at the Global Peace and Unity event on 25-26 October 2008 as Nasheed Artist of the Year. He performed in a December charity event in Victoria Hall in front of the Mayor of Keighley.\nIn April 2009, he was invited to perform in Yvonne Ridley's Gaza event in Rochdale. He then travelled to Toronto in March to perform at the 4th Annual North American Qira'atul Qur'an &amp; Hifz Competition. Uddin returned to Rochdale in October and November to perform at Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy's event \"The Legacy of the Forgotten Generation\". Uddin was invited on 11 October 2009 to the Taunton &amp; Somerset Eid Party.

After appearing at the Peace Conference Scandinavia hosted by Norway, Uddin travelled to his motherland Bangladesh where he also performed in May 2011.\nUddin then returned to studying, partaking in an \u02bfAlimiyyah course at the Oldham Islamic College. Following a 12-year gap in new releases, Uddin returned to the scene in late 2018 for a charity track with Omar Esa, Imtiyaz Sidat, Hafiz Mizan and Ehsaan Tahmid. In 2019, he toured South Africa and shot two nasheed videos at the Nizamiye Mosque with Imtiyaz Sidat, Hafiz Mizan and Ehsaan Tahmid under IlmFeed. \nIn early 2020, he signed to Free Voice Records. By August 2020, he founded the Rawdhatul Ilm Institute in Hyde where he is an instructor.\nDiscography.\nAlbums.\n\"In the Name of Allah\" (2005).\n\"In the Name of Allah\" is Uddin's debut album, which was released in August 2005 via Noor Media and recorded in Glass Onion Studios, Birmingham. It was produced by Tahir Rashid and illustrated by Rizwan Hussain of Digital Dawa. The album starts with him reciting the Adhan; the Muslim call to prayer. It then moves on to three hamds; the first of which is inspired by Hasan ibn Thabit's poetry, two nasheeds about Muhammad, and a nasheed about the Quran. The last track included a remix of a 13th-century Madih nabawi from Saadi Shirazi's Gulistan.\n\"Illallah\" (2006).\n\"Illallah\" was Uddin's second album, which was released in May 2006 via IQRA Promotions and recorded in Denton Studios, Manchester and Digital Image Studios, Chesterfield. It was produced by Ahmad Hussain and Ahmir Hussain and illustrated by Rizwan Hussain of Digital Dawa.

An official video was filmed for his title track \"Illallah\", written by his brother Faisal Uddin.\nAlbum 3.\nIn 2010, Uddin was invited to Ummah Channel where he announced that he was working on a third album with his label IQRA Promotions. He performed a snippet of \"Mujhe Bhi\", an upcoming Urdu track. However, Uddin took a break from nasheeds for 8 years since then. In early 2020, he signed to Free Voice Records after 10 years of being an independent artist. On 4 March 2021, Uddin posted some pictures and a video performing harmonies with the caption: \"Back in the studio and working on a new nasheed \u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\"."}

Her name is also spelled Bartman or Bartmann. She showed signs of Steatopygia; which means she had a lot of fat in her buttocks. Around 1810, she was brought to Europe. She was one of at least two Khoikoi women, who were shown at freak shows. In English she became known as Hottentot Venus. At the time, people believed there were different races of humans. Hottentot was the term used to refer to the Khoikoi people, as a race. Today, many consider it to be racist. \nFrom about 1810, Baartman performed for upper-class people in London. She danced, sang and played an instrument, called Ramkie. The Ramkie is a kind of lute with 3 or 4 chords that was popular in South Africa at the time. The African Institution, led by Zachary Macaulay offered to bring Sarah Baaerman back to South Africa, but she declined. It is unknown if she was put under pressure, or if she declined because in South Africa her people were persecuted (much like a modern-day genocide). She may also have liked the performances. There was a court hearing, done in Dutch; there she said that she wasn't forced to do anything. She also said that she had been promised half the earnings from her show. \nThe court hearing had drawn too much attention, and she could no longer perform in London. Hendrick Caezar, her manager at the time, moved to the English countryside, with his \"freak.\" Reverend Joshua Brooks baptized her on December 1, 1811, in a church in Manchester. In 1814. she came to Paris with another manager. There, mostly scientists were interested. She was presented to the audience, mostly of doctors and scientists, in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris. Professional portraits were done. She died, presumably of pneumonia, on December 29, 1815. \nGeorges Cuvier prepared her corpse: The skeleton, the brain, and her genitals were preserved. A gypsum plaster model was made of her body. All of these are preserved in what is the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris, today.\nStephen Jay Gould and \u00c9lisabeth de Fontenay pointed out that these exhibitions were sexist, and focused on their own people (\"ethnocenric\"), in 1982. President Nelson Mandela asked that the remains of Sarah Baartman be given back to South Africa. At first, French academics refused. It was only in 2002, that her remains were given back. There was a large funeral in \"Hankey\" at the River Gamtoos in the area of \"Baviaanskloof\", on 9. August 2002. Thabo Mbeki, who was the president of South Africa at the time, gave the funeral speech. The district Cacadu, where her grave is was renamed to Sarah Baartman, in her honor, in 2015."}

But other times the wolf is symbol for something else. There are two main ways to look at symbols in \"Little Red Riding Hood\": In one, the girl Riding Hood is a symbol for the sun. She is eaten by the wolf, who is a symbol for winter or night. Little Red Riding Hood escaping from the wolf's belly is like the sun rising again the next day or spring coming again the next year. In the other, the wolf represents sex or rape. In French around the time \"Little Red Riding Hood\"' was written down, the figure of speech \"she has seen the wolf\" means \"she has had sex and is not a virgin any more.\"\nIn other things.\nThere are also modern versions of the Big Bad Wolf. For example, in the graphic novel series \"Fables\", Bigby Wolf lives with other fairy tale characters who have run away to the real world and works as a detective."}

It lives everywhere on the island except high in the mountains. It lives in both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, no more than 1500 meters above sea level. It also lives in Queensland, Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef, but some scientists think these are really two different species. Scientists who think they are one species call the frogs in New Guinea and Australia \"Litoria genimaculata\" and scientists who think they are two different species call the New Guinea frogs \"genimaculata\" and the Australian frogs \"serrata\". Some scientists think the group of frogs in Australia is really two different species, \"serrata\" and \"myola\", for three altogether.\nThe adult male frog is 4.6 cm long and the adult female frog is 7.1 cm long. Each frog has a bright green ring around its eyes, which is why it is called \"green-eyed tree frog\" in English. It has a brown-green body with patches of color that look like lichen that grows on wet rocks. That way, the frog can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. The frog has very large discs on its toes for climbing. This frog has a bit of skin on its hind legs that looks like fringe. That is why it is also called \"fringed tree frog\" in English.\nThis frog lives near streams with rocks in them. The male frogs tend to stay near the water, and the female frogs climb high into the trees. The female frog lays eggs in pools, many hundreds at a time.\nThis frog has colors that look like an hourglass on its back. Scientists thought they could take photographs of this frog to identify individual frogs, but the hourglass changes shape as the frog grows older.\nThis frog is not endangered now, but scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis or a virus may have killed many of them."}

As of 2013, there were about 190,000 American citizens who said that they had Serb ancestry. However, the number may be much higher, as there were also 290,000 people who said that they were Yugoslavs living in the United States. The group includes Serbian Americans living in the United States for one or many generations, people who are citizens of both Serbia and the United States, or any other people who say that they are both Serbian and American.\nHistory.\nOne of the first Serb immigrants to the United States was the settler George Fisher, who came to Philadelphia in 1815, moved to Mexico, fought in the Texan Revolution, and became a judge in California. Another important early Serb in America was Basil Rosevic, who started a shipping company, the Trans-Oceanic Ship Lines, around the year 1800. In the early 1800s, many Serb sailors and fishermen from Montenegro and Herzegovina came to New Orleans looking for work. In 1841, Serbs founded the Greek Orthodox parish with Greek immigrants in New Orleans.\nSerbian Americans fought in the American Civil War, mostly on the side of the Confederacy, as most Serbs living in America were in Louisiana and Mississippi. A few Confederate military units were started by Serbs in Louisiana, such as the Cognevich Company (named for Stjepan Konjevic, who immigrated to Louisiana in the 1830s), and the First and Second Slavonian Rifles. At least 400 Serbs fought in these three units during the Civil War. Several other known Serbs who fought in the Civil War came from Alabama and Florida, specifically from Pensacola.\nSome Serbian Americans went back to Serbia to fight in the First Balkan War. During World War I, as many as 15,000 Serbian Americans went back to the Balkans to fight. Serbs in the United States who did not fight in the war raised knowledge, campaigned for the creation of Yugoslavia, sent aid to the Balkans through the Red Cross, formed a Serbian Relief Committee, and urged important Americans to support the Serbian cause.\nAfter World War II many Serbs immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia after Josip Broz Tito took control of the country. Since then, many Serbian American organizations have been formed in the United States. A number of Serbian American engineers worked on the Apollo program.\nAlaska.\nSerbs have lived in Alaska since the first Serbs came to America in the 19th century. Many Serbs came in the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s to earn money, just like they had done in the California Gold Rush.\nThe places where most Serbs settled in Alaska were Juneau, Douglas, Fairbanks, and Sitka. Many Serbs also settled in the Canadian Yukon during the gold rush as well, such as the legendary gold miner Black Mike Vojni\u0107.\nIn 1893, Serbian miners in Alaska built the Orthodox Church in Juneau with the native Orthodox Tlingit people, who had been converted to Orthodoxy by the Russians decades before. During the First World War, many Serbian Americans went back to Serbia to fight, and thousands of them came from Alaska.\nIn recent years, it has become common for Serbian workers to come to Alaska every year to work for a few months in canneries, where food and living space is given to them. These workers stay in Alaska on temporary work visas, and speak English.\nPopulation.\nDemographics.\nIn the past, number of Serbs who immigrated to the United States was difficult to find as Serb immigrants were often recorded by their country of origin, so as Turks, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians and Austro-Hungarians. In the 1910 census, there were 16,676 Serbs from Austria-Hungary, 4,321 from Serbia, and 3,724 from Montenegro.\n187,738 citizens of the United States said that they Serb ethnicity in 2010. The 2012 American Community Survey estimated that there were 199,080 Americans with Serb ancestry. It is likely that some of the American citizens who said that they had Yugoslavian ethnicity (328,547 in 2010; 310,682 in 2012 estimation) are also ethnic Serbs.\nPlaces in the United States where many Serbs have settled include Chicago, New York City, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and Jackson, California.\nSerbian-born population.\nSerbian-born population in the US since 2010:"}

They are commonly known as fruit bats or flying foxes. They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia: Australia, the Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and some oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. \nThere are at least 60 living species in the genus.\nFlying foxes eat fruit and other plant matter, and occasionally insects as well. They find food with their keen sense of smell. Most, but not all, are nocturnal. They navigate with keen eyesight, as they cannot echolocate. They have long lives and low birth rates. Females of most species have only one offspring each year. This slow birth rate makes their populations vulnerable in present-day circumstances.\nLike other bats, flying foxes can give deadly diseases to humans. They are the reservoirs of rare but fatal disease agents such as Australian bat lyssavirus (which causes rabies), and Hendra virus. Seven known human deaths have come from these two diseases. Nipah virus is also transmitted by flying foxes\u2014it affects more people, with over 100 fatalities. \nFlying foxes have cultural significance to indigenous people. They appear in traditional art, folklore, and weaponry. Their fur and teeth were used as currency in the past. Some cultures still use their teeth as currency today."}

For example, a person cannot usually say, \"I have three gasolines\", since gasoline is not easy to count. However, a person can measure how much gasoline there is or count how many containers are used to hold gasoline. In other words, people can say, \"I have three gallons of gasoline\", \"I have three liters of gasoline\", or \"I have three tanks of gasoline.\"\nIn English, count nouns are their own measure words. A person can say \"I have three cars\" or \"cars have four wheels\". The nouns do not need any extra words because the nouns themselves are easy to count. Measure words can also be used to describe groups of countable nouns. For example, a group of cattle is called \"a herd of cattle\" and a group of fish is called \"a school of fish.\"\nIn many East Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, measure words must be used to count both mass nouns and count nouns. Unlike in English, a person cannot simply say \"three cars\" or \"four wheels\" in Chinese. The nouns in both phrases need a measure word. In Chinese a person must say \"three (vehicle) car\" (\u4e09\u8f86\u8f66) and \"four (thing) wheel\" (\u56db\u4e2a\u8f6e)."}

{"id": "788505", "revid": "1138038", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=788505", "title": "Trolley problem", "text": "The trolley problem is an imaginary problem that people can solve to explore how the human mind works.\nMost people think that the trolley problem was invented by Oxford University philosophy professor Philippa Foot in the 1960s, but it might have been someone else. Foot wrote about the trolley problem and other problems in her 1967 essay \"The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect.\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Judith Jarvis Thomson made the trolley problem famous. Now many schools teach the trolley problem. For a while, there was even a part of philosophy called trolleyology. Jarvis Thomson named the problem \"the trolley problem.\"\nThe trolley problem does not have a right or wrong answer. Instead, it is a way to make people think and talk about what makes actions good or bad and why.\nHow it works.\nThe agent (\"you\") is on a trolley, a fast-moving cart that can only run on a track. It is not an automobile that can be driven off the edge of a road. It must stay on a track. Ahead of the agent, five people are standing on the track, where the trolley will run over them and kill them. The agent has no way to stop the trolley. The only thing the agent can do is throw a switch to make the trolley change onto a different track. On this second track, there is one person. None of the six people have time to move out of the way.\nIn Jarvis Thomson's version, the person controlling the trolley switch is not on the trolley. Instead, this agent is watching from the side. This person can throw the switch but they can also choose to do nothing.\nIf the agent does nothing, the trolley will kill five people. If the agent throws the switch, the trolley will kill one person.\nVariations.\nThere are different versions of the trolley problem. What if the agent knows something about the individual people on the track?\nEmergency room case.\nThe agent is a doctor working in an emergency room. A homeless person or traveler comes to the emergency room, but the doctor learns he is not sick at all. Upstairs in the hospital, there are five sick people who need organ transplants. The homeless person is a perfect match for all five. Like in the trolley problem, the doctor can kill one person by taking action or allow five people to die by doing nothing. The emergency room case was also in Foot's 1967 essay.\nMost people think the emergency room problem is different from the trolley problem, even though the numbers are the same. The trolley problem is something that could happen in real life but would be very rare. Healthy people going to emergency rooms every day.\nIn the emergency room problem, many, many things can affect the agent's decision. The students say things like, \"The agent is a doctor, and doctors are taught not to hurt or kill people, so the agent will say no\" instead of saying what they themselves would do. Or they would say things like \"If the doctors kill the homeless person, people will find out about it. They will be worried that the doctors will kill them for their organs, so they will not go to the emergency room when they need to. Then more than five people will die\u2014sick people who did not go to the emergency room for help.\" These things are true, but they mean the emergency room case is very complicated for a thought experiment.\nFootbridge case.\nPhilosophers invented the footbridge problem as a better version of the emergency room problem. Unlike in the emergency room problem, there are no societal systems that get in the way, for example the doctor's education or people deciding not to go to the emergency room.\nIn the footbridge problem, the agent is standing on a small bridge over a trolley track. Again, there is a trolley with no brakes heading very fast toward five people. It will hit and kill the people if nothing stops it. They cannot get out of the way. There is also a second person on the footbridge. If the agent pushes this one person off the footbridge, then their body will stop the trolley, saving the five other people. But the one person whom the agent has pushed will die. In this problem, the person the agent would push is big and fat enough to stop the trolley, but the agent is not.\nOthers.\nOther variations on the trolley problem include when the agent knows some or all of the people on the tracks. Another is when the big fat person on the footbridge put the five people on the track on purpose so they would be run over. Another is when the one person whom the trolley can run over instead of the other five is a person taking a nap in a hammock instead of someone standing on a trolley track.\nIn the brain.\nA team of scientists led by Joshua Greene put people in an fMRI machine to watch what their brains did while they thought about the trolley problem and its other versions. When people thought about pulling the trolley switch to kill one person instead of five, the parts of the brain that do cool, rational thinking (the prefrontal cortex) lit up. When people thought about pushing a fat man onto the track, the parts of their brain that do emotion (the amygdala) lit up. The people decided not to push the fat man onto the track. Greene and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make moral decisions using intuition when they are feeling emotions, for example the disgust they feel at the thought of killing an innocent fat man. Green and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make decisions using logic when their emotions are not involved.\nIn popular culture.\nThe trolley problem appeared in the episode \"The Trolley Problem\" on the second season of the sitcom \"The Good Place\".\nReferences.\n\"Nick is the best person ever\""}

Shibboleths have been used throughout history in many societies as passwords. They are simple ways of self-identification: they signal loyalty and affinity.\nOrigin.\nThe term comes from the Hebrew word \"shibb\u00f3let\" (), which means the part of a plant containing grain, such as the head of a stalk of wheat or rye. \nThe modern use comes from an account in the Hebrew Bible. How this word was pronounced was used to distinguish friend from foe. In the Book of Judges, chapter 12, the inhabitants of Gilead inflicted a military defeat on the invading tribe of Ephraim (around 1370\u20131070 BC). The surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the River Jordan to their home territory, but the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them. \nTo identify and kill the Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word \"shibboleth\". The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like \"sibboleth\". In the King James Bible: \nThe concept of a shibboleth is still with us. It is any word, phrase, jargon or pronunciation which identifies a person as a member of a particular group."}

He climbed this peak thirty-third times, and the last time was in 1904 when he was 70 years old. He loved it so much that he wanted to become owner of it. In 1888, he asked the prefect, who granted him a concession for 99 years. The price was 1 franc per year. Also he dug near the top 7 caves to stay in during the summer and to invite his friends. He organized several banquets in these caves with a lot of famous people. The last cave is (The cave of Paradise).and it is only 18 meters under the top. Today we can still see these caves above the glacier of Vignemale."}

Very few of these turtles are alive today: Human beings know about only four. It is one of the most endangered animals in the world.\nWhat was the last known female Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle died in a Suzhou zoo in China in 2019. Another female was found in Vietnam in October 2020. Scientists tested her DNA and then put her back in the lake.\nThis leaves four turtles alive: One male turtle living in Suzhou Shangfangshan Forest Zoo, the female turtle in Dong Mo Lake in Vietnam, perhaps another one in Dong Mo Lake, and another one in Xuan Khanh Lake in Vietnam. Scientists don't know whether the Xuan Khanh lake turtle is male or female. Scientist Tim McCormack thinks the two lake turtles became trapped when people built dams on their rivers. Scientists say there might be more in other lakes and rivers. Some scientists have gone on boats to look for them.\nDescription.\nThis turtle is very big with a pointy noise that it can use to breathe while keeping most of its body hidden underwater. Scientists do not know much about the way it acts in the wild because there are so few left. It is the largest turtle that lives in fresh water instead of sea water. It has a long, flat body. It can weigh 150 to 220 kilograms (330 to 485 pounds).\nThe female can lay 30 or 40 eggs at a time, more than once each year.\nNatural range.\nThe Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle used to live in the Red River in China and in many parts of Vietnam in the flood plain from the Yangtze River. It became endangered because humans built roads, buildings and dams where the turtle likes to live and because of pollution. It also became endangered because people would catch the turtle to eat it and its eggs and to sell turtles as pets. Illegal hunters also catch the turtle to sell its body parts as ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine. \nMythology and legends.\nIn Vietnamese culture, the Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle stands for Kim Qui, the Great Turtle God. There is a story of the Dragon King giving a special sword called Heaven's Will to a Vietnamese hero named Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i used Heaven's Will to free Vietnam from the Chinese. When it was time for Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i to give Heaven's Will back to the Dragon King, he gave it to Kim Qui to give to him.\nConservation efforts.\nIn 2007, scientists found a female Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle in a zoo in Changsha. The turtle had been there for more than fifty years, before Yangtze giant soft-shell turtles became rare. The people in the zoo knew she was a large, female turtle but not that she had become one of the rarest on Earth. The deputy director of the zoo was attending a conference about tigers and went to the speech about turtles for fun. He saw they were talking about the same kind of turtle as the one in his zoo.\nThe people in Changsha knew they had a large turtle in their zoo, but they didn't know it was a Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle. A circus performer had sold her to the zoo in the 1950s. They fed her raw meat, which kept her in good health, but it was not good for making eggs. She laid eggs every year, but they never hatched. This was because no male turtle had fertilized them, but also because she needed to eat foods with more calcium.\nWhen people found out the Changsha turtle was a female Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle, they did not bring her to Suzhou right away. Both cities wanted the other turtle brought to them. Turtles are important symbols of living a long time in China, so the people of Changsha did not want to give her away. Eventually, the two zoos agreed the female should come to Changsha and that they would divide up and share the baby turtles. In 2008, the female was moved from the Changsha Zoo to Suzhou Shangfangshan Forest Zoo.\nThe first year, the female turtle laid many eggs, and about half of them were fertilized. None hatched. Some of the eggs had very thin shells. The zookeepers realized that there was not enough calcium in the food the turtle was eating, so they fed her different foods with more calcium. Then they realized that visitors to the zoo were throwing food and garbage into the turtle's lake even though there were big signs saying not to.\nThe other problem was that the male turtle's penis had been damaged in a fight with another male turtle years earlier, so he could not have sex very well. Starting in 2015, the zookeepers collected the male turtle's male reproductive liquid and placed it inside the female using medical tools. Again, the female turtle laid eggs, but none hatched. The scientists used a different medical technique every year, trying to find one that worked. In 2019, the female turtle died because she did not wake up from the medicine the zookeepers gave her to make her sleep during the medical process. The zookeepers cut out and froze tissue from her female reproductive organs."}

{"id": "789083", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=789083", "title": "The Sims Bowling", "text": "The Sims Bowling - mobile game in the series \"of The Sims\", developed by EA Games for devices iPod and later mobile phones. The game was released on July 18, 2007. The game itself is a reworked version of the successful 2004 JAMDAT Bowling bowling simulator . \"The Sims Bowling\" combines a life simulator with a bowling game, where the player must collect points by playing bowling in different game modes in order to set up their home and buy bowling equipment.\nCritics have given mixed opinions about the game, on the one hand they praised \"The Sims Bowling\" for its high-quality graphics and varied gameplay, but criticized the game physics, especially behavior of pins, called it outdated, but the gameplay is not deep enough\u00a0. \nGame process.\nThe game begins with the player creating a male or female character, choosing a suitable hairstyle and clothing for him. The controlled Sim then comes to the bowling alley to compete against other NPCs. Control is carried out in the first person, the player determines the location of the ball and with what force he should throw it. The ultimate goal of the player is to win with a score of 300.\nThe game also introduces the so-called life goal, in particular the sim dreams of becoming the star of the bowling alley, the sim's aspiration level increases with the player's skill. There are also four different game modes in \"The Sims Bowling\" : Classic - a casual bowling game, Strike-o-thon - which counts how many hits the player can hit, and Spare-o-thon - the same for the substitutes. The player can also practice, this mode allows you to develop a strategy for solving difficult situations, such as, for example, 7-10 splits. The player can also compete with another player in the Pass' n Play mode, passing in turn the phone to make a move . There is also a \"Bowl Now\" mode, which instantly introduces a random opponent into the game with multiplayer support, for example, in devices such as the LG VX8100 or Samsung M610. The iPod version is only compatible with 5th generation devices .\nWith the funds received, the player can buy new clothes or new bowling equipment purchased at the store in the alley. These are new balls, bowling gloves, and so on. As the Sim becomes a regular customer over time, the store owner will even give him some tips. As your Sim succeeds on the lane, they will be endowed with various privileges, such as getting a better paid job and then being able to invest in additional equipment for bowling . The player can, among other things, visit his home and furnish it with new purchased items, such as a widescreen TV, an air hockey table or a dance floor. The game also features familiar characters from other \"The Sims games\", such as Don Lothario. \nCreation and release.\nEven before the creation of the game, in 2004 the game JAMDAT Bowling enjoyed great success in the mobile market, which was then acquired by Electronic Arts . It was expected that this would make the game even more famous, but it disappeared from sales, nevertheless EA released its modified version with updated graphics and additional gameplay on top, also linking with the \"The Sims\" brand. Back then EA Games expressed an interest in adapting \"The Sims\" for iPods, with the developers arguing that \"The Sims Bowling is a game that reflects the character of The Sims while being an elaborate bowling game for the iPod.\"\nThe official announcement of the iPod game took place on July 12, 2007. The game has positioned itself as a combination of a life simulator and bowling, allowing you to spend the money you receive on different equipment and playing in different modes. The game was available for purchase in the games sections of iTunes. Then it became known that the game was developed specifically for the fifth generation iPod.\nThe game was released on July 18, 2007. Despite the mixed assessment of critics, users generally rated the game positively. It eventually became the sixth overall released for the iPod and is remembered as one of the first games released for this platform .\nIn August 2008, it became known that Electronic Arts had entered into a contract with Handango, Inc., the world's leading provider of mobile games, to distribute its mobile games, including \"The Sims Bowling\" . The game was available for symbian devices with support for English, French, Italian, German and Spanish.\nCriticism.\nPeter Cohen, a Macworld critic, noted that before the iPod was only arcade or puzzle games, \"The Sims Bowling\" turned out to be a different game, and more than just bowling with \"The Sims\" . Despite the apparently simple concept of the game, it still remains a life simulator as its name suggests. The reviewer even argued that bowling is not the most difficult part of the game, since the player will eventually get used to the controls, it will not be difficult for him to play and he will defeat any rivals without any problems . The critic also praised the game for its graphics and music quality. The game has its own and pleasant soundtrack, as well as the ability for the player to choose what he wants to listen to, or even turn it off. In general, the critic called the game a combination of a life simulator with bowling, an enjoyable, but not too difficult game.\nA critic of IGN saw a clear resemblance to JAMDAT Bowling in the game, \"The Sims Bowling itself is\" actually a remaster of the 2004 game. In the end, as a critic has noted, the game engine in the game feels outdated. The reviewer also pointed out that the combination of bowling and \"The Sims is\" also implemented strangely, on the one hand, the critic praised the game for the fact that it allows you to create and customize a character, but the aspiration system ceases to bring any meaning over time. The game loaded very slowly on Sony Ericsson W810 . Although the game's design and graphics are good, the game experience is spoiled by the poor physics of pins falling. Nevertheless, the critic ended up giving 7 points out of ten, praising the game for the presence of different modes and multiplayer mode, and even despite the outdated engine, it pleasantly surprises with its graphics and functional gameplay.\nA more restrained review was left by Chris James of the Pocket Gamer website, who noted that not all games of the high-profile franchise, like films, can be considered successful. This can be seen in the example of the quite successful \"The Sims 2 Mobile\", and the unsuccessful The Sims 2 Pets Mobile and the same \"The Sims Bowling\" . Not that one would come to that conclusion at first glance, as the game is quite up to EA quality and standards. The visuals turned out to be quite brilliant and neat animations, and the critic praised the game for its control. However, the problems start with in-game physics, which gives the impression that the ball is rolling on the sides, rather than rolling forward, and after changing the camera perspective, it seems that the ball is flying almost at the speed of a bullet, and the pins also fall very quickly. This annoyed the critic very much, he noticed that the imperfection of physics led even to bizarre incidents, such as pins spinning on the floor through other pins, or they could even bounce. The reviewer also noticed that there is no real competition in the game, and the purchased items just aren't enough motivation to keep the player interested. The critic summed up that undoubtedly the game will be downloaded by many avid \"The Sims\" fans \"for show\", but the game is not worth its name and the critic advised instead to play Midnight Bowling ).

It lives in Queensland.\nThis frog lives in rainforests near the Barron River and east to the Mirray River. Some of these frogs also live near the Broken River.\nThe adult male frog is 3.1 to 4.8 cm long and the adult female frog is 4.4 to 7.1 cm long. This frog is light brown with darker brown marks. Some males turn partially yellow during the time of year when they try to attract females. The front feet have no webbing and large discs for climbing.\nIn some places, this frog digs a small basin to lay eggs in. The tadpoles stay in this basin until they become frogs. The frog digs the basin in sandy ground where the sunlight comes through the trees. The frog digs the basin close enough to a stream for water to seep through the sand into the basin. In some species, a male frog digs a basin to impress a female so she will mate with him, but scientists think male jungguy frogs attract a female first and then dig the basin.\nScientists used to think this was the same frog as \"Litoria lesueuri\"."}

Even if the result seems to be random, the process can be predicted.\nThis near random process is important to online security. Because the result can be predicted, it is important that the \"seed,\"(or first input) and the process are kept hidden.\nHistory.\nThe creation of random numbers has many uses, mostly in statistics, and simulations. Before computers, researchers that needed random numbers would get them from dice, cards, roulette wheels, etc, or by random number tables.\nThe first attempt to crate a large amount of random numbers was in 1927. This was when Cambridge University Press put out a list of 41,600 numbers made by L.H.C. Tippett. In 1947, the RAND Corporation created random numbers by simulating a roulette wheel using a computer. The results were published in 1955 with the title of, \"\"A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates\".\"\nUnpredictability as \"near random\".\nBy using radioactive substances with radioactive decay, or by tuning a radio between stations, near random numbers can be created for short amounts of time. The time needed to get these numbers led to a change. This was using these generated numbers as a \"seed\" instead of a result. The less numbers created by this process, the more random the result would seem. Another compromise is to combine the timings between keystrokes of multiple people.\nPeople's actions have been proven to be useful for Multi-factor authentication. Also, studies have shown that pseudo random numbers can sometimes be predicted. This becomes more difficult when in small amounts.\nIn computational complexity.\nIn theoretical computer science, a distribution (set of numbers) is considered to be pseudorandom if it is similar enough to other sets. This idea of pseudorandomness is studied and has importance in cryptography."}

It features the work of over 200 creators, each making a single short part of the film.\nFormat.\nAs a recreation, \"Shrek Retold\" has the plot of the original film with only a few changes. The biggest difference between \"Shrek Retold\" and the original film is the strange ways each creator made their scene. As a group effort with over 200 creators, the art style, voice acting, and music change from scene to scene, and are usually very different from the original. Unlike the original \"Shrek\" which is completely 3D animated, \"Shrek Retold\" is made with 2D and 3D animation, live action, stop motion, and other methods. The film's creators include many internet personalities and actors, such as David Liebe Hart, Michael Cusack, Ratboy Genius, Anthony Fantano, Noah Munck, KC Green, Jamie Loftus, Doug Lussenhop, and SiIvaGunner.\nProduction and release.\n\"Shrek Retold\" was made as group effort, although each creator made their part of the movie on their own. Director Grant Duffrin separated the film into scenes of different length, then each scene was remade by a creator. In an interview with \"Quartz\", Duffrin said his love of \"Shrek\" was real, not like the \"ironic\" \"Shrek\" internet memes that were popular at the time. Soon before the film's release, a trailer for the film was uploaded to the 3GI channel which was talked about by many news outlets. The film was first shown on YouTube to a live audience on November 29, 2018, and is still on the site. On November 29, 2019, 3GI announced that the film would be able to be purchased in VHS format and as a free digital download. In March 2020, \"Shrek Retold\" was followed up by \"Sonic Rebuilt\", a similar recreation of the 1999 \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" film.\nReception.\n\"Shrek Retold\" was received well by reviewers, who mostly complimented its impressive scope for a fan creation and its strange content."}

The British army of 85,000 men was led by Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, while the Japanese regiment of 36,000 men was headed by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Japan captured the British naval base in Singapore, built as a protectionary agent for dominions in the Pacific. Japan defeated the inadequate forces at Singapore, allowing the Imperial Japanese forces to move further south in its war against the Allied powers. The defeat of the \"Singapore Strategy\" meant that thousands of British and Australian POW's were taken.\nAt the beginning of December 1941, on the same day that Japan was attacking Pearl Harbour half a world away, the Japanese simultaneously bombed the Royal Air Force bases to the north of Singapore on the Malay coast, thereby eliminating the Air Force\u2019s ability to either retaliate or protect the occupying troops on the ground. Their tactics were shrewd and incredibly well thought out. Before a Japanese soldier set foot on Singaporean soil, Britain\u2019s naval and aerial capabilities had both been destroyed.\nThe worst defeat in the history of British arms, the Battle of Singapore and the preceding Malayan Campaign saw Percival's command suffer around 7,500 killed, 10,000 wounded, and 120,000 captured. Japanese losses in the fighting for Singapore numbered around 1,713 killed and 2,772 wounded. While some of the British and Australian prisoners were kept at Singapore, thousands more were shipped to Southeast Asia for use as forced labor on projects such as the Siam\u2013Burma (Death) Railway and Sandakan airfield in North Borneo.\nMany of the Indian troops were recruited into the pro-Japanese Indian National Army for use in the Burma Campaign. Singapore would remain under Japanese occupation for the remainder of the war. During this period, the Japanese massacred elements of the city's Chinese population as well as others who opposed their rule."}

Subsequently, Klimova often performed on the screen and stage the role of a lover or a wife with her second husband, actor Igor Petrenko (\"We are from the future 2\", \"Dreams from plasticine\", \"Moscow windows\", \"Sins of the fathers\", \"Cancellation of all restrictions\"), and among the costs of the acting profession, she regretfully mentioned that \u201c \"you have to lie in bed with some stranger and pretend love\" \u201d. \nKlimova played in the films \" Storm Gates \" and \" Antikiller D. K. \", in the TV series \" Poor Nastya \", \" Escape \", \" Boiling Point \". One of the most memorable was the role of the nurse Nina Polyakova, played by Klimova in the dilogy \"We are from the future\" (films \" We are from the future \" and \" We are from the future 2 \"). In this film, Klimova sang the romance \" \"Thank you for everything, good friend ...\" \" to the poems of Elizabeth Stewart , which became widely popular and very soon turned out to be prophetic for the actress. The timbre of Klimova's voice was assessed by musicologists as soft, velvety, unusually warm. In 2012, to the vocals of Klimova and the music of Ivan Burlyaev (including a rap fragment), figure skaters and former spouses Tatyana Navka and Alexander Zhulin performed a nostalgic dance of memories as part of the television show \u201c Ice Age. Professional Cup \". \nIn 2012, in the alcoholic-romantic comedy \"Date\" directed by Yusup Bakhshiyev, Klimova appears as a sexy teacher, a very teetotaler, \"clever and beautiful woman with long legs from under a small fuchsia dress.\" The observer of the Gazeta.ru publication drew attention to the inability to tempt the heroine of Catherine with palaces and diamonds, noted the actress in the scene of rental on a motorcycle across all Moscow, lying on a frame with her back and with outstretched legs. The film itself is rated as an epigonic eclectic with a set of disparate, impressive episodes based on the American film Blind Date (1987) with Bruce Willis and the prototype of Klimova performed by Kim Basinger. \nIn 2013 she played one of the main roles - a successful and successful TV presenter in the film \"Season Icon\". Klimova's character is a typical glamorous inhabitant of glossy worlds, idly wandering from one fashionable party to another, but rapidly transforming with the appearance of a real strong feeling in life. \nIn 2013-2014, she starred in Lviv in the adventure spy series by S. Ginzburg \" Wolf Sun \", which, based on historical events, takes place in the early 1920s on the border of Soviet Ukraine and Poland.

According to critics, Klimova piercingly and authentically conveyed the inner essence of the frustrating character of Raisa Peterson; The strong side of the image of a young, but already experienced seducer in a duet with the romantic Nikita Efremov was the unbridled passionarity characteristic of the actress, the burning play of the eyes, sensual sign language and almost ballet plasticity. In the scene of the officers' picnic, Ekaterina performed a rarely-heard romance by E. St. George's \u201cWhy love, why suffer? \u201d, However, the operatic heights of Klimova this time did not submit. \nFrom April to August 2014, Catherine in St. Petersburg starred as the maid of honor Anna Vyrubova in the historical series directed by Andrei Malyukov \u201c Grigory R. \", Based on documentary evidence about the life of Grigory Rasputin . When creating an artistic image of a lady-in-waiting, who is neither internally nor externally similar to herself, an important acting task for Klimova was not to distort the fate and character of the real person, who left a mark on the chronicles. The script for the film was based, in particular, on the diaries of Klimova's character, Anna Vyrubova. In the frame, Catherine wears genuine 19th-century shoes, her dresses and costumes were sewn according to old patterns. The most valuable, historically convincing acting works of the film, embodying the strength and indomitability of the Russian spirit, are recognized as the roles of Klimova and the \u201cSiberian elder\u201d ( Vladimir Mashkov ), permeated with passion and dramatic intensity ( Vladimir Mashkov ). \nIn the second half of 2014, Klimova starred in Ukraine in the melodrama Women in Love and the battle drama According to the Laws of War, which takes place during the German invasion of Kiev in the summer and autumn of 1941, the actress plays the role of a special department investigator ...

A love story in the epistolary genre, which began at the age of 8, mosaically passed through youth and maturity, but in reality it was never realized. \"I give myself \"to\" you \"at a distance\", everything, without cuts ...\". As of 2019, an entreprise performance, performed once a month in different cities of Russia, is sold out. \nKlimova calls her favorite director Andrei Malyukov, who entrusted her with such diverse roles as nurse Nina (\"We are from the future\"), Anna Vyrubova ( TV series about Rasputin ), Raisa Peterson (TV series Kuprin ). However, critically it noted that the choice of roles for Catherine is based primarily on the exterior attractiveness of the character, and when required to \"\"jump out of the trench, crawling under bullets and undermined by a mine\",\" then the performance stunts Klimov duplicates professional kaskadorsha. \nThe initial prototype, \"secretly involved\" in the gallery of roles of fatal, insidious and seductive women played by the actress, Klimova called the image of Milady from \"The Three Musketeers \". \nAmong the actors who influenced her, Ekaterina especially singles out Vladimir Mashkov, Ingeborga Dapkunaite, Andrey Smolyakov. \nIn an interview in 2015, Klimova regretted that she had not become an actress of the festival cinema.

Its polymers are the main component of natural rubber.\nNatural occurrences.\nIsoprene is produced and emitted by many species of trees (major producers are oaks, poplars, eucalyptus, and some legumes). Yearly production of isoprene emissions by vegetation is around 600 million metric tons, half from tropical broadleaf trees (that is, flowering plants) and the rest mainly from shrubs. \nThis is about the same as methane emissions. It accounts for about one-third of all hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere. In deciduous forests, isoprene makes up about 80% of hydrocarbon emissions. Microscopic and macroscopic algae also produce isoprene, but much less than trees.\nIsoprene emission may help trees use to combat stress. In particular, isoprene does protect against moderate heat stress (around 40\u00a0\u00b0C). It may also protect plants against large fluctuations in leaf temperature. Isoprene is built into cell membranes and helps membranes keep stable.\nIsoprene produces the blue haze which gives the Blue Ridge Mountains their name. "}

In Tulu Nadu (Coastal Karnataka), it is known as \"chende\". It is greatly identified as a cultural element in Kerala.\nSound.\nThis instrument is famous for its loud and rigid sound. A Chenda has two sides, the left side called \"Edamthala\" (\u0d07\u0d1f\u0d02 \u0d24\u0d32)(Left Head) and the right side \"Valamthala\" (\u0d35\u0d32\u0d02 \u0d24\u0d32)(Right Head). The \"Edamthala\" is made of only one/two layer of cow skin and the \"Valamthala\" will have a five/seven layer skin, so as to have a bass sound. The skin are dried in the shade and fastened on wooden rings (Chenda Vattam, \u0d1a\u0d46\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f \u0d35\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d02) made of the trunk of a locally available palm tree (Eeranpana) or bamboo, using a gum prepared from the seed of a tree called \"pananchi maram\". The circular frame is kept in a vessel, boiled for an entire day and then bent in the form of circle and dried. The body of the Chenda which is 1\u00a0ft in diameter and 1.5\u00a0inches thickness is made of the soft wood of the jackfruit tree (\u0d35\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 \u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d) (Varikka Plavu). The thickness is again reduced by 0.25\u00a0inches, at simultaneous points separated by 4\u00a0inches. This is done in order to produce highly resonating sound. Only the wooden rings with the skin (Chenda Vattam) is replaced once the quality of the sound is not up to the mark. For regular Chenda artists an average of 15 rings are required every year.\nUsage.\nThe Chenda is mainly played in Hindu temple festivals and as an accompaniment in the religious art forms of Kerala. The chenda is used as an accompaniment for Kathakali, Koodiyattam, Kannyar Kali, Theyyam and among many forms of dances and rituals in Kerala. It is also played in a dance-drama called Yakshagana (Tenku Thittu) which is popular in Tulu Nadu in Karnataka. There is a variant of this instrument used in northern school of Yakshagana called Chande. It is traditionally considered to be an \"Asura Vadyam\" ((demonic instrument)) which means it cannot go in harmony. Chenda is an inevitable musical instrument in all form of cultural activities in Kerala.\nMaking.\nIn Kerala the craft of making Chenda is now associated with some few \"Perumkollan\" (smith) families at Peruvembu, Nemmara, Lakkidi, Vellarkad and Valappaya villages. Many famous Chenda percussionists in Kerala make their Chendas from Vellarkad village for it is famous for the quality of the instrument."}

Archaeologist Helmut de Terra discovered it in February 1947. It is at least 10,000 years old. Even though it is called the Tepexan \"Man,\" the skeleton is that of a woman. The skeleton was found lying face down with the arms under the chest and the legs drawn up to the stomach. The body most likely sunk into the mud surrounding it, leaving the shoulder, back, and hips exposed, which might explain why those elements are missing. It is possible that the body was originally put in a lake.\nAnalysis.\nAge.\nThe deposits of the area where the skeleton was found dated the site where Tepexpan Man was found to about 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Near the skeleton, there were the remains of five mammoths. They could be associated with obsidian flakes. Therefore, it was originally believed that Tepexpan Man dated to about 10,000 years ago. However, years later, researchers looked at the skeleton again and dated the remains using radiocarbon methods. It was then found to be closer to 2,000 years old. Dr. Silvia Gonzalez, a professor of geoarchaeology at John Moore University in Liverpool, used uranium isotope analysis to date the skeleton. Results showed that Tepexpan Man was 4,700 years old. She argues that contamination of the remains led to the wrong radiocarbon dates. Other critics have claimed that Tepexpan Man was an intrusion in that he was buried at a later date but dug into Pleistocene materials.\nAn analysis of Tepexpan Man that was published in the 1947 issue of The Science Newsletter claims that the individual was at least 40 at the time of death. This was determined by \"united seams in the skull\" (referring to sutures), and fused epiphyses in long bones.\nSex.\nIn his first report, Helmut de Terra claims that \"The other bones, in conjunction with the skull, indicate that the person was of male sex.\" Based on DNA analysis, a Mexican archaeologist has proposed that Tepexpan 'man' was actually a woman.\nTrauma.\nTepexpan Man has a healed fracture on his right ulna. De Terra thought that due to this fracture and the proximity to mammoth fossils, Tepexpan Man may have been a hunter who was either killed by his fellow men or mortally wounded while hunting. The Science Newsletter claims that the individual suffered from a stiff neck due to the many limy deposits on the cervical vertebrae. This means that Tepexpan Man most likely suffered from arthritis.\nOther.\nThe Science Newsletter described Tepexpan man in its 1947 edition. It described Tepexpan Man as having \"a high-domed, thin-walled skull\" which contained \"a brain the same size as those of present-day Indians.\" The writers described a \"solidly built\" jawline and \"prominent\" brow ridges, as well as a \"sharply prominent chin\" which would separate him from earlier Neanderthals. Tepexpan Man only had three teeth left in his upper jaw. In his lower jaw, all of the molars had disappeared before his death. This was evidenced by the alveolar sockets being healed and smoothed over in the mandible. What was left on the mandible included incisors, \"eye-teeth,\" and premolars that were worn but still in decent condition.\nEnvironment of Lake Texcoco.\nDr. Gonzalez also reconstructed the environment of Lake Texcoco around the time of Tepexpan Man by analyzing sediments and fossils from the area. With her team, she analyzed sand, clay, and volcanic ash, as well as fossils of diatoms (microscopic algae) and ostracods. Ostracods are small crustaceans. When Tepexpan Man was alive, the lake was very deep, full of fish, and surrounded by trees. The environment surrounding Lake Texcoco changed a lot over the past 20,000 years: There were several volcanic eruptions. Water levels, and several types of vegetation also changed. These environmental changes clearly affected populations living in the area. Today, Lake Texcoco has almost dried up. It is on the northeast outskirts of Mexico City.\nAMS radiocarbon dates of the sediments at Tepexpan show ages between 19,110\u00b190 and 612\u00b12214C years BP. New uranium-series date the skeleton to 4,700\u00b1200 years BP, which would indicate a Holocene age. The evidence suggests that there were large changes around Lake Texcoco in terms of the balance between water and land plants, C3 and C4 plants, saline, alkaline and freshwater conditions, volcanic activity, reworking of lake sediments, and input from the drainage basin throughout the late Pleistocene and late Holocene. These changes also had large effects on the prehistoric human populations living around the lake at this time."}

It was a group of five singers who came together to make two albums, groups of songs sold together. The Traveling Wilburys were Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne. They made two albums: \"The Traveling Wilburys: Volume 1\" and \"The Traveling Wilburys: Volume 3\". \"Rolling Stone\" said Volume 1 was one of the 100 best albums of all time.\nBeginning.\nThe Traveling Wilburys started in 1988. The international department at Warner Brothers Records asked George Harrison to write a B-side song for his single, \"This Is Love\". In vinyl records, there is one song (or group of songs) on the top of the disc, and then the user can pick the disc up, turn it over, and have the record player play music on the bottom of the disc. The top is called the A side and the bottom is called the B side. In the late 1980s, most record companies sold single records with a famous song on the A side and a new song on the B side. Harrison wrote \"Handle with Care\" to be the B-side for \"This Is Love\". Because some of Harrison's friends were there keeping him company, they decided to sing \"Handle with Care\" together. The record company decided \"Handle with Care\" was too good a song to be a B-side, so they asked the men if they would make a whole album.\nThey did some of the recording in Bob Dylan's own studio in his outbuilding for his car. They did some of the work in Dave Stewart's kitchen. Stewart was in the band the Eurythmics.\nName.\nThe name \"Traveling Wilburys\" comes from \"We'll bury.\" When he was recording his album \"Cloud Nine\", Harrison noticed some errors in the recording and said \"Well bury them in the mix.\" At first the band was the Trembling Wilburys but they changed it to the Traveling Wilburys.\nThe musicians used pretend names for the album: George Harrison was \"Nelson Wilbury,\" Bob Dylan was \"Lucky Wilbury,\" Roy Orbison was \"Lefty Wilbury,\" Tom Petty was \"Charlie T. Jr.,\" and Jeff Lynne was \"Otis Wilbury.\" This was meant as a joke and not to trick anyone. The Wilburys were five fictional brothers who all had the same father, Charlie T. Wilbury Sr., but different mothers.\nInside the paper around the album, there was also a pretend history of the Wilburys: \"The original Wilburys were a stationary people who, realizing that their civilization could not stand still for ever, began to go for short walks \u2013 not the \u2018traveling\u2019 as we now know it, but certainly as far as the corner and back.\"\nSongs.\nThe Traveling Wilburys' first album, \"Traveling Wilburys: Volume 1\" was released in 1988. It reached #3 on Billboard's list of very good albums and sold enough copies for triple platinum.\nThe song \"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\" was written to make fun of the kinds of songs written by Bruce Springsteen up to that point.\nThe Traveling Wilburys' second album, \"Traveling Wilburys: Volume 3\" was released in 1990. Its title is not a mistake. Harrison skipped the number 2 on purpose."}

If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, citizen card) or passport card. Some countries issue formal identity documents as national identification cards.\nMany countries require all foreigners to have a passport or national identity card from their home country available at all times if they do not have a residence permit in the country.\nThe shape and size of identity cards were standardized in 1985 by ISO/IEC 7810. Some modern identity documents are smart cards including a difficult-to-forge embedded integrated circuit that were standardized in 1988 by ISO/IEC 7816. New technologies allow identity cards to contain biometric information, such as a photograph; face, hand, or iris measurements; or fingerprints. Many countries now issue electronic identity cards.\nIdentity cards allow officials to look up security data on a person in the host country's information system. Photos of the person's head are scanned into the system to prevent identity theft. A scanned photograph of the face gives a unique series of numbers which identifies that particular individual.\nThe earliest identity document was written into law by King Henry V of England with the Safe Conducts Act 1414. For the next 500 years and before World War I, most people did not have or need an identity document."}

Its color can range from black, bluish, gray, to olive brown.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nIt is found throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also found north into Canada and south into Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.\nIt is usually found near water, but it can also be found in bushes, trash piles, roadsides, and swamps. It spends most of its time on the ground. But, it is a good climber. It may be found in shrubs and trees where there are bird nests.\nMost of the eastern racers like open, grassland habitats where their eyesight and speed can be used. They are usually not far from a place to hide.\nFeeding.\nThey mainly eat small rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and other snakes. Some subspecies are known to climb trees to eat eggs and young birds. Young eastern racers usually insects with soft bodies, such as crickets and moths. They overcome moving prey by wrapping into one or two coils pressing its prey to hold it so that it can swallow it alive.\nBehaviour.\nThe eastern racers are fast, very active, diurnal snakes. Eastern racers are curious snakes. They have very good vision. They are sometimes seen raising their heads above the grass where they are crawling to see what is around them. They usually run away from a predator. They are hard to hold and will poop, and release a bad smelling liquid from their cloacae.\nReproduction.\nIt mates in the spring from April until early June. The female lays three to 30 eggs in a hidden nest, such as a hollow log, an abandoned rodent burrow, or under a rock. The young ones hatch in the early fall. They reach maturity when they are around 2 years old."}

Towards the end of his extraordinary life, he became a British citizen and was eligible to vote in the parliamentary election of 1774, and then again in 1780.\nThe details of his early life are not certain. He was born on a slave ship crossing the Atlantic. The ship went to the Spanish colonies in Central America. His parents did not survive long, and he became orphaned. His owner took him to London, and he eventually came to live with John Montague, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Mary, Duchess of Montagu. Sancho worked as her butler until her death in 1751.\nWhile living at Montague House in Blackheath, he educated himself. He enjoyed music, poetry, reading, and writing.\nDuring the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Anne Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children. Around the time their third child was born, Sancho became a valet to George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (of the second creation), the son-in-law of his earlier patron. He remained there until 1773.\nIn 1768 Thomas Gainsborough painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the Duchess of Montagu sat for her portrait by the artist. \nIn 1774, with Montague's help, he became a shopkeeper in Mayfair. He sold tobacco, sugar and tea, all of which were connected with the slave trade. As a male householder living in Mayfair, he was eligible to vote. He also wrote letters in newspapers, under his own name and under the pseudonym \"Africanus\". He supported the monarchy and British forces in the American Revolutionary War.\nSancho had many well-known visitors at his shop, including statesman and abolitionist Charles James Fox PC (1749\u20131806). Fox steered a resolution through Parliament pledging it to abolish the slave trade. A Foreign Slave Trade Bill in Spring 1806 prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain's wartime enemies. This cut out two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports."}

Vehicles pulled by animals, for example mule carts, did make roadkill, but there was much more roadkill after the invention of the automobile.\nIn the United States alone, one to two million large animals are killed as roadkill every year and many more small animals.\nCauses and costs.\nMost roadkill is caused by cars or trucks.\nIf the car hits a large animal, for example a deer or elk, it is likely to be damaged. In the United States alone, crashes with deer cause $3.6 billion in damage to cars and other vehicles, 200 deaths each year and many injuries.\nUses.\nSome roadkilled animals are sent to landfills with other garbage, but other bodies are used for scientific experiments, turned into makeup or turned into food for other animals. Some people cook and eat roadkill. Other people make the fur into clothes or other useful things. Some scientists have studied roadkill to see where invasive species have come.\nIn Alaska, all roadkill belongs to the state. Officers collect the roadkill, bring it to butchers, and bring the meat to charities. In other parts of the United States and in other countries, individual people can get permission to collect roadkill in different ways.\nPreventing roadkill.\nMany governments put up road signs such as \"deer crossing\" or \"panther crossing\" signs to tell drivers that there may be animals nearby. Some build fences around roads where cars drive at high speeds. However, then the animals try to cross at the ends of the fences, and they are hit by cars in those places.\nPlanning new roads so that wild animals can go over or under them from the start is another very good way to prevent roadkill.\nSome governments have built wildlife bridges over or underpasses under roads that were already there. In 2009, the local Department of Transportation built fences leading to four culverts on U.S. highway 27, and there were suddenly no roadkilled turtles.\nReferences.\n "}

Siverson, and James D. Morrow, published by MIT Press. It discusses the selectorate theory of politics. Their theory was refined into a 2011 publication titled \"The Dictator's Handbook.\" The main thesis of the book is the implications of selectorate theory and how to improve world and national politics based on its principles.\nMain Ideas.\nNo Ruler rules alone.\nThe theory is based on a single idea: No political leader has ever had total control of their government. Leaders need the support of at least some people to lead, because those people either do something for the leader or tell other people what to do. This means that there is a group of people the leader needs to persuade in order to obtain or keep power. These people are the selectorate, and are divided into three categories:\nThe Three Dimensions of Politics.\nThere are three groups of people that a leader, or their contenders, must remain aware of in order to keep, or acquire, power:\nThere are many ways that a leader and the selectorate interact with each other, mostly through the five rules that leaders follow to acquire and keep power.\nThe Two Strategies.\nThere are two methods of governance that form using the Selectorate Theory: a government with few Essentials- called a small coalition- and a government with a large group of Essentials- called a large coalition.\nSmall coalition governments are autocracies such as North Korea or the Soviet Union. Although many people can vote in their elections, if there are any, a leader stays in power because of the very few people who are rewarded for their loyalty. In small coalition governments, a leader can simply bribe their Essentials with material rewards such as money or real estate.\nLarge coalition governments are governments that force leaders to appeal to large amounts of people to take power, such as through an election. This style of governance makes it implausible to bribe individual voters or Essentials, meaning a leader instead pools the money earned from taxes to create policy that disproportionately rewards their Essentials more than other groups.\nHow the selectorate affects leadership.\nWith the basic idea of how a leader and their selectorate interact with each other, there are several ways that this manifests in domestic and foreign policy.\nThe Fall of Monarchy.\nMonarchy is a system where a regent has a small court of lords whom support the ruler. However, those who are eligible to become a member of the court is also small. This means a contender can easily promise big rewards for those who are able to become members of the court who aren't already, while those in the court must always prepare to be replaced, meaning they are never as loyal as they could be.\nAs such, democracy and autocracy are more stable systems for a leader because these systems allow them to follow the Second Rule: keep the Nominal selectorate as large as possible.\nForeign Aid.\nForeign aid with no strings attached, such as the giving of money from a wealthy nation to a less fortunate one, often acts as a symbiotic relationship between dictators and democrats. Large-coalition governments send foreign aid money to impoverished nations as a policy concession- thus retaining power- while the impoverished nations, who are often governed by small coalitions, distribute the money among the coalition instead of benefiting the people."}
