She is the ancestor of the current reigning princely family of Monaco. A very popular monarch she officially ruled the state with her husband but died prematurely after a reign of only 11 months. At her death her husband abdicated in favour for their son Honor\u00e9 . \nBiography.\nBorn at the Prince's Palace in Monaco, she was the second daughter of Antonio I of Monaco and Marie of Lorraine. The second of six children born to her parents, she was the first of their children to survive childhood. \nBecause she had no brothers, Louise Hippolyte became the heiress to the throne of Monaco. Her father ensured with the permission of Louis XIV, that her future husband should assume the surname of \"Grimaldi\" and rule Monaco jointly with her. \nMarried life.\nOn 20 October 1715, at the age of eighteen, she married \"\"Jacques\" Fran\u00e7ois Goyon, Count of Matignon\" after his family had proposed him as a candidate. His candidacy was supported by King Louis XIV, who wanted to increase French influence in Monaco. Prior to this, Louise Hippolyte's father was eager to wed his daughter to a Grimaldi cousin. This marriage did not materialise due to the poor finances of the Grimaldis at the time. The couple had several sons most of which were also given the title of Count of Matignon. Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Goyon was given a higher ranking title by Louis XIV namely the Duke of Valentinois (1642). Overall the couple had a fairly unhappy married life. Her husband preferred Paris and would often leave his wife and children in Monaco when he travelled to the Court of Versailles. \nLouise Hippolyte and Jacques had nine children. Her husband preferred to stay in Versailles (where he had several mistresses), instead of Monaco. \nAfter the death of her father, Louise Hippolyte traveled from Paris to Monaco on 4 April 1731 and received an enthusiastic reception from the populace. When Jacques joined her a little while later, the reception was much colder.\nAt the end of 1731, Louise Hippolyte died of smallpox. Her husband neglected the affairs of Monaco and had to leave the country in May 1732. He abdicated in favour of their son, Honor\u00e9, the next year.\nHer husband remained a widower, despite a large dowry offered to him by the Duchess of Maine to get him to marry her unattractive daughter, \"Mademoiselle du Maine\", a granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. The princess died of smallpox aged 34 and was buried in the Saint Nicholas Cathedral itself the family crypt of the House of Grimaldi.\nIssue.\nThe children of the couple were technically given the surname of \"Goyon de Matignon\" after their father however they were sometimes also known under the surname of Grimaldi too.

He was educated at local schools in Donndorf and Pforta. In 1814 he went to the University of Leipzig. He studied Classics and Lutheran theology. From 1817-1825 he was a Classics teacher. While teaching he became interested in history. In 1824 he released his first book: \"Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen V\u00f6lker von 1494 bis 1514\" (\"History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514\"). Ranke was a firm believer in historicism. For that reason he insisted on using primary sources.\nUniversity professor.\nRanke was a professor at the University of Berlin. He was a professor there for almost 50 years. While there he criticized the historical theories of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He also advised his students to go to archives in search of sources. Because of this many think of him as the founder of a historical social science. Ranke retired as a professor in 1871, but still wrote history. In 1880 he started writing a book on world history, beginning in Ancient Egypt with the story of the Israelites. When he died in 1886 he had not finished his book, and had only written up to the 12th century. \nHonors.\nIn 1831 the Prussian Government asked Ranke to start and edit the \"Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift\" journal. Ranke, who was conservative, sometimes used the journal to attack liberalism. In 1841 Ranke was made Royal Historiographer of the Prussian Court. In 1865 Ranke was made a noble, and in 1882 he was made a member of the Prussian Privy Council. In 1885 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society."}

By 1600 about 100,000 slaves had been brought to the colony. The rate increased after 1650 because of labor needed for the gold mines. Conditions were harsher for some slaves than others.

They are at the top of their food chain.\nApex predators have big effects on the animals and plants lower down the food chain. If they become extinct in an area, many changes happen. In recent times, it is often humans who have removed top predators.\nAn example of apex predators affecting an ecosystem is in Yellowstone National Park. After the gray wolf was reintroduced, in 1995, researchers noticed big changes occurring in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Elk, the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior. This freed the riparian (river) zones from constant grazing. This allowed willows, aspens, and cottonwoods to grow, so creating a habitat for beaver, moose, and scores of other species. In addition to the effects on prey species, the gray wolf's presence also affected the park's grizzly bear, a vulnerable species. The bears, emerging from hibernation, chose to scavenge off wolf kills after fasting for months. They can also eat wolf kills in autumn to prepare for hibernation. As grizzly bears give birth during hibernation, a greater food supply may improve the mother\u2019s nutrition and increase the number of cubs. Dozens of other species, including eagles, ravens, magpies, coyotes, and black bears, have been seen scavenging from wolf kills."}

It happens at a given pressure. The enthalpies of vaporization are usually measured at the normal boiling point for that substance. The units are usually J/mol.\nAn example is when the cooling effects of vaporization controls the body temperature of humans. Warm weather or exercise creates heat in the body. This causes the body to sweat (or perspire). The body feels cooler when the liquid sweat evaporates. As the humidity increases, the rate of evaporation decreases. This determines the body's comfort level."}

Warriors won prestige by acts of courage in the face of the enemy. Any blow struck against the enemy counted as a coup. \nAn act of bravery.\nCounting coup could be with a hand, any part of the body, or with an object. The most prestigious act was to touch or strike an enemy warrior, leave him alive, then escaping unharmed. Touching the first enemy to die in battle or touching the enemy's defensive works also counted as coup. Counting coup could also involve stealing an enemy's weapons or horses tied up to his lodge in camp. Risk of injury or death was required to count coup. After a battle or exploit, the people of a tribe would gather together to recount their acts of bravery and \"count coup.\" Coups were recorded in some tribes by putting notches (cut marks) in a coup stick. A coup stick was often a willow rod with a feather on the end. But coup could be counted with any object.\nOther uses.\nAnother form of counting coup emerged during the air battles of World War I. A allied pilot who shot down five enemy aircraft was given the status of ace. The exception was that the British never formally adopted the ace system. Informally, however, a British pilot who had shot down ten enemy planes was considered an ace. Generally \"counting coup\" is counting victories. "}

The river was cut off from the Rhine later. The area where the Rhine was connected to the Rotte changed into an area of bog. After all the bog was excavated, the area changed into a swamp, this swamp was the new source of the Rotte. In the 17th century the swamp area is empoldered, and the Rotte did not have a source anymore.\nIn the early medieval age, settlement was founded. But because of floods in the area, the people were not able to live in the area. Later in 1270, a 400 meter long dam was build along the river, people started to live on this dam, and that is where Rotterdam was founded. Today, this dam is the \"Hoogstraat\" in Rotterdam."}

The expedition began in 1914, but the ship, \"Endurance\", became hopelessly trapped in packed ice sheets and was destroyed. The cat, along with some of the sled dogs, were shot to death in 1915, when it was decided they could not survive.\nLife on the ship.\nMrs. Chippy, a tiger-striped tabby, belonged to Harry McNish, the carpenter. Harry was given the nickname \"Chippy\" because of \"wood chips\", so the cat was also called the same. Soon after the ship set sail for Antarctica, it was discovered that, despite \"her\" name, Mrs. Chippy was a \"he\", a male cat. By that time the name had stuck. The cat amazed the crew by being able to walk along the ship's inch-wide guard rails, in even the roughest seas.\nAfter the ship was destroyed in the ice, the crew leaders knew that Mrs. Chippy and five of the dogs would not be able to live, and on October 29, 1915, Sir Shackleton wrote in his diary:\nHarry McNish had become very fond of his cat, and never forgave Shackleton for having him shot. After the loss of his cat, Harry fought with Shackleton during the expedition that lasted until 1917. Even though he did build the boats that eventually rescued the crew, he was not given a Polar Medal, because of his arguing with the captain over the death of his cat.\nMemorial and painting.\nIn 2004, a bronze memorial statue of Mrs. Chippy was placed on the grave of Harry McNish. It was given by the Antarctic Society of New Zealand, because of his bravery on the expedition.\nThe painting \"Mrs Chippy\", by Wolf Howard, shows the cat \"about to be shot\". The background shows the crew sending a small boat on a rescue mission and \"Endurance\" is stuck in the ice. The painting was shown in a punk art exhibit at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, England, in 2004."}

Many countries recognise it. It is also in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This means it is part of international law. \nDefinition.\nThe base for the right to housing in international law can be found in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration recognises the right as part of the right to an adequate standard of living.\nIt states that:\nArticle 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) also guarantees the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living among economic, social and cultural rights.\nIn international human rights law the right to housing is regarded as a freestanding right. This was clarified in the 1991 General Comment no 4 on Adequate Housing by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The general comment provides an authoritative interpretation of the right to housing in legal terms under international law.\nThe right to housing is also mentioned in Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 16 of the European Social Charter (Article 31 of the Revised European Social charter) and in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. According to UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, aspects of right to housing under ICESCR include: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location and cultural adequacy. As a political goal, right to housing was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the Second Bill of Rights."}

It is used to make sure only certain people can get, use, or change information in the system.\nPINs were created to be used with automated teller machines. Once someone inserts a bank card into the machine, they would be asked to enter a PIN using the buttons on a keypad, and would only be allowed to get their money if they entered the corrected PIN. In a similar way, EMV technology makes use of PIN numbers to make sure only the person holding a credit card can make a transaction with it.\nEarly PIN numbers only consisted of digits. Today, some banks use PINs made of digits and letters. There are also many new technologies being created to be used instead of PINs, such as using fingerprint scanners."}

He was one of the main thinkers behind Classical economics, together with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill. Today, he is mostly known for his theory of comparative advantage. This theory suggests that a nation should concentrate its resources only in industries where it is \"most\" internationally competitive and trade with other countries to obtain products not produced nationally. Ricardo promoted the idea of extreme industry specialization by nations, to the point of dismantling internationally competitive and otherwise profitable industries. In this thinking Ricardo assumed the existence of a national industry policy aimed at promoting some industries to the detriment of others. For Ricardo some form of Central Economic Planning was a given.\nThe Ricardian model of comparative advantage has been challenged by, among others, Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa. Nevertheless, it remains the cornerstone of the argument in favour of international free trade as a means of increasing economic prosperity. The theory of comparative advantage was the forerunner of the push towards globalization via increased international trade, the guiding theme in economic policy currently promoted by the OECD and the World Trade Organization."}

In geometry, a torus is obtained by rotating a circle in three dimensional space. To make a torus, the circle is rotated around a line (called the axis of rotation) that is in the same plane as the circle. Usually the line does not touch the circle, so the torus has a hole through the center, and the torus is called a ring torus. For a ring torus, the axis of rotation passes through the center of the hole. \nIn topology, sizes don't matter, and a torus is any shape that has one hole through it. \nThe ring torus is the most well-known type of torus, but other types exist. If the line the circle rotates around is tangent to the circle, then it becomes a horn torus, and if it passes through the circle then it is a spindle torus. A toroid is a suface made by rotating any shape around a line, so a torus is one kind of toroid. \nIf the torus is filled to make a solid shape, it is called a solid torus. A solid torus is often simply called a torus. A solid torus is made by rotating a disk (a filled-in circle) around a line. Common objects that have the shape of a solid torus are a doughnut, a bagel and an O-ring.\nA torus is like a tube that is bent into a circle so it connects to itself. The radius of the tube or circle is called the \"minor radius\", written formula_1. The distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus is called the \"major radius\", written formula_2. \nThe surface area of a torus is given by \nThis area is the same as the area of a straight tube that has radius formula_1 and length formula_5.\nThe volume of a solid torus is given by \nThis volume is the same as the volume of a straight rod that has radius formula_1 and length formula_5."}

Many LGBT student groups and books include questioning in their books and literature; in the case of gay-straight alliances they do so in part so that students are not forced to label themselves or choose a sexual or gender identity.\nAccording to the American Psychological Association:\n\"Adolescence can be a period of experimentation, and many youths may question their sexual feelings. Becoming aware of sexual feelings is a normal developmental task of adolescence. Sometimes adolescents have same-sex feelings or experiences that cause confusion about their sexual orientation. This confusion appears to decline over time, with different outcomes for different individuals.\"\nSome young people avoid \"coming out of the closet\" (telling others their sexual orientation) because of homophobic negative beliefs by other people. For some young people, admitting their sexual or gender identity can bring an end to this confusion. Those who receive support can often live happy and healthy lives. However, those who do not are more likely to have to deal with bullying, experiencing suicidal thoughts, and are more likely to engage in risky activities such as having unprotected sex (not using a condom), misuse drugs and become alcoholic. Questioning young people are at higher risk of these than their open LGBT peers.\nAn issue of anxiety or depression related to a doubt about one's gender identity or sexual orientation has been classified as sexual maturation disorder by the WHO in the ICD-10, under \"Mental and behavioural sicknesses/problems connected with sexual development and orientation\". Sexual orientation, by itself, is not an illness and is not classified under this heading. "}

The first time was due to a chimney fire that spread to the other houses. The second time was during the English Civil War. The third time was in 1724 when another fire destroyed most of the village. It was rebuilt the last time in the Georgian style. New inns and a Market-house were added.\nWoburn Abbey.\nRight in the centre of Woburn is a short road leading to Woburn Park, the large estate of the Duke of Bedford.

They were banned if the Church thought they were heretical, anti-clerical (anti-church) or lascivious (obscene). It was censorship by the Catholic Church.\nEarly versions of the Index were published in Catholic Netherlands (1529); Venice (1543) and Paris (1551). By mid-century, with wars of religion in France and Germany, authorities thought control of the press could prevent the spread of heresy. This could be done by using a catalog of prohibited works, backed by ecclesiastic and civil authorities.\nThe first version published in Rome (the \"Pauline Index\") was issued by Pope Paul IV in 1559. From 1571 to 1917 the Sacred Congregation of the Index was in charge of updating the list. The 20th and final edition appeared in 1948, and the \"Index\" was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by Pope Paul VI.\nThe aim of the list was to protect the belief and morals of the faithful. This was done by preventing them from reading heretical and immoral books. Books thought to contain such errors included works by astronomers such as Johannes Kepler's \"Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae\", which was on the Index from 1621 to 1835, and by philosophers, like Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\". The various editions of the \"Index\" also had the rules of the Church about the reading, selling and censorship of books. Even editions and translations of the Bible not been approved by the Church could be banned.\nEnforcing the Index was the Inquisition. The burning at the stake of Giordano Bruno, whose entire works were placed on the Index on 8 February 1600, was (on the surface) for heresy, not for heliocentrism or other scientific views. However, those other views included a belief in 'other worlds', which was heresy.\nNot until 1822 did the Church permit books to be printed which accepted the Earth's motion.\nThe developments since the abolition of the \"Index\" show \"the loss of relevance of the Index in the 21st century\". A complete list of the authors and writings present in the successive editions of the \"Index\" is given in J. Mart\u00ednez de Bujanda, \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum, 1600\u20131966\". A list of the books that were on the \"Index\" can be found on the World Wide Web."}

This technique can be used to produce breathable oxygen or hydrogen gas as a fuel source, referred to as hydrogen fuel. However, that method is more expensive than the industrial way to produce hydrogen fuel from natural gas.\nThis is what is referred to as a non-spontaneous reaction which requires impetus.\nAt the cathode, reduction (in this case, the gain of electrons) occurs. At the anode, oxidation (in this case, the loss of electrons) occurs. Normally, the reaction is balanced with either an acid or a base as shown in the equations below.\nThat two reactions are half reactions. They are balanced with an acid. Commonly hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is used. However, the half reactions can also be balanced with a base, for example with sodium hydroxide.\nCombining one pair of half reactions leads to an overall reaction, which is then the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen."}

It was directed by Christian Alvart and was produced by Lisa Bruce, Steve Golin, Alix Madigan, and Kevin Misher. \"Case 39\" was released on August 13, 2009 in the United Kingdom, as well as European and Latin American countries. The movie was originally supposed to be released in North America in August 2008 but it was delayed twice.\nPlot.\nEmily Jenkins (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) is a social worker with her son Tom Jenkins (Matthew Lillard) living in Oregon, who is assigned to investigate the family of ten-year-old Lillith Sullivan (Jodelle Ferland), as her grades have declined and an emotional rift with her parents has emerged. Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lillith's parents, Edward and Margaret Sullivan (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley) are placed in a mental institution.\nNot too long after Lillith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents with a crowbar, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lillith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night after receiving a strange phone call, Douglas is panicked by a mass of hornets coming out of his body in hysteria and kills himself in the bathroom.\nEmily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lillith's parents. They tell her that, far from being truly human, Lillith is actually a Succubus-like demon who feeds on emotion, and that they had tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lillith's father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lillith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum, Lillith's mother hallucinates being on fire, and her father is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke. Barron initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help, but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith. He arms himself to help Emily. However, he fatally shoots himself in the head with his shotgun, as Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs.\nAfter realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated, and that the rest of her cases will be next, Emily and Tom serve Lillith tea spiked with sedative. While Lillith is asleep, Emily sets fire to her house, hoping to get rid of her. However, the girl apparently escapes unharmed (from this point on, the audience may wonder whether Lilith is really present or Emily is hallucinating her presence). A police officer offers to escort Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep. As Emily is following the police cars, she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed, hoping to bring fear to Lillith. Instead, Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother driving fast in a rainstorm. Emily fights through the memory, telling herself that it is not real. The image fades, and Lillith appears scared by the fact that Emily and Tom were able to fight through their illusions.\nEmily drives the car off a pier. As the car sinks, Emily and Tom struggle to lock Lillith (now in her demonic true form) in the trunk. Emily then attempts to swim to the surface. The demon grabs Emily's foot and Tom's hand to stop hthem from swimming away but Emily and Tom struggle and eventually break free, as a trapped Lillith sinks to the bottom. Emily and Tom climb out of the water and sit on the pier."}

They include large corporations which produce or sell goods or services in various countries. They may be referred as 'international' or 'transnational' or 'stateless' corporations.\nMNCs play an important role in globalization. Arguably, the first multinational business organization was the \"Knights Templar\" , founded in 1120. After that came the British East India Company in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company which started in1602 and would become the largest company in the world for nearly 200 years. These were made by national legislation to conduct international trade for their home countries.\nThe behavior of MNCs is much discussed.\nConflict of laws.\nConflict of laws is about which legal system and which national jurisdiction applies to a given dispute.\nThe term comes from situations where here is disagreement as to where a dispute should be legally settled in court. The three branches of conflict of laws are:\nConflict of taxation.\nCompanies usually arrange their affairs to avoid or diminish taxation. This issue attracts much attention. Obviously, tax rates and tax regulations differ from country to country. If an organisation sets up subsidiaries in every country where it has significant business, few problems arise. The subsidiaries pay tax on whatever activities the company does in that place.\nHowever, companies always try to minimise tax. Google uses various tax avoidance strategies. Out of the five largest American technology companies it pays the lowest taxes to countries where its revenue comes from. The company does this partly by licensing technology through subsidiaries in Ireland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands. This reportedly sparked a 2012 French investigation into Google's \"transfer pricing\" methods.\nGoogle Vice President Matt Britt in 2013 told the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales, hence owed no sales tax to the UK.\nTransnational corporations.\nA transnational corporation (TNC) differs from a traditional MNC in that it does not identify itself with one national home. While traditional MNCs are national companies with foreign subsidiaries, TNCs spread out their operations in many countries sustaining high levels of local responsiveness.&lt;ref name=\"Case study: The Relationship between the Structure/Strategy of Multinational Corporations and Patterns of Knowledge Sharing within them\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a TNC is Nestl\u00e9 who employ senior executives from many countries and try to make decisions from a global perspective rather than from one centralized headquarters. Another example of a Transnational Corporation is the Royal Dutch Shell corporation whose headquarters may be in The Hague, Netherlands but its registered office and main executive body where the decisions are made is headquartered in London, United Kingdom."}

He is well known for his translation of the Bible into English, and for his later prosecution and execution.\nHe was influenced by the work of Erasmus, who made the Greek New Testament available in Europe, and by Martin Luther. The spread of the Wycliffe Bible led to strong measures to keep translations in the hands of the Catholic Church. There was a death sentence for any unlicensed possession of scripture in English\u2014even though translations in all other major European languages were accepted.\nTyndale's translation was the first English Bible to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, and the first English one to take advantage of the printing press. It was seen as a direct challenge to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1530, Tyndale also wrote \"The Practyse of Prelates\", opposing Henry VIII's divorce on the grounds that it contravened Scripture.\nA copy of Tyndale's earlier \"The Obedience of a Christian Man\" fell into the hands of Henry VIII. There, the king found the reasons he used to break the Church in England from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534. Meanwhile, the agents of Chancellor Thomas More were searching in Europe for Tyndale, who had taken refuge where he hoped the Church could not get at him.\nEventually, in 1535, Tyndale was arrested and jailed outside Brussels for over a year. More himself was executed on 6 July 1535. In 1536 Tyndale was convicted of heresy and executed by garrotting, and his body was burnt at the stake. Two years later Henry VIII authorized the so-called Great Bible for the Church of England. It was largely Tyndale's own work. Hence, the Tyndale Bible, as it was known, played a key role in spreading Reformation ideas.\nIn 1611, the 54 scholars who produced the King James Version drew significantly from Tyndale, as well as translations that descended from his. One estimate suggests the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale's and the Old Testament 76%. In 2002, Tyndale was placed at number 26 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\nLast words.\nThe last words of William Tyndale, before being strangled and burnt at the stake: \"Lord, open the King of England's eyes\"."}

She was the youngest sibling of King Louis XVI. During the French Revolution, she stayed with the king and his family. She was executed at Place de la R\u00e9volution in Paris during the \"Reign of Terror\" in the French Revolution. She is regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr and is venerated as a Servant of God. \nLife.\n\u00c9lisabeth was the youngest child of the dauphin and dauphine of France. She was born during the reign of her grandfather, Louis XV. She grew up in the Palace of Versailles. She was always close to her older sister Clotilde. The two sisters were raised together by Madame de Marsan. \n\u00c9lisabeth was a skillful rider. She was also interested in art. Several of her drawings are in the museum of the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. In 1774, her grandfather, Louis XV, died. Her elder brother became king as Louis XVI.\n\u00c9lisabeth was deeply religious. She was devoted to her brother the king. She refused to marry so that she could stay in France. In 1777, a marriage was suggested to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. He was the son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and brother of her sister-in-law, Queen Marie Antoinette. \u00c9lisabeth declined with her brother's consent.\n\u00c9lisabeth was executed during the French Revolution. She was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re des Errancis, Paris. Her body was later moved to the Catacombs of Paris. \nCause of beatification and canonization.\nMadame Elisabeth died in the odor of holiness. According to Madame de Genlis, a scent of roses spread across the Place de la Concorde after her execution. In 1953, Pope Pius XII recognized by decree the heroic character of her virtues simply because of her martyrdom. The princess was declared a Servant of God and the cause of beatification was officially presented on December 23, 1953 by Cardinal Maurice Feltin, Archbishop of Paris. In 2016, Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, Archbishop of Paris, reactivated the cause of his beatification. Father Xavier Sno\u00ebk, pastor of the parish of Sainte-\u00c9lisabeth-de-Hungary, was appointed postulator of the cause (church located in the old Temple district where the princess was imprisoned), and in May 2017 he recognized the association of the faithful promoters of their cause. On November 15, 2017, Cardinal Vingt-Trois, after consulting with the French Bishops' Conference and the nihil obstat of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome, hopes that the process will lead to the canonization of Madame Elisabeth , sister of Louis XVI.

It is the largest macaw and the largest flying parrot species.\nHabitat loss and trapping wild birds for the pet trade has taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, and as a result the species is classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\nThey eat nuts from native palms. They have large, powerful beaks that can crack nuts and seeds, while their dry, smooth tongues have a bone inside them that makes them effective for tapping into fruits. The acuri nut is so hard that the parrots cannot feed on it until it has passed through the digestive system of cattle. In addition, they eat fruits and other vegetable matter. Their diet includes fruits, nuts, nectar, and various kinds of seeds. They travel for ripe food over a vast area.\nThis beautiful bird is endangered. In the wild its eggs are eaten by various small mammals, by vultures, and by the toucan. The hyacinth depends on the toucan, which spreads the seeds of the Manduvi tree (\"Sterculia apetala\") that the macaw needs for reproduction. The tree is just right for the macaw to make its nest, and there are few other places as good. The toucan disperses 83% of the tree's seeds, but also eats 53% of the macaw's eggs.\nBut by far, humans are the main cause of its problems. The illegal trade in fancy feathers, the pet trade and the destruction of habitat has greatly reduced its numbers."}

These two halves of the brain are not exactly alike. For most tasks, both sides of the brain work together. But each side of the brain specializes in some things and works harder on those things than the other side. The term brain lateralization, or lateralization of brain function, means that the different halves do things differently.\nThe brain's hemispheres.\nA deep groove called the longitudinal fissure separates the brain into its two hemispheres (halves). The two hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibers. The corpus callous allows the right and left hemispheres to communicate with each other, and to work together.\nBoth the left and right hemispheres look and work in similar ways. The large parts of both hemispheres are exactly the same on both sides. But in the smaller parts, there are some differences. \nSometimes, the brain is different for left-handed and right-handed people. For example, there are two areas in the brain that are very important for speech: Broca's area and Wernicke's area. These two areas are in the left hemisphere for about 95% of right-handed people, but only about 70% of left-handed people.\nCommon mistakes.\nPopular articles on psychology often say that each side of the brain does things that the other does not. For example, a common mistake is the idea that the left side of the brain does all of a person's \"logical thinking\" (like solving math problems), while the right brain does all the \"creative thinking\" (like painting or drawing). It is often said that a person who is creative is \"right-brained,\" while a person who is more logical or \"book-smart\" is \"left-brained.\" \nThe truth is that both hemispheres work together on both logical and creative thinking. However, even though the two hemispheres work together, there is some hemispheric specialisation. Usually, the right side of the brain dominates the functions to do with creativity, spatial awareness, appreciation of music etc. whereas the left side of the brain dominates analytical, language-based and logical functions.\nExamples of lateralization.\nBoth hemispheres work together to do most things. However, for certain tasks, one hemisphere may be more \"dominant\" than the other. For example, in about 95% of right-handed people, the left hemisphere is dominant when it comes to language. For these people, their language abilities are controlled mostly by the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere helps too, but not as much as the left hemisphere.\nLanguage.\nSpecifically, important parts of language like grammar and vocabulary are usually \"lateralized\" to the left hemisphere. This means that most thinking about grammar and vocabulary happens in the left half of the brain. This is especially true in right-handed people.\nNot all parts of language are controlled mostly by the left hemisphere. Other important parts of language, like intonation (how words are said) and accentuation (which words in a sentence are stressed), are often lateralized to the right hemisphere.\nLanguage production writing or speaking \u2013 is an example of how lateralization can be different for right-handed and left-handed people. Language production is lateralized to the left hemisphere in about 90% of right-handed people. But in about half of left-handed people, language production is controlled by both hemispheres, or mostly by the right hemisphere. \nBrain injury.\nSometimes, people have brain injuries that hurt or destroy part of the brain. With very bad injuries, an entire hemisphere may be destroyed. Sometimes that hemisphere's jobs can be done by part of the other hemisphere. However, this is not always possible. It depends on the area that was damaged and the patient's age. \nSometimes, a brain injury damages pathways that carry information from one area to another. In some people, the brain can create other, less direct pathways (like detours). These new 'detours' may help the brain continue to carry information between the areas that were separated by the brain injury."}

It's is a three-aisled hall church. It holds 1,250 people. In the southwestern part of the church building is a tower. The church was inaugurated in September 1903. It was build following a design competition nine years earlier. Gustaf Hermansson won the competition. He also designed the Sofia Church. The church is located in the southeastern part of \u00d6stermalm. It is placed where Storgatan and Narvav\u00e4gen meet near the Swedish History Museum. Together with nearby Strandv\u00e4gen Narvav\u00e4gen is one of the Stockholm's main boulevards. The road is lined with several residential palaces. The church is also visible from Narvav\u00e4gen.\nThe church was named after king Oscar II of Sweden. Oscar II himself laid the foundation stone 1897. Construction work was delayed several times because of problems with the foundation and non-deliveries as well as labour strikes. This led to the church not being consecrated until 1903. The church was originally meant to be partly clad in brick. This was changed to a uniformly white fa\u00e7ade, clad in limestone and marble. Construction was criticised from the start for its Gothic Revival. \nThe church underwent several renovations during the 20th century. Between 1921\u20131923 major changes were done to the interior. During those years new stained glass windows designed by Emanuel Vigeland were added. The work was led under the direction of architect Lars Israel Wahlman. He had previously designed the Engelbrekt Church. Between 1954\u20131956 additional changes were made to the church interior. During those years the altarpiece was changed and some ornamental ceiling decorations were removed."}

To keep costs down Disney produced his own music. Disney's first music director and composer was Carl Stalling. The Mickey Mouse shorts used pop music while the Silly Symphony cartoons used Classical music. In 1932 the studio produced its first cartoon in Technicolor, \"Flowers and Trees\". The success of the song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?, from the Silly Symphony short \"Three Little Pigs\" (1933), convinced Disney to keep producing original music. It was at this time Disney introduced the characters of Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Minnie Mouse. Over its ten year run, \"Silly Symphonies\" had won Walt Disney the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film seven times. This record was matched only by \"Tom and Jerry\".

They shot and killed 12 people, including \"Charlie Hebdo\" staff and two French National police officers, and wounded 11 others. In Niger churches and cars were burned in protest of Muhammed on the cover of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\nThe gunmen entered the building and began shooting with automatic weapons, while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\". Up to 50 shots were fired during the attack. Following a massive manhunt, the French police believe they have located the attackers and are mounting an operation against them. On Twitter people used the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie to show support for freedom of speech after the shooting.\nBackground.\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" is an antireligious left-wing newspaper. In 2011 the newspaper's office was firebombed because the cover of an issue of the newspaper called \"Charia Hebdo\" had a cartoon of Prophet Muhammed on it. The newspaper's editor-in-chief St\u00e9phane \"Charb\" Charbonnier was added to Al-Qaeda's most wanted list in 2013.\nSuspects.\nSa\u00efd Kouachi and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi were identified by French police as the main suspects in the shooting. The two Franco-Algerian brothers, both from Gennevilliers, are aged 34 and 32, respectively. In 2008, Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi was convicted of terrorism charges and sentenced to three years in prison, along with 18 months of suspension, for having assisted in sending fighters to Iraq's insurgency.\nHamyd Mourad, an 18-year-old homeless man of unknown nationality, was identified by the police as a third suspect in the shooting."}

It was founded by Georges Bernier and Fran\u00e7ois Cavanna in 1970.\nThe stories and cartoons they publish are very left-wing and anarchist, with primarily political satire. Following a long tradition in France, called anti-clericalism, the magazine strongly criticized all religions; it has often published caricatures of Jews, Muslims or Christians (especially Catholics). Some Islamic fundamentalists were offended at some cartoons, and repeatedly sent death threats to the journalists of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\nOn 7 January 2015, there was a massacre at their office, in which six journalists and cartoonists were killed. This massacre was a shock to millions of people in the world. It was felt to many people like an attack on the freedom of speech, which is an essential part of a democracy."}

The team is run by Hockey Canada, a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. From 1920 until 1963 Canada did not have a single national hockey team. Instead, senior amateur club teams played for Canada . Canada's national men's team was created in 1963 by Father David Bauer as a part of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. This team played out of the University of British Columbia. During the 1972 Summit Series, the name \"Team Canada\" was first used. The Canadian national team is now often called \"Team Canada\".\nTeam Canada has been one of the leading national ice hockey teams playing around the world. They won the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, four of five Canada Cups since 1976, nine Olympic gold medals (the most of any hockey nation); Salt Lake City 2002, Vancouver 2010, and Sochi 2014. They are 25-time IIHF World Champions and winner of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.\nHistory.\nFrom 1920 to 1963 the senior amateur club teams that played for Canada were usually the most recent Allan Cup champions. The last amateur club team from Canada to win a gold medal at the World Championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961. After the 1963 World Championships, Father David Bauer founded the national team to play hockey for Canada in games around the world. This new team had it's first games at the 1964 Winter Olympics.\nBefore the Soviet Union began playing international hockey in 1954, Canada won many of the international hockey games. Team Canada won six out of seven golds at the Olympics and 10 World Championship gold medals. After Canada won the Winter Olympic Gold medal in 1952, they did not win another gold medal for 50 years. From 1962 to 1993 the team was not able to win any World Championships. It was difficult for Team Canada to win because the country's best professional players were not able to play for Team Canada. Instead, they were playing for their National Hockey League teams.\nCanada stopped playing in IIHF events in 1970 and Team Canada stopped playing in any games after the team was told they could not use semi-professional players at the World Championship. Canada once again began playing in the IIHF in 1977 after the IIHF President Dr. Sabetzki and top officials of professional ice hockey in Canada and the United States were able to come to an agreement. They agreed that professionals would be allowed to play hockey at the World Championship and the tournament would be scheduled later in the year. This allowed players from the NHL to play, after their teams were no longer playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs. They also agreed to create the \"Canada Cup\". This championship would be played every four years in North American. Canada, the United States, and the four best European national teams would play in this championship.\nIn 1983, Hockey Canada began the \"Program of Excellence\". This program was made to help prepare a team for the Winter Olympics every four years. This new National Team played a full season together all over the world against both national and club teams. Often, young players hoping to play in the NHL would play on this new team. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to allow professional athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. This allowed many experienced NHL players to join the team. In 1998 the NHL decided to stop letting players compete in the Olympics, so the Program of Excellence was shut down.\nAfter not winning a gold medal for 33 years, Canada won the 1994 World Championship in Italy. Since 1994, Team Canada has won in 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2007. Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years at Salt Lake City 2002. At Vancouver 2010, Canada won the gold medal with a 3\u20132 win against the United States in the final. Sidney Crosby's overtime goal won Canada the final gold medal awarded at the Games. At the 2012 World Championship in Finland and Sweden, Ryan Murray became the first draft eligible prospect to represent Canada at the Ice Hockey World Championship.\nAfter winning the Gold medal in the 2010 Winter Olympics, Team Canada was able to win gold again at the Sochi 2014 Olympic games. This was the first time a team had won Gold medals twice in a row since the Soviet Union in 1988. Team Canada was also the first to finish the tournament without loosing any games since 1984. The team played so well that it was said they may be the best team that Canada had ever had. Drew Doughty and Shea Weber scored the most goals for the team, while Jonathan Toews scored the gold medal-winning goal in the first period of a 3\u20130 win over Sweden in the final. After the 2014 Olympics Steve Yzerman, stepped down as general manager of the team. In 2015, Team Canada was able to win their first hockey World Championship since 2007.\nPlayers.\n2014 Winter Olympics roster.\nRoster for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from February 8\u201323, 2014.\n2014 IIHF World Championship roster.\nRoster for the 2014 IIHF World Championship in Minsk, Belarus, from May 9\u201325, 2014.\n2014 Spengler Cup roster.\nRoster for the 2014 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland, from December 26\u201331, 2014.\nCompetition achievements.\nOlympic Games.\nAll Olympic ice hockey tournaments between 1920 and 1968 also counted as World Championships.

It is \"not\" a taxonomic category: they are linked only by their asexuality. The taxonomy of fungi is either based on morphological characteristics (what they look like), or that of biological species. Fungi imperfecti do not fit well into these schemes. \nDeueromycota literally means \"second fungi\", and was once a phylum within the fungi. The fungi in deuteromycota reproduce asexually, or vegetatively: \"sexual reproduction has never been observed in these species\". The term is now used only informally for species of fungi that are asexually reproducing members of the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.\nThere are about 25,000 species that have been classified in the deuteromycota and many are basidiomycota or ascomycota. Fungi producing the antibiotic penicillin and those that cause athlete's foot and yeast infections are imperfect fungi. In addition, there are a number of edible imperfect fungi, including the ones that provide the distinctive characteristics of Roquefort and Camembert cheese. Some fungi which are used to develop immunosuppressant drugs, are imperfect fungi. Other imperfect fungi are used for insect pest control. \nOther, more informal, names besides Deuteromycota (\"Deuteromycetes\") and fungi imperfecti, are anamorphic fungi, or mitosporic fungi. None of these names are terms of taxonomic rank. They are convenience terms."}

It can also be a dangerous weapon under a person's control that is not readily visible. The term is most often applied to handguns. A dangerous weapon is any weapon that can inflict death or serious injury on another person. Various jurisdictions define what a dangerous weapon is. Carrying a concealed weapon is illegal as defined by laws of many states, provinces, and countries. The usual exceptions are law enforcement officers and members of the military who carry weapons as part of their jobs. Many jurisdictions may issue concealed weapons permits (also called concealed carry permits) giving individuals permission to carry a concealed weapon within their jurisdiction.\nConcealed weapon laws.\nCarrying a concealed weapon (CCW) is the practice of carrying a handgun out of sight, hidden somewhere on a person's body. CCW is regulated by the states in the US. The laws vary, sometimes considerably, from state to state. As of 2015, most states grant licenses to carry handguns on a \"Shall-Issue\" basis to qualified applicants. Shall-Issue means the jurisdiction issuing the license must issue the license to anyone who is not otherwise prevented from owning a firearm. \"May-Issue\" allows the jurisdiction to decide on a case-by-case basis who may be issued a license. A few states are may-issue states, while seven states allow the carrying of firearms in a concealed manner without a permit (called Constitutional-carry). \nGlobal gun laws.\nGun laws vary considerably around the world. The larger majority of countries heavily restrict or do not allow citizens to carry firearms. \nUnited States and Canada.\nPenalties for carrying a concealed weapon in the US without a permit can vary by jurisdiction. In some cases it is a misdemeanor but more often it is considered a felony. In Canada CCW is illegal but permitted under rare circumstances. \nMexico.\nIn Mexico civilians cannot own guns since it has been illegal since 1968. However, most Mexicans own guns, even fully automatic weapons. In South Africa there are about 6 million licensed handgun owners. There is also a very large backlog of those applying for a license. Illegal guns can be easily bought off the streets. About 2,000 guns are stolen per month from licensed owners making it the largest source of illegal guns."}

The show is now a franchise with countries across the globe hosting their own version. The show first aired on 17 September 2010.\nFormat.\nThe way The Voice works is different in some countries, but most retain these rounds and rules. Kids versions are made as well. Almost anyone 8 and up can apply to be on the show. However, only contestants that are teenagers and up can apply to compete on the show where adults compete.\nNote: Contestant &amp; Artist mean the same thing.\nBlind Auditions.\nA certain number of contestants perform, hoping to impress the coaches. The contestant(s) pick(s) a song to perform, and the judges listen to the contestant blindly, only judging their voice because they are turned away from the contestant, to avoid bias against certain people. If a coach likes a contestant's voice enough, the coach can press their button and they will turn around and see who the contestant is. The contestant does not stop performing until their song is over. If more than one coach turns, the contestant gets to decide which coach they would like to work with. If only one coach turns, the contestant just goes on their team after talking about the performance. If no coaches turn, the contestant is eliminated. Although the coaches do give advice to all contestants that perform. Once a coach's team has a certain number of artists, they may no longer add artists to their team. \nBlock.\nThe block is a feature that prevents another coach from getting an artist. If a coach blocks, they must press their block button for that contestant, hit their button to turn around and see the contestant, and finally turn around before the coach they decide to block turns around. Only one block can be performed per performance. If a coach tries to block an artist that is already blocked, their block will not work. \nBattles.\nIn the battles, coaches decide to pair two artists from their team against each other, performing the same song in a \"boxing ring\" type arena. The paired artists train together with their coach to improve upon their skills. Each sings a different parts of a song, relay style. The artists perform at the same time in the battles. Once the song is over and the coaches make their comments, it is up to the contestant's coach to decide who is the winner of the battle. The winner advances to the knockouts. Coaches have saves and steals which they can use to save an artist on their team, or steal one from another team. However, these are limited. \nKnockouts.\nIn the knockouts, the remaining artists once again battle each other, however this time they work individually with their coach. Also, each artist performs their own song and they do not sing at the same time. Like the battles,Once the song is over and the coaches make their comments, it is up to the contestant's coach to decide who is the winner of the battle. The winner advances to the Live shows. Coaches usually only have steals in this round which they can steal an artist from another team. However, these are limited. \nLive Shows.\nFinally, The remaining artists give final performances. A certain number of contestants stay while the rest are eliminated. Winners are often picked by letting the viewers in the country decide who should win and who should be eliminated until only 1 contestant remains. They are declared the winner. The winner and their coach and artist celebrate with the host, and they may win a cash prize and some random prize(Usually associated with music). Some seasons feature the Instant Save.\nList Of Coaches.\nIn no particular order:"}

For example, in ordinary arithmetic, addition on real numbers has closure: whenever one adds two numbers, the answer is a number. The same is true of multiplication. Division does \"not\" have closure, because division by 0 is not defined. In the natural numbers, subtraction does not have closure, but in the integers, subtraction does have closure. Subtraction of two numbers can produce a negative number, which is not a natural number, but is an integer.\nOne can sometimes make closure of a mathematical object by including new elements to it. The integers are a closure of the natural numbers by including negative numbers. The real numbers are a closure of the rational numbers by including square roots of positive numbers. The complex numbers are a closure of the real numbers by including square roots of negative numbers. Since every non-zero polynomial has a root in the complex numbers, the complex numbers are also the algebraic closure of the real numbers. One can express this relationship as formula_1.\nSometimes, if one includes an element to make closure, it makes more changes. For example, if one includes infinity, formula_2 (that is, closure of division), the laws of addition and subtraction are changed. There is no inversion of addition for formula_3.\nOrdinary closure is called finite closure. There is also infinite closure. The definition of a topological space mentions infinite closure. Open spaces have (finite) closure of intersection. Open sets have infinite closure of union. That is, in mathematical notation, if A0, and A1 and ... A\"n\" ... are open sets, then B and C are open sets:\nIn point-set topology, given a set \"S\", the set containing all points of \"S\" along with its limit points is called the topological closure of \"S\". This is sometimes written as formula_6. The closure of \"S\" is also the smallest closed set containing \"S\"."}

Today it is still a necessity for farmers, ranchers and those who raise domestic animals.\nHerds.\nSome animals instinctively gather together as a herd. A group of animals fleeing a predator will herd together for . Some predators, such as wolves and dogs, have instinctive herding abilities that come from primitive hunting instincts. But there can be a fine line between chasing and herding. Dogs that show basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding and stock dog trials. It's a sport that dogs and their owners can enjoy together.\nHerding is used in agriculture to manage domesticated animals. Herding can be performed by people or dogs trained to control the movement of livestock under the direction of a person. Animals such as cattle, sheep and goats are commonly herded by humans and dogs. Also herd dogs may be used to gather and herd turkey, geese, ducks and chickens.\nHerd dogs.\nOriginally dogs were used to both herd and guard domestic animals. Over time dogs were bred to specialize in one or the other. Herd guardians or guard dogs became the 24-hour protector of the flock. Herd dogs were developed to keep the herd together. Herding dogs are critical to Australian and British sheep farms. \nHerd dog breeds.\nHerding dog breeds are typically intelligent, all-work and full of energy.\nHerding occupations.\nPeople who work with agricultural animals have different occupational names. This is based on the type of animal they work with or names that vary by country."}

Races had been held on the hard sandy beach since 1902. Racing on the beach ended in 1959 when Daytona International Speedway opened. Bill France, Jr. was behind the construction of the speedway. The first race was won by Lee Petty in a field of 59 cars. In 1962, the first major race on the road course was held. It was won by Grand Prix driver Dan Gurney driving a red Lotus. Near the end of the race and with a 2 minute lead, his engine failed. He coasted across the finish line to win.\nBy the 1960s, the sportscar race was made into a 24 hour race. This required multiple drivers for each car and involved a long period of racing at night. Both races grew in popularity in the 1970s and 80s. Today the Daytona 500 is an important race in NASCAR. The Rolex 24, which is named that because it is sponsored by the Rolex watch company, is an important endurance race."}

They added larger Sikorsky S-43s six years later for more passengers and mail service.\nName change to Hawaiian Airlines.\nIn 1941 Inter-Island Airways Ltd. changed its name to Hawaiian Airlines. In 1966, Hawaiian started using jets to fly between the islands. The jets were much faster and quieter than the propeller planes it was using. In 1984, Hawaiian began flying between Honolulu and the South Pacific. It also started flying between Honolulu and the U.S. West Coast.\nAircraft and logo change.\nIn 1966, Hawaiian added all-jet aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9. Flying time between islands was reduced to 20\u201330 minutes. In 2002-03, Hawaiian replaced its planes with better ones. The new planes used less fuel to fly the same distances. It also changed the design on the tails of its planes. The airline also started flying to more locations. Today it flies approximately 212 flights a day."}

Maryland (1819) was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The US state of Maryland decided to tax all banknotes by banks not chartered by the state of Maryland. The only bank in Maryland at the time that did not have a state charter was the Second Bank of the United States. The bank was a branch of the federal bank established in 1816. \nBackground.\nThe United States Constitution did not provide for judicial review of laws and court decisions. It was a power the US Supreme court assumed (took) for itself with its first landmark decision. In the decision \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803) the court established its \"power to say what the law is\". The court gave itself the right to interpret the constitution.\nIn 1819 it was evident Maryland was targeting the US Bank. Most state banks resented the special privileges given to the US bank by Congress. The depression of 1818 was hurting state banks. The state charged a tax on the US Bank located in Baltimore. The branch manager was James McCulloch. He had refused to pay the state of Maryland $15,000 USD in taxes on the US Bank's currency. At that time states were battling with the Federal government over which had power over the other. Maryland sued James McCulloch. The state court upheld the decision he had to pay the tax. The court of appeals upheld the decision. McCulloch appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819.\nThe decision.\nThere were two questions the court needed to decide. Did Congress have the power to charter a federal bank? The next question was did Maryland have the right to tax a branch of the federal government. Was this constitutional? The court ruled that the federal government did have the power to set up a federal bank. Also, that a state did not have the right to tax the federal government.\nResults of the decision.\nFor the Second Bank of the United States, the decision was short-lived. In 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected President of the United States. It was a victory for states' rights. Jackson vetoed the bill to recharter the bank. But the Civil war effectively ended states rights. The constitutional changes that followed favored a strong federal government. In the 20th century, \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" was the basis for the federal government being strongly involved in the economy. It set the legal precedent that the federal law was more important than state law in all matters. "}

His professor, August Wilhelm von Hofmann, was the first director of the Royal College of Chemistry in London.\nIn one attempt, Perkin oxidized aniline using potassium dichromate. This failed, but cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed the alcohol had turned purple.\nThe dye turned out to be suitable for silk and other textiles.

It is about friends who accidentally discover a way to time travel. The movie was released in 2004.\nShane Carruth, who made the movie by himself, also plays the starring role, because he could not find anyone else to do it. Some of his family members and friends are also in it. The only actor he hired was David Sullivan.\n\"Primer\" has a confusing plot. The dialogue is difficult to understand. Carruth decided not to make the language simpler for the audience. The movie won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. It then played in a small number of theatres in the United States. It is also available on DVD. It is now popular as a cult movie. People still talk and write about how to figure out the plot.\nPlot.\nFour engineers, who are friends, work together during the day. At night, they run a side business from Aaron's (Shane Carruth) garage. With the money they make, they do research for their own inventions. Two drop out after an argument over what to work on next, leaving Aaron and Abe (David Sullivan).\nAaron and Abe work on a machine that will make an object weigh less. This would happen by changing the effects of gravity. The machine seems to work as planned, but it has a side effect. An object ( a Weeble) left in the machine uses 1300 times the amount of time the machine was turned on for. Abe thinks that objects inside the box travel over and over, from the time the box was turned on to the time it was turned off.\nAbe secretly builds a machine large enough to put himself in. After using it to go back in time to earlier that morning, he proves how it works to Aaron. Abe and Aaron build another machine so they each will have one to travel in. Abe and Aaron start using the time machines to make money in the stock market. After a while, they get riskier with their travels and begin to try to change other events.\nThomas Granger is the father of Abe's girlfriend Rachel. Somehow he discovers that the time machines exist. He time travels, but because he does not do it correctly, he ends up in a coma. Aaron thinks that, at some unknown time in the future, Granger entered the box (for unknown reasons). This changed the timeline in bad ways. Abe is frightened by this and decides that time travel is too dangerous to keep doing. He tries to stop his past self from using the machine any more, so he won't get any bad effects. He uses a \"failsafe\" machine, which he had already built secretly and kept running in a hidden location. He travels back farther in time than his first trip (four days) and before he had told Aaron about time travel. He thinks this will repair any problems.\nBut, Aaron had found out about this failsafe box and used it to try to get control of the timelines for both of them. Meeting at a park bench, Aaron shows Abe that he has been using a recording to say their conversation from an earlier time to fool him. Aaron says he fought and was drugged by an earlier double (or copy) of himself, who used the failsafe to come back and make the recordings. This Aaron wants to travel back in time to undo the events of a party. A party crasher had tried to shoot Rachel Granger. Abe agrees to try to change the events of the party with Aaron. The two succeed, but it is not clear how many times of travelling back it takes.\nNow, Abe and Aaron no longer trust each other, so their friendship is ruined. Aaron and Abe fight. Abe warns Aaron never to return or interfere with their doubles. Abe stays behind to continue to try to keep the original Abe and Aaron from ever using the machines for time travel. Aaron travels to France by air and begins to build a room-sized time machine with a group of workers there.\nMaking the movie.\nCarruth has a college degree in mathematics and worked as an engineer. While writing the dialogue, Carruth studied physics, so the conversations would sound real. He used the short phrases and jargon that scientists use when they are working. The time machine itself is a plain gray box. It has an electronic \"hum\" made with a mechanical grinder and a car engine. The movie was shot in industrial parks and little houses in the suburbs.\n\"Primer\" was filmed near Dallas, Texas in 2001. The scenes in the public library where Abe and Aaron made their Internet stock trades were shot in the Richardson Public Library. The time machines were running in a storage facility. An airport scene was shot before the September 11 attacks in the United States. This is why the scene shows barely any security. The actors are allowed to walk to windows to watch planes leaving.\nThe movie was made for only $7,000 US and a crew of five. Carruth decided to play Aaron himself after having trouble finding any actors who could \"break ... the habit of filling each line with so much drama\". He also did all the production work on the movie, including writing the music.\nAfter the movie was made, Carruth took two years to edit \"Primer\". He said he found this so difficult, he almost gave up several times. The movie was first shown to audiences and judges at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004."}

It is in a group with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5(OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay.\nThe name is after Kao-Ling, a village near Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China. The name entered English in 1727 from the French \"kaolin\", used in a Jesuit priest's reports from Jingdezhen. In Africa, kaolin is sometimes known as \"kalaba\" or calaba.\nKaolinite is a soft, earthy, usually white mineral (dioctahedral phyllosilicate clay). It is produced by the chemical weathering of aluminium silicate minerals like feldspar. In many parts of the world, it is colored pink-orange-red by iron oxide, giving it a distinct rust hue. Lighter concentrations yield white, yellow or light orange colors. Alternating layers are sometimes found, as at Providence Canyon State Park in Georgia, United States. Commercial grades of kaolin are supplied and transported as dry powder, semi-dry noodle or as liquid slurry.\nKaolinite is said to have a low shrink-swell capacity and a low cation-exchange capacity, which makes it ideal for various industrial applications."}

It was at that time that the British Kennel Club recognized the Pyrenean Mountain Dog as a breed. In the 1930s two puppies were brought to Needham, Massachusetts and bred which helped to save the species.

He used anaesthesia and medical hygiene. He is a founder of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854. His findings caused changes in the water and sewage systems of London. This led to similar changes in other cities, and a great improvement in general public health around the world.\nIn 1837 Snow began working at the Westminster Hospital. Admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the University of London in December 1844 and was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1850.\nAnaesthesia.\nSnow was one of the first to study dosages for the use of ether and chloroform as surgical anaesthetics. This let patients to undergo surgery and obstetrics without distress and pain. He personally administered chloroform to Queen Victoria when she gave birth to the last two of her nine children, Leopold in 1853 and Beatrice in 1857. This lead to wider acceptance of obstetric anaesthesia.\nCholera.\nSnow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of 'foul air'. \nBy talking to local residents, he found the source of the outbreak was the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not \"conclusively\" prove its danger. However, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough. The local council disabled the well pump by removing its handle. This action is usually credited with ending the outbreak, but Snow saw that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline:\nSnow also showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes, so causing the cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It was the founding event of the science of epidemiology.\nSnow died young after a stroke. Health in Victorian London was vastly improved by engineering works for sewage treatment and water supply. This included building huge pipes under ground which kept sewage and water supplies separate. This system was so successful that it lasted until the later part of the 20th century.\nVictorian London became one of the few large cities in the world to be free of epidemics carried by the water supply. The British later built the water and sewage systems in many other countries, especially those in, or connected with, the British Empire (Cairo, Khartoum, New Delhi and so on). The growth in population has made the water unsafe again in many places, but round about 1900 a clean water supply was available in many parts of the world. All this was a consequence of Snow's work, and the engineering methods of Sir Joseph Bazalgette."}

However, the tallest spires today are secular places of business or hotels, such as The Shard.\nAs an architectural ornament, spires are most often found on Christian churches."}

It is from the Latin \"regnum\" meaning kingdom or rule. Some of the oldest dating systems were in regnal years. A regnal year usually begins on the date of a monarch's accession to the throne. Year one is counted from day one to the end of the first year of a monarch's reign. Then a second year of rule, a third, and so on. They would not have a zero year of rule. It is displayed as an ordinal, not a cardinal number.\nDate problems.\nEvery year of a monarch's reign falls within two calendar years, unless the reign began on the first day of the calendar year. When converting a regnal year in history to a calendar year, this can cause an error of one year. In England, from the 10th century until the late 13th century, the practice was to count the regnal year from the date of coronation. This was usually a later date than when a monarch was proclaimed king or queen. The current practice of dating from the date of accession began in the late 13th century when the heir was out of the country. Henry III of England died on 16 November 1272 which some sources date as the beginning of Edward I of England's rule. His reign actually began when he was proclaimed king at the New Temple on 20 November 1272. Here the date error between sources would be only four days."}

Kestrels hover about over open country, and swoop down on prey, usually small mammals, lizards or large insects. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the wing. In addition, kestrels have much brown in their plumage.\nKestrels can fly in stationary air, even indoors in barns. While hovering they face towards any slight headwind. This leads to the common kestrel being called a \"windhover\" in some areas.\nUnusually for falcons, plumage often differs between male and female, although as usual with monogamous raptors the female is slightly larger than the male. This allows a pair to eat slightly different prey on their home range. Kestrels are bold, and have adapted well to humans. They nest in buildings and hunt by main roads. Kestrels do not build their own nests, but use nests built by other birds.\nMost kestrels form a distinct clade among the falcons, as suggested by comparison of mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequence data and morphology. This clade diverged from other \"Falco\" around the Miocene to Pliocene about 7\u20133.5 million years ago (mya). The most basal \"true\" kestrels are three species from Africa and its surroundings.\nAbout 2.5\u20132 mya, the main lineage of true kestrels emerged. This too seems to have evolved in Africa and subsequently spread across the Old World until they reached Australia some time during the Middle Pleistocene, less than one million years ago. This group contains several taxa found on Indian Ocean islands. A group of three mainly grey species from Africa and Madagascar are usually considered kestrels by their general shape and habits, but are probably distinct from the true kestrels discussed above.\nThere is only one kestrel in the Americas, with a wide range of habitats. It is \"Falco sparverius\". The male is more brightly coloured than usual for kestrels, with a reddish back and tail."}

These include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed. In general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons.\nHistory.\nCytochromes were described in 1884 as respiratory pigments. They include (haemoglobin, myoglobin, haemocyanin, haemoerythrin and chlorocruorin. In the 1920s, Keilin rediscovered these respiratory pigments. He called them the cytochromes, or \u201ccellular pigments\u201d, and classified them as haem proteins.\nTypes.\nSeveral kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by spectroscopy. Three types of cytochrome are distinguished by their prosthetic groups.\nIn mitochondria and chloroplasts, these cytochromes are often combined in electron transport and related metabolic pathways."}

It is a branch of mathematics that studies the conditions under which order must appear. \nExamples.\nA typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that\nis then cut into pieces. How big must the original structure be, so that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? This idea can be defined as partition regularity.\nFor example, consider a complete graph of order \"n\"; that is, there are \"n\" vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle. Now colour every edge red or blue. How large must \"n\" be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? It turns out that the answer is 6. \nAnother way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are either (a) mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or (b) mutual strangers (each one does not know either of the other two). \nRamsey theory is now a complete branch of mathematics."}

General consensus is that the number is even. Even numbers are defined to be integer multiples of two. That way, the numbers two, four and six are even, because they are one times two, two times two, and three times two. With that explanation, zero is also even, because it is zero times two. \nAnother explanation is from number theory: The integers are arranged in such a way that even numbers are followed by odd ones, and odd ones by even ones. Zero is preceded by minus one, and followed by one. Both numbers are odd. So it must be even.\nThere is also a problem: The term \"even\" meaning \"integer multiple of two\" is a convention; people agreed on it. It is not a formal definition. Another case where people used a convention they agreed on was that of prime number: Before the 20th century, there were many inconsistent definitions of prime: Mathematicians such as Goldbach, Lambert, Legendre, Cayley, and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime. The modern definition of \"prime number\" is \"positive integer with exactly 2 factors\", so 1 is not prime. This definition is rational: it naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime\nIt would be possible to redefine \"even\" in a way that no longer includes zero. However, in this case, the new definition would make it more difficult to state theorems concerning the even numbers. Already the effect can be seen in the algebraic rules governing even and odd numbers. The most relevant rules concern addition, subtraction, and multiplication:\nInserting appropriate values into the left sides of these rules, one can produce 0 on the right sides:\nThe above rules would therefore be incorrect if zero were not even. At best they would have to be modified. For example, one test study guide asserts that even numbers are characterized as integer multiples of two, but zero is \"neither even nor odd\". Accordingly, the guide's rules for even and odd numbers contain exceptions:\nMaking an exception for zero in the definition of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero."}

Here, some stripes of a black and white grating are replaced by gray rectangles (see Fig). All gray bars usually have same color and opacity. The brightness of the gray pieces appear to shift toward the brightness of the top and bottom bordering stripes, that is, the gray bars with horizontal black regions on their top and bottom appear darker and those with white regions on their top and bottom appear lighter. But this does not match with what lateral inhibition predicts. This illusion is mostly described for grayscale. A similar illusion occurs for colored patches. This is known as Munker-White's illusion or Munker's illusion.\nLateral inhibition result for White's effect.\nThe amount of each bipolar cell response depends on the amount of the stimulation it receives from the receptor. Neighboring cells decrease this response. This is called lateral inhibition.\nLateral inhibition cannot explain White's illusion. In Figure 2.1 lateral inhibition sent by black cells A and C should make cell O lighter; in Figure 2.2 lateral inhibition sent by white cells A and C should make cell O darker.\nRules suggested to describe optical illusions such as simultaneous brightness contrast illusion, such as Wallach's ratio rule cannot explain White's illusion. These rules suggest that cell O in figure 2.1 receives less inhibition that cell O in figure 2.2. So, the cell O in figure 2.1 should be lighter than cell O in the other figure. However, the opposite case happens. \nWhite and White (1985) concluded that at a higher spatial frequency the grating of White's illusion could be described by brightness assimilation. They also concluded that at lower spatial frequencies White's illusion is still present.\nBelongingness.\nThe belongingness theory has been given as an explanation of White's illusion. Belongingness means that we perceive things depending on its surroundings. According to belongingness theory, the lightness of rectangle A is influenced by the white bars that surround it. Similarly, the rectangle B on the right side is surrounded by the dark bars. So, the lightness of rectangle B is affected by the dark background. As a result, area A which rests on the white background appears darker than area B which rests on the dark background.\nNot all scientists accept the belongingness theory. They say that when talking about the background, it is the same as lateral inhibition."}

This increases perception. For example, in vision, it helps in differentiating edges. It occurs primarily in visual processes. But it has also been seen in tactile, auditory, and even olfactory processing. Cells that use lateral inhibition are mainly present in cerebral cortex and thalamus. They make up lateral inhibitory networks (LINs). Artificial sensory systems have artificial lateral inhibition built in them. Examples are vision chips, hearing systems, and optical mice."}

The adventure is usually an exciting undertaking involving risk and physical danger. Author Malins describes adventure fiction as the story \"of the hero\u2014individual or group\u2014overcoming obstacles and dangers and accomplishing some important and moral mission.\" The characters in an adventure fiction are highly sympathetic. They are also ones the reader can easily relate to. There has to be a conflict to overcome and a clever villain to stop.\nThe hero.\nA key part of many adventure fictions is the hero. In most stories the hero has to succeed. At the same time the hero may be the least interesting character in the story. The hero is often timid, submissive and easily pushed around. The hero may be a superhero, a spy, a detective or even an antihero. But the hero manages to meet the challenge. All great adventure heroes seem to find the ability to beat their enemies or win over hostile environments.\nSometimes the villain wins. In Edgar Allan Poe's story \"The Cask of Amontillado\", the villain is the narrator of the story. Sometimes the villain wins only to be confronted again in a sequel.\nThe genre.\nIn many adventure fictions, the adventure takes place in foreign lands or exotic places. One of the earliest adventure fiction writers was Daniel Defoe. His stories of \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Captain Singleton\" helped set the standards for the adventure fiction genre. Another British author Sir Walter Scott built on the formula. He combined history with adventure fiction. His historical romance novels \"Waverley\", \"Rob Roy\" and \"Ivanhoe\" were classic adventures. They helped the reader understand the hero and gave him a code of chivalry. French author Alexandre Dumas wrote \"The Three Musketeers\", \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and \"Man in the Iron Mask\". These were very popular in Europe and America. His stories had strong elements of revenge and forgiveness. James Fenimore Cooper in his adventure stories \"The Pioneers\", \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and \"The Pathfinder\" were set in exotic new world locations. But Cooper changed the aristocratic hero into one who was noble even though not born into the nobility."}

Therefore, the silver is usually alloyed with copper to give it strength while keeping the ductility and beauty of the precious metal. Other metals can replace the copper, to improve various properties of the basic sterling alloy such as increasing resistance to tarnish. These replacement metals include germanium, zinc and platinum, as well as a variety of other additives, including silicon and boron. Alloys such as argentium silver have appeared in recent decades. Argentium silver has some germanium added, and resists tarnishing well.\nThe first legal definition of sterling silver appeared in 1275.

After nearing bankruptcy in 1986, the fish market owner and employees decided to become \"world famous\", changing their way of doing business by introducing their flying fish, games, and customer performances. Four years later, they were featured repeatedly in the national media and television shows. The store is now a popular tourist destination in Seattle, attracting up to 10,000 daily visitors, and is often billed as world-famous.\nHistory.\nThe Pike Place Fish Market was purchased in 1965 by John Yokoyama. Yokoyama was a former employee of the fish market, who bought the store to make enough money to afford the car payments on his new Buick Riviera. At first, Pike Place Fish Market was unknown outside of the Seattle area. Yokoyama and his staff decided to change that in a meeting with a business coach in 1986. Prior to the meeting, the Pike Place Fish Market was near to bankruptcy. Consultant, Jim Bergquist, was helping them to conceive of ways to save the business. A fish market employee at the meeting suggested that they not only save the business, but make it \"world famous\". They had the idea of flying and throwing fish and having games with customers. They thought that staff were enjoying their work so that customers would as well. In an interview, Yokoyama stated, \"We took a stand that we were going to become world famous. We just said it and it became so.\"\nFour years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games were held in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market discovered the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on \"Good Morning America\". The business and its employees were being filmed by various movie crews, and being featured in many magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front of as many as 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful. This has led to their being featured in motivational books.\nA popular feature at the Pike Place Fish Market is a fish which sometimes is made to \"snap\" at customers. In 1991, CNN named the Pike Place Fish Market as one of the three most fun places to work in America.\nFlying fish.\nThe Pike Place Fish Market is best known for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the shopping area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order, which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping. Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition. While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish. At times, the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. Above the areas in which they throw fish, the market hangs a sign that reads, \"Caution: Low Flying Fish\".\nMovies, books and popular culture.\nIn 1998, the Pike Place Fish Market was the subject of a documentary movie and accompanying book, \"FISH! Philosophy.\" The Pike Place Fish Market has also been the setting for several best-selling corporate training videos, the aforementioned \"FISH!\", and also \"FISH!Sticks\", which have been used by companies such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Sprint Nextel, Southwest Airlines, Sainsbury's, Saturn, and Scottish and Southern Energy, for employee training. The Pike Place Fish Market has been featured in a variety of television shows and commercials. These include a Spike Lee Levis jeans commercial; MTV's \"The Real World\"; NBC's \"Frasier\", and ABC's \"Good Morning America\". In movies, it has appeared in \"Free Willy\"."}

Stability was achieved by grooving the undersides of the stones so that they interlocked, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, with everything held in place by an encircling 'frame'. Many different colored stones, particularly marbles, were used, along with semiprecious, and even precious stones. \nThe technique first appeared in Rome in the 16th century. It reached its peak in Florence. Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones. Typically the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples have the image is in low relief.\nThere are a number of similar techniques which should not be called pietra dura. The English term \"Florentine mosaic\" is sometimes used for the work of Giovanni Montelatici (1864-1930). He was an Italian Florentine artist whose brilliant work has been distributed across the world by tourists and collectors.\nPietra dura is also different from mosaics because stones are mostly much larger and cut to a shape suiting their place in the image, not all of roughly equal size and shape as in mosaic. In pietra dura, the stones are not cemented together with grout, and works in pietra dura are often portable. Nor should it be confused with micromosaics, a form of mosaic using very small tesserae of the same size to create images for Byzantine icons, and later for furniture panels."}

A pink cat is not a color found in nature. But several pink cats have been reported about in the news media. Sometimes the cat colour has changed to pink with chemicals or dyes. There are also several fictional pink cats in popular culture.\nReal pink cats.\nIn September 2005, a cat named Brumas roamed away from his owners in Launceston, Cornwall. When he came back after a short time, his fur was coloured pink. No one ever figured out the cause of the colour change. Brumas was taken to the RSPCA to be tested. He did not have any toxins.\nIn September 2010, a cat with dyed pink fur was found in Swindon, South West England. The RSPCA said the dyeing was a \"sick prank\". Even though they tried to wash the colour out of the cat's fur, it stayed pink. The cat did not have any signs of side-effects or harm. The event made worldwide news. Soon the owner told the truth. She said that the cat had been dyed pink using food colouring because she was a fan of the colour. She said the act \"seemed like a good idea. I always wanted a pink animal - a bit like my hair\". She said she read the instructions carefully and the food colouring could not be harmful because it was safe for humans to eat. The RSPCA decided not to arrest her for harming her animal.\nIn May 2011, four kittens were found in a concrete factory in Redruth, Cornwall. One kitten had pink fur. A cat rescue group named \"Cats Protection\", tried to wash out the colour with shampoo, but could not.\nPollution from a steel factory in Port Talbot, Wales, has turned cats both pink and grey.\nCats having pink patches are found in Bulgaria. The color is probably a genetic mutation and is very close to orange. They are usually pink-white bicolor; or pink-blue-white or pink-black-white calico cats.\nFictional pink cats.\nThe Pink Panther is a cartoon cat that was created by Friz Freleng. He is seen in the opening titles of the Peter Sellers movies with his own theme music. He also had his own cartoon show. Animation historian Jerry Beck has said the cartoon cat is \"anti-authority\u00a0\u2013 he's cool yet he's pink\".\nThe character of the children's television series\" Bagpuss\" was a pink cat. The Bagpuss puppet was really supposed to be an orange marmalade colour. When the puppet was made, it was dyed pink by mistake. \nAnother children's television show, \"Roobarb and Custard\", had a pink cat named Custard. Roobarb, the dog, was yellow. This program was shown on BBC television in England. The characters acted similar to the animated cat and mouse, \"Tom and Jerry.\"\nIn 2014, a Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman, made a tall pink cat for an exhibition in Century Park, Shanghai.\n from BoJack Horseman is a pink cat."}

It was against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies. It lasted from 23 October until 10 November 1956. It was the first major threat to Soviet control since the USSR's forces drove out the Nazis at the end of World War II and took over Eastern Europe. Despite the failure of the uprising, it was highly influential. It played a role in the fall of the Soviet Union decades later.\nPrelude.\nAt the end of World War II Hungary was liberated from the Nazis. It was occupied by the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Army. Hungary's communists were led by General Secretary M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi and backed by Joseph Stalin. The communists destroyed all political opposition. In 1949 Hungary officially became the People\u2019s Republic of Hungary. R\u00e1kosi was an oppressive ruler. He exiled, imprisoned or killed over 300,000 Hungarians. After Stalin died, the soviet communists replaced R\u00e1kosi with Imre Nagy. They thought his softer approach would win them popularity. But the Kremlin decided he had become too popular. R\u00e1kosi was returned to power in April 1955. His secret police, the AVO, carried out R\u00e1kosi's oppressive orders again. Eventually, the Hungarian people got tired of their bad living standards and protested.\nWhen the revolt broke out in October 1956, the Hungarian revolt was very sudden. Nobody had any idea it would sweep the country and break out everywhere all at once. However, there were warning signs that trouble was coming. The Communist Party in Hungary had lost much of its authority and respect. In July of 1956 R\u00e1kosi was removed again as leader of the party. He was sent back to the Soviet Union.\nResults.\n2,500 Hungarians died and thousands were imprisoned. Hundreds of Soviet troops died. 200,000 fled Hungary. Communists in the Western Bloc argued about the Soviet Union intervening to stop the uprising."}

Substitutions can be made for many reasons. Sometimes, they are made to replace a player who has become tired or injured. Substitutes can also replace a player who is playing poorly, or can be for tactics. For example, substitute strikers can be brought on for defenders if the team needs to attack. The term \"super-sub\" refers to a substitution made by the manager that saves the game. This is generally done by scoring one or more late goals. The goals can equalize or win the team the match. Players who have been called \"super-subs\" include David Fairclough for Liverpool, Adam Le Fondre for Reading, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez for Manchester United, and Edin D\u017eeko for Manchester City among others."}

When it is still wet, it can be removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution.\nAnother advantage of this type of oil paint is that it dries faster than traditional oils (but slower than acrylics). Also, painters can control the speed of drying with supplementary products from artistic paint suppliers."}

He was an important person in the movement toward the Italian unification.\nCavour was born in Turin during Napoleonic rule. Until 1831, he was a military officer. Later, he decided to travel in Europe to learn more about the effects of the Industrial Revolution. The trips helped him to know and understand the principles of the British Liberal system.\nAfter four years, he returned to Piedmont. He took charge of agriculture and the economy in general. He worked for the spread of schools. During that time, his business and banking activities made him one of the richest men in the Piedmont.\nFrom 1832 to 1848, Cavour was the mayor of Grinzane (now called \"Grinzane Cavour\" to honor him). In 1847, he founded the newspaper \"Il Risorgimento\". According to him, the process of economic and social development, which he had promoted for years, could be implemented only after a deep restructuring of political institutions.\nIn 1850, Cavour became famous because he advocating the \"Siccardi Law\" that diminished the privileges of the Catholic clergy. In the same year, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Massimo D'Azeglio, chose him as Minister of Agriculture, Trade and Navy. Later he also became Minister of Finance. After D'Azeglio resigned on November 4, 1852, Cavour became Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\nCavour's political program wanted to become the Kingdom of Sardinia a constitutional State based on moderate and progressive liberalism and so he dedicated himself to a radical renewal of the economy. He modernised and supported agriculture, strengthened the industrial system and promoted trade with the major European powers. However, his liberal program was criticized by both the \"Historical Left\", which cared for the poorest citizens, both the \"Historical Right\", which considered him as a destroyer of conservative traditions.\nIn 1858, he signed a treaty of alliance between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the French Empire against the Austrian Empire. The next year, the Second Italian War of Independence, the Piedmontese and the French defeated the Austrians, who then controlled Italy.\nAfter the Armistice of Villafranca and Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition in the South (1860-1861), the unification of Italy was completed. Cavour became the first president of the united Italy. He was also the first Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was the leader of the Liberal parliamentary group. He died of an illness in Turin."}

It is mostly found in aquatic or amphibious animals. This is because water helps the signals travel better than air. Some exceptions are the echidnas, cockroaches and bees. Electroreception is used in electrolocation.\nResearch.\nUntil recently, people thought only vertebrates had electroreception. However, research has shown that bees use electroreception to find flowers. Electroreception is found in lampreys, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, catfishes, gymnotiformes, monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean. Fish have electroreception from their lateral lines. In most groups electroreception is used for predation. The Western long-beaked echidna has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill. Its relative, the duck-billed platypus, has 40,000.\nElectrolocation.\nElectroreceptive animals use this sense to find where objects are. This is important in ecological niches where the animal cannot see. For example, animals cannot use their vision in caves, in murky water, and at night. Many fish use electric fields to find buried prey. Some shark pups \"freeze\" when they feel the electric signal of their predators."}

He is best known as the founder and longtime lead guitarist (1965-1995) of the band the Grateful Dead. Garcia was seen as an icon of the Hippie counterculture of the 1960s. He was considered an almost mythic hero to his fans, called deadheads. Garcia was an innovator who was constantly experimenting with sound. He was one of the most recorded guitar players of all time.\nEarly life.\nJerry Garcia was born August 1, 1942, in San Francisco, California. His father was Jose Ramon Garcia, a Spanish immigrant. His mother, Ruth Marie Clifford, named him after her favorite composer, Jerome Kern. His father was a jazz musician who bought a bar. As a child Garcia took piano lessons. When he was four he lost part of a finger chopping wood. A year later his father drowned. When his mother took over the bar, Garcia went to live with his grandparents. They introduced him to the Grand Ole Opry. This along with his brother's collection of Chuck Berry records gave him an interest in country music. In 1953 his mother remarried and Garcia moved back with her. Garcia attended several different schools in and around San Francisco. But he had little interest in school until 1957 when he attended the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). At age 15 his mother gave him a guitar. In high school he played in several bands. At age 17 he quit school. He joined the Army in 1960 but was given a general discharge a few months later.\nMusic career.\nGarcia returned to San Francisco. He spent time teaching acoustic guitar and playing bluegrass music. He met up with poet Robert Hunter. Together they started playing in the city's coffeehouses. Hunter later became the lyricist for the Grateful Dead and Garcia's lifelong songwriting partner. Garcia started becoming famous around San Francisco between 1962 and 1964. He was known for his Folk and bluegrass performances. Garcia tried a new drug LSD for the first time in 1964. From that time on he became a lifelong advocate of psychedelic drugs. Musically he began experimenting outside the basic folk music formula and trying out new styles of music. This included jug band, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. A year later they changed their name to the \"Warlocks\". \nThe Warlocks soon became the Grateful Dead. Garcia found the name in a dictionary. While Garcia was the frontman, the band always operated as a leaderless democracy. Garcia continued to experiment musically. He became known for his extended guitar improvisations. He also worked on numerous side projects and frequently sat in with other groups. Jefferson Airplane, in their 1967 album \"Surrealistic Pillow\", credited him as the group's \"spiritual adviser\". In 1969, he and John \"Marmaduke\" Dawson founded the country rock band New Riders of the Purple Sage. The New Riders, or NRPS, became the opening act for the Grateful Dead. At this time Garcia was experimenting with the pedal steel guitar for both NRPS and the Dead.\nFor the next few years Garcia and the Dead built their reputation based on their live shows. He was a guest performer with other groups. By 1970 the Dead began moving back to their bluegrass, folk and country roots. Garcia began doing solo recordings often accompanied by keyboardist Merl Saunders. In 1973 Garcia was a founding member of the bluegrass supergroup Old and in the Way. Garcia formed the rock band Legion of Mary (band) in 1974. In 1975 he founded the Jerry Garcia Band. It became his most important side project until his death.\nBy 1974 the Grateful Dead members began to go their own ways. Garcia continued making solo albums and appearances. The Dead began touring again in 1976. By the early 1980s Garcia was heavily addicted to drugs. In 1985 Garcia was arrested and sent to a drug treatment center. In 1986, while on tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Bob Dylan, Garcia collapsed. He went into a diabetic coma and was hospitalized. Garcia returned to touring with the Dead. In 1987 the Grateful Dead had their first Top-10 hit, \"Touch of Grey\".\nDeath and legacy.\nOn August 9, 1995, after years of health problems and drug abuse, Jerry Garcia died of heart failure. He was 53 years old. He had checked into a drug treatment center and his body was found during an early morning bed check."}

It works at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as \"restriction sites\". To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each strand of the DNA double helix.\nThese enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and defend them against invading viruses, which are bacteriophages.\nInside a prokaryote, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up \"foreign\" DNA in a process called \"restriction\". The host DNA is protected by another enzyme which protects the host DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes are the restriction modification system. It is the earliest and simplest immune system. They are also a kind of selfish, mobile genetic element.\nOver 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more than 600 of these are available commercially. These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories, and are a vital tool in molecular cloning.\nOrigins.\nRestriction enzymes probably evolved from a common ancestor and became widespread by horizontal gene transfer. In addition, there is growing evidence that restriction endonucleases evolved as a selfish genetic element."}

In 1980, two articles in the journal \"Nature\" expanded and discussed the concept. According to one of these articles:\nNormal genetically functional DNA might be seen as \"replicating entities\" that effect their replication by manipulating the cell that they control. In contrast, units of selfish DNA may exploit existing mechanisms in the cell, and multiply without affecting the fitness of the organism in other respects.\nThere is no sharp boundary between the concepts of selfish DNA and genetically functional DNA. Often it also is difficult to see if a unit of noncoding DNA is functionally important or not; or if important, in what way. What is more, it is not always easy to distinguish between some instances of selfish DNA and some types of viruses.\nHistory of the idea.\nThe idea that some genetic elements might not be useful to the organism is not a new one. In 1928, a Russian geneticist reported an X chromosome in \"Drosophila obscura\". He claimed that the resulting female-biased sex ratio might drive a population extinct.\nIn 1941 it was first suggested that there might be a conflict between normal inherited nuclear genes from both parents and mitochondrial genes from one parent (the female). It could lead to cytoplasmic male sterility in plants.\nAround the same time, several other examples of selfish genetic elements were reported. For example, a maize geneticist described how chromosomal knobs led to female meiotic drive in maize. Meiotic drive is when one copy of a gene is passed on to offspring more than the expected 50% of the time.\nThe Swedish botanist and cytogeneticist Gunnar \u00d6stergren in 1945 noted how chromosomes may spread in a population because of their own \u201dparasitic\u201d nature. Discussing B chromosomes in plants he wrote: \u201dIn many cases these chromosomes have no useful function at all to the species carrying them, but that they often lead an exclusively parasitic existence \u2026 [B chromosomes] need not be useful for the plants. They need only be useful to themselves.\u201d - Gunnar \u00d6stergren.\nThen, in the early 1950s, Barbara McClintock published a series of papers describing the existence of \"transposable elements\". These are among the most successful selfish genetic elements. The discovery of transposable elements led to her being awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1983."}

In 1822 he graduated in the Military Academy of Turin; then began a military career, which led him to become general in 1856. In the Kingdom of Sardinia he was twice Minister of War in the governments led by Massimo D'Azeglio and Camillo Cavour.\nIn 1854 La Marmora made a law that improved the quality of the troops, created new academies for officers, retouched the recruitment system, bringing to 60,000 Army soldiers (of which only a quarter in active service, while the rest evaded the lever paying a substitute), doubled the units of riflemen and strengthened the light cavalry at the expense of heavy. Even the artillery, health and administrative apparatus were renovated, as well as logistics services.\nIn 1855 he resigned from the post of Minister of War because he went to fight in the Crimean War. He was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 19 July 1859 to 21 January 1860. In the years immediately after the Italian unification, he was governor of Milan and Prefect of Naples.\nMember of the \"Historical Right\", La Marmora was Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Italy from 18 September 1864 to 20 July 1866. He resigned from office to go fight the third Italian independence war: on this occasion, however, he committed several strategic errors, which cost a heavy defeat for Italy.\nIn 1870 he retired from political life. He died in Florence and was buried in Biella in the church of San Sebastiano. His brother, Alessandro La Marmora, founded the corps of Bersaglieri."}

It is one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\nIt is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the central region of our galaxy. It is about 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star but interstellar gases have blocked it from view.\nProperties.\nThe Pistol Star was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in the early 1990s.\nThe star may have ejected almost 10 solar masses of material in giant outbursts perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. Its stellar wind is over 10 billion times stronger than the Sun's. The star's exact age and future are not known, but it is expected to end in a brilliant supernova or hypernova in 1 to 3 million years. Its mass is equally uncertain, probably around 200 times the sun when first formed. Now it is much less because it has lost so much mass.\nEarly reports suggested that it might be the most luminous star known, being almost 100 million times as luminous as the Sun.\nLater studies, however, have reduced its estimated luminosity. It is now regarded as a candidate luminous blue variable about one-third as luminous as the binary star system Eta Carinae. Even so, it radiates about as much energy in 20 seconds as does the Sun in a year.\nA close point source has been discovered hidden in the surrounding nebulosity, but it is not known whether it is a star or even whether it is physically associated."}

It is a free-living marine-dwelling species of dinoflagellate. \nIt shows bioluminescence when disturbed: this produces a \"milky seas effect\". The bioluminescence is produced in the cytoplasm of this single-celled protist. It is done by a luciferin-luciferase reaction in thousands of spherical organelles, called scintillons. Nonluminescent populations in the genus \"Noctiluca\" lack these scintillons.\n\"Noctiluca\" is a heterotroph (non-photosynthetic) that engulfs by phagocytosis. They eat plankton, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, fish eggs and bacteria. The diatom \"Thalassiosira\" is known as a favourite food source of \"Noctiluca\".\n\"N. scintillans\" also takes in tiny phytoplankton which live as endosymbionts. They do photosynthesis for their larger host. Diatoms are often found in the vacuoles (internal membrane-bound storage compartments) of \"Noctiluca\". The green non-feeding symbionts can grow photoautotrophically for generations. "}

The family includes 15 species of fairywren, 3 emu-wrens, and 11 grasswrens. There are six genera.\nThe Maluridae are one of the many bird families to have evolved from a great adaptive radiation of what were crows to new ecological opportunities in Australasia. Their closest relatives are the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae. \nTheir obvious similarity to the wrens of Europe and America is not genetic, but simply the consequence of convergent evolution between more-or-less unrelated species that share the same ecological niche.\nTheir behaviour is similar to many other passerine families. The males defend territory and attract females by song and bright coloured plumage. Females are a dowdy brownish colour, better for camouflage. The males' colour is much less bright out of season. They are insectivorous, and nest in dense undergrowth. The parallels with Eurasian wrens are quite striking."}

Having served as an infantry general under Alexander, he eventually took the title of basileus (~\"king\"). He set up the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered.\nAfter the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander's empire, and was made Commander of the Companions (the elite cavalry of Alexander) at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC. \nThe 'Wars of the Diadochi' in 322 were the wars of Alexander's successors. Perdiccas failed against Ptolemy in Egypt, which led to the mutiny of his troops. Perdiccas was betrayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus and others sometime in either 321 or 320 BC.\nIn 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. Almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and Antigonus forced Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. \nFrom 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Persian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire:\nSeleucus' wars took him as far as India, where, after two years of war (305-303 BC), he made peace with the Indian Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Seleucus exchanged his eastern satrapies in the Indus River Valley for 500 war elephants. These would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and against Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC.\nSeleucus' victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed in Asia and in Anatolia. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus' European territories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra. The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus' former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid Empire.\nSeleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC) and in particular Seleucia on the Tigris (ca. 305 BC), the new capital of the Seleucid Empire, a foundation that eventually depopulated Babylon."}

{"id": "479332", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479332", "title": "Abscess", "text": "An abscess () is pus that has built up within the tissue of the body. Signs and symptoms of abscesses include: redness, pain, warmth, and swelling. This swelling feels like it is filled with fluid if it is pressed. The area of redness is often bigger than the area of swelling. Carbuncles are an abscess in the hair follicles.\nAn abscess is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria can be part of a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA (methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\"). Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is proved by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.\nTreatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is to cut it open and drain out the pus. Antibiotics are usually not needed for healthy people. New studies have found that it is better to close the wound after draining, instead of packing it with gauze. This can speed healing and not increase risk of the abscess returning. Sometimes simply sucking out the pus with a needle is not enough.\nSkin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. As many as 65% of people who take intravenous drugs get abscesses In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were put in hospital in 2008 for the disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAbscesses can form in any kind of solid tissue. They are usually on the skin surface (such as a boils, or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys and tonsils. The condition can become more complicated if the pus and the infection spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to gangrene, where areas of body tissue die.\nThe main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills.\nInternal abscesses are more difficult to find. The abscess can be painful, and a person will have a high temperature, and generally feel unwell.\nInternal abscesses do not usually heal without medical treatment. In some cases an abscess could even cause death, for example where an abscess in the neck put pressure on the trachea.\nIf abscess is on the surface, it may be \"fluctuant\", that is it feels like it is full of fluid, when touched. This is a wave-like motion caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess.\nCauses.\nAbscesses are caused by bacterial infection, parasites, or foreign substances.\nBacterial infection is the most common cause. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA. Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive \"Staphylococcus aureus\" is the most common organism involved.\nRarely parasites can causes abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Specific parasites known to do this include: dracunculiasis and myiasis."}

They are unusual eukaryote organisms. For much of their life they live as separate cells. Then in hard times they come together to reproduce as a fruiting body. The fruiting body produces spores with protective walls. They survive and open up in better times. So these organisms are both unicellular and multicellular.\nAs separate amoebae, they feed and divide normally. They mostly eat soil bacteria. When the food supply runs out, they come together to form a kind of slug-like thing. The slug has a definite front and rear. It responds to light and temperature differences, and can move. Under the right conditions the slug becomes a sporocarp (fruiting body). A stalk holds up one or more balls of spores. These spores are inactive cells protected by tough cell walls. They become new amoebae when food is available.\n\"Dictyostelium\" has been used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics. It is studied as an example of cell communication, differentiation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Research on \"Dictyostelium\" is available on-line at dictyBase.\nAggregation in \"Dictyostelium\".\nThe aggregation of the amoebae relies on a signal molecule. One cell, the founder of the colony, begins to secrete the signal in response to stress. Others detect the signal, and respond in two ways:\nThe effect of this is to relay the signal through the nearby population of amoebae. They move to the area of highest signal concentration.\nDiscovery and classification.\nThey were first discovered in a North Carolina forest in 1935. \"Dictyostelium discoideum\" was at first classified under 'lower fungi'. Later it was put in the kingdoms Protista and Fungi. By the 1990s, most scientists accepted the present classification.\nAmoebozoa are now regarded as a separate kingdom-level clade, being more closely related to both animals and fungi than to plants.\nGenome.\nThe entire genome of \"Dictyostelium discoideum\" was published in \"Nature\" in 2005. The haploid genome contains about 12,500 genes on six chromosomes. For comparison, the diploid human genome has 20,00025,000 genes (represented twice) on 23 chromosome pairs.\nSexual reproduction.\nSexual development can occur when amoeboid cells are starved of their bacterial food supply and in the dark.\nMating starts by gametogenesis. This produces small, mobile gametes that fuse to form a small binucleate cell. The volume of the binucleate cell then increases to produce a giant binuclear cell. As growth proceeds, the nuclei swell, and then fuse forming a true diploid zygote giant cell. As this is occurring, amoebae undergo chemotaxis towards the giant cell surface. The zygote giant cell ingests the surrounding amoebae, and digests them. Next the zygote forms a macrocyst which stays dormant for a time before germination occurs. When the macrocyst germinates it releases many haploid amoeboid cells.\nModel host organism for \"Legionella\".\n\"Dictyostelium\" shares many molecular features with macrophages. Macrophages are the human host of \"Legionella\". The cytoskeletal composition of \"D. discoideum\" is similar to that of mammalian cells. So are the processes driven by these components, such as phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, endocytic transit and vesicle sorting. Like leukocytes, \"D. discoideum\" have chemotaxis. Hence, \"D. discoideum\" is a suitable model system to see the influence of host cell factors during \"Legionella\" infections."}

Both full-size and mid-size SUVs and CUVs have three rows of seating (8 or 9 passengers). A full size van is a marketing term used for a van larger than a minivan. Seating is one difference.

It includes the species causing a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires' disease, and a mild flu-like illness called Pontiac fever.\nIt may be seen with a silver stain. \"Legionella\" is common in many environments, including soil and aquatic systems, with at least 50 species and 70 strains identified.\nThe side-chains of the cell wall carry the bases responsible for the somatic antigen specificity of these organisms. The chemical composition of these side chains both with respect to components as well as arrangement of the different sugars determines the nature of the somatic or O antigen determinants, which are essential means of serologically classifying many Gram-negative bacteria.\n\"Legionella\" got its name after a 1976 outbreak of a then-unknown \"mystery disease\" sickened. 221 people were infected, with 34 deaths. The outbreak was first noticed among people attending a convention of the American Legion\u2014an association of U.S. military veterans.\nOn January 18, 1977, the cause was identified as a previously unknown bacterium later named \"Legionella\".\nLegionnaire's disease and Pontiac fever.\nLegionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia\u2014lung inflammation usually caused by infection. Legionnaires' disease is caused by a bacterium known as \"Legionella\".\nPeople can't catch Legionnaires' disease from person-to-person contact. Instead, most people get Legionnaires' disease from inhaling the bacteria. Older adults, smokers and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to Legionnaires' disease.\nThe \"Legionella\" bacterium also causes Pontiac fever, a milder illness resembling the flu. Separately or together, the two illnesses are sometimes called legionellosis. Pontiac fever usually clears on its own, but untreated Legionnaires' disease can be fatal. Although prompt treatment with antibiotics usually cures Legionnaires' disease, some people continue to experience problems after treatment.\nDisinfectants help people to avoid catching it."}

Some may have as many as 14. Unlike most other guitars, pedal steel guitars have reference lines on the fretboard. This is where frets would be, but there are no actual frets. The player changes the pitch of one or more strings by sliding a steel from one position to another while plucking the strings. Pedal steels are typically plucked with a thumb pick and fingers, or two or three fingerpicks. The pedals are mounted on a cross bar below the body. The action of the pedals may be fixed or changed by the player to select which strings the pedals affects. While there are some fairly standard pedal assignments, many advanced players devise their own setups, called \"copedents\". The pedal steel evolved from the console steel guitar and lap steel guitar. \nThe pedal steel, with its smooth \"portamenti\", bending chords and complex riffs, is one of the most easily recognized instruments of American country music."}

They are related to Disney character Donald Duck.\nAncestors.\nIn the comic story \"The Family Tree Spree\" (1962), Donald discovers that he has only two notable ancestors. One is Columbust Duck, who tried to prove the Flat Earth model. The other is Deadeye Dick, a stagecoach robber. If Columbust lived at the same time as Christopher Columbus, he would be Donald's oldest known relative on his father's side. On his mother's side, Donald's earliest known relative lived in the second millennium BC.\nPintail Duck was a 16th-century Duck relative. He was the first early ancestor to appear in person.\nAsa Duck was the great-great-great uncle of Grandma Duck.\nFirst generation.\nHumperdink Duck is the earliest known modern Duck family member.

His girlfriend is Daisy Duck.\nDella Duck is the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\nFethry Duck was Donald's cousin.\nWhitewater Duck was only in the story \"Log Jockey\", published in \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #267 on December, 1962. According to that story, he is a distant cousin of Donald, and works as a lumberjack in the woods.\nDudly D. Duck is a cousin of Donald. He appears in the comic story \"Why All the Crabby Ducks?\".\nNancy Duck is a female cousin of Donald.\nFourth generation.\nHuebert \"Huey\", Deuteronomy \"Dewey\", and Louis \"Louie\" Duck are Donald's three nephews. They are the identical triplet sons of Della Duck and an unnamed father.\nDugan Duck is Fethry Duck's nephew.\nCoot kin.\nThe Coot family (usually called the Coot Kin in stories) are the relatives of Grandma Duck. They and the Clan McDuck make up the third major branch of Donald's family tree. The name \"Coot\" was used by several comic authors including Carl Barks. Don Rosa was the first to show their relationship to Donald. The members of the family are shown as white Pekin ducks like Donald, although real-life coots are typically black.\nCornelius Coot (1790\u20131880) founded Duckburg.\nClinton Coot (1830-1910) was first mentioned in \"Uncle Scrooge Adventures\" #27 in the story \"Guardians of the Lost Library\", first published in July 1994. There he was introduced as the son of Cornelius Coot and the founder of The Junior Woodchucks.\nGertrude Coot (n\u00e9e Gadwall) is the wife of Clinton Coot. She is the mother of Casey and Elvira Coot (\"Grandma Duck\").\nCasey Coot (1860-c. 1960) first appeared in \"Last Sled to Dawson\", first published in June, 1988. He is an unsuccessful gold prospector. He was a friend of Scrooge McDuck during his years in the Klondike.\nGretchen Coot (n\u00e9e Grebe) is the wife of Casey Coot. She is the mother of Cuthbert and Fanny Coot.\nFanny Coot is the mother of Donald's cousin Gus Goose.\nCuthbert Coot was introduced in the story \"Webfooted Wrangler,\" first published in April 1945. He is a distant cousin of Donald Duck. He is a rancher.\nKildare Coot was introduced by artist Romano Scarpa.

He is the son of Goosetave and Daphne Gander.\nShamrock Gander is Gladstone's nephew.\nClyde is another nephew of Gladstone's.\nCharacters surnamed \"Duck\" of uncertain relationship.\nThis section contains a list of characters with the surname \"Duck\" who may or may not be related to Donald. As Don Rosa explained, \"Duck\" is an understandably common name in Duckburg (just as \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" are common in the real-life United States) and does not necessarily identify a blood relation of Donald.\n0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier are a secret-agent duo.\nApril, May, and June Duck are the triplet nieces of Daisy Duck.\nBelle Duck is a plus-sized, tall and elegant duck lady.\nDaisy Duck is Donald's girlfriend. Huey, Dewey, and Louie sometimes call her \"Aunt Daisy\". It is unclear if she is their real aunt.\nDarkwing Duck is the protagonist of a TV series named after him. He is most likely not related to Donald because \"Darkwing Duck\" is the character's superhero identity. His name in private life is Drake Mallard.\nDexter Duck, like Gladstone Gander, conpetes with Donald Duck to get Daisy Duck's attention.\nDickie Duck () was introduced as Goldie O'Gilt's granddaughter. But in the story \"Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park\" by Romano Scarpa she calls Huey, Dewey and Louie \"cuginetti\" (small/young cousins) and then \"cugini\" (cousins). This might mean that she and Donald's nephews share the same surname in English language because of a kinship.\nDimwitty Duck originally appears as an assistant of Donald Duck.\nHustler Duck is an obscure character that works as a marketing man.\nMoby Duck appears to be a relative of Donald's. Their relationship is never specifically described. His name is a spoof of \"Moby-Dick\".\nThe identity of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father is something of a mystery. The character does not appear in any stories."}
